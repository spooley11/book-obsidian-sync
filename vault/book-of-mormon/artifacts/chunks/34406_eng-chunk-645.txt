12 And  for  this  cause  they  were 
brought  down  into  the  land  of 
Zara hemla; and they ever had been 
a protected by the Nephites.

13 But it came to pass that when 
they saw the danger, and the many 
a afflictions and tribulations which 
the  Nephites  bore  for  them,  they

were moved with compassion and 
were b desirous to take up arms in 
the defence of their country.

14 But behold, as they were about 
to take their weapons of war, they 
were  overpowered  by  the  persua-
sions of Helaman and his brethren, 
for they were about to  a break the 
b oath which they had made.

15 And  Helaman  feared  lest  by 
so  doing  they  should  lose  their 
souls; therefore all those who had 
entered  into  this  covenant  were 
compelled to behold their brethren 
wade through their afflictions, in 
their  dangerous  circumstances  at  
this time.

16 But  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
they had many a sons, who had not 
entered into a covenant that they 
would  not  take  their  weapons  of 
war to defend themselves against 
their  enemies;  therefore  they  did 
assemble themselves together at this 
time, as many as were able to take 
up arms, and they called themselves  
Nephites.

17 And  they  entered  into  a  cov-
enant to fight for the liberty of the 
Nephites, yea, to protect the land 
unto the a laying down of their lives; 
yea, even they covenanted that they 
never would give up their b liberty, 
but they would fight in all cases to 
protect the Nephites and themselves 
from bondage.

18 Now  behold,  there  were  two 
thousand of those young men, who 
entered into this covenant and took 
their  weapons  of  war  to  defend 
their country.

19 And now behold, as they never 
had hitherto been a disadvantage 
to the Nephites, they became now 
at this period of time also a great 
support; for they took their weap-
ons  of  war,  and  they  would  that 
Helaman should be their leader.

20 And they were all young men,
