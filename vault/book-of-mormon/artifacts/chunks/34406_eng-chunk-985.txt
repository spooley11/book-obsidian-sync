7 And ye may a know that he is, by  
the power of the Holy Ghost; where-
fore I would exhort you that ye deny 
not the power of God; for he worketh 
by  power,  b according  to  the  faith 
of  the  children  of  men,  the  same 
today and tomorrow, and forever.

8 And  again,  I  exhort  you,  my 
brethren,  that  ye  deny  not  the 
a gifts  of  God,  for  they  are  many; 
and they come from the same God. 
And there are b different ways that 
these gifts are administered; but it 
is the same God who worketh all in 
all; and they are given by the mani-
festations of the c Spirit of God unto 
men, to profit them.

9 a For behold, to one is given by 
the Spirit of God, that he may b teach 
the word of wisdom;

10 And  to  another,  that  he  may 
a teach the word of b knowledge by 
the same Spirit;

11 And  to  another,  exceedingly 
great  a faith;  and  to  another,  the 
gifts of b healing by the same Spirit;
12 And again, to another, that he

may work mighty a miracles;

13 And again, to another, that he 
may prophesy concerning all things;
14 And again, to another, the be-
holding of angels and ministering 
spirits;

15 And again, to another, all kinds

of tongues;

16 And again, to another, the in-
terpretation  of  a languages  and  of 
divers kinds of tongues.

17 And all these gifts come by the

Spirit of Christ; and they come unto 
every man severally, according as 
he will.

18 And  I  would  exhort  you,  my 
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that  a every good  b gift cometh 
of Christ.

19 And  I  would  exhort  you,  my 
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that he is the a same yesterday, 
today,  and  forever,  and  that  all 
these gifts of which I have spoken, 
which are spiritual, never will be 
done away, even as long as the world 
shall stand, only according to the 
b unbelief of the children of men.

20 Wherefore, there must be a faith; 
and if there must be faith there must 
also be hope; and if there must be 
hope there must also be charity.
