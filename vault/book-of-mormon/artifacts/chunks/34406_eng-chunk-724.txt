11 Therefore he was constrained 
to  speak  more  unto  them  saying: 
Behold, my brethren, have ye not 
read that God gave power unto one 
man, even Moses, to smite upon the 
waters  of  the  a Red  Sea,  and  they 
parted hither and thither, insomuch

that  the  Israelites,  who  were  our 
fathers,  came  through  upon  dry 
ground, and the waters closed upon 
the  armies  of  the  Egyptians  and 
swallowed them up?

12 And now behold, if God gave 
unto  this  man  such  power,  then 
why should ye dispute among your-
selves, and say that he hath given 
unto me no power whereby I may 
a know  concerning  the  judgments 
that  shall  come  upon  you  except 
ye repent?

13 But, behold, ye not only deny 
my words, but ye also deny all the 
words  which  have  been  spoken 
by our fathers, and also the words 
which  were  spoken  by  this  man, 
Moses, who had such great power 
given  unto  him,  yea,  the  words 
which he hath spoken concerning 
the coming of the Messiah.

14 Yea, did he not bear record that 
the Son of God should come? And 
as he a lifted up the brazen serpent 
in the wilderness, even so shall he 
be lifted up who should come.

15 And  as  many  as  should  look 
upon that serpent should a live, even 
so as many as should look upon the 
Son of God with faith, having a con-
trite spirit, might b live, even unto 
that life which is eternal.

16 And  now  behold,  Moses  did 
not only testify of these things, but 
also a all the holy prophets, from his 
days even to the days of Abraham.
17 Yea, and behold, a Abraham saw 
of his coming, and was filled with 
gladness and did rejoice.

18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, 
that  Abraham  not  only  knew  of 
these things, but there were a many 
before  the  days  of  Abraham  who 
were called by the  b order of God;
