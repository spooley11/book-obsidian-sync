made them known unto me.

32 And Zeezrom said again: Who 
is he that shall come? Is it the Son 
of God?

33 And he said unto him, Yea.
34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall 
he  save  his  people  a in  their  sins? 
And  Amulek  answered  and  said 
unto him: I say unto you he shall 
not, for it is impossible for him to 
deny his word.

35 Now  Zeezrom  said  unto  the 
people: See that ye remember these 
things; for he said there is but one 
God;  yet  he  saith  that  the  Son  of 
God shall come, but he shall  a not 
save his people—as though he had 
authority to command God.

36 Now Amulek saith again unto 
him:  Behold  thou  hast  a lied,  for 
thou sayest that I spake as though 
I  had  authority  to  command  God 
because I said he shall not save his 
people in their sins.

37 And I say unto you again that 
he cannot save them in their a sins; 
for I cannot deny his word, and he 
hath  said  that  b no  unclean  thing 
can inherit the c kingdom of heaven; 
therefore,  how  can  ye  be  saved, 
except  ye  inherit  the  kingdom  of 
heaven?  Therefore,  ye  cannot  be 
saved in your sins.

38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto 
him:  Is  the  Son  of  God  the  very 
Eternal Father?

39 And  Amulek  said  unto  him: 
Yea, he is the very a Eternal Father

of  heaven  and  of  earth,  and  b all 
things which in them are; he is the 
beginning  and  the  end,  the  first 
and the last;

40 And  he  shall  come  into  the 
a world to b redeem his people; and 
he shall c take upon him the trans-
gressions of those who believe on 
his name; and these are they that 
shall  have  eternal  life,  and  salva-
tion cometh to none else.

41 Therefore the wicked remain as 
though there had been a no redemp-
tion made, except it be the loosing 
of the bands of death; for behold, 
the day cometh that b all shall rise 
from  the  dead  and  stand  before 
God, and be  c judged according to 
their works.

42 Now,  there  is  a  death  which 
is  called  a  temporal  death;  and 
the death of Christ shall loose the 
a bands of this temporal death, that 
all shall be raised from this temporal  
death.
