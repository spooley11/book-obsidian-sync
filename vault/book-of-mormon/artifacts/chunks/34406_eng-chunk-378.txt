14 And it came to pass that after

he had poured out his whole soul 
to God, the a voice of the Lord came 
to him, saying:

15 Blessed  art  thou,  Alma,  and 
blessed are they who were baptized 
in the a waters of Mormon. Thou art 
blessed  because  of  thy  exceeding 
b faith  in  the  words  alone  of  my 
servant Abinadi.

16 And blessed are they because of 
their exceeding faith in the words 
alone which thou hast spoken unto 
them.

17 And blessed art thou because 
thou  hast  established  a  a church 
among this people; and they shall 
be  established,  and  they  shall  be 
my people.

18 Yea, blessed is this people who 
are willing to bear my  a name; for 
in my  b name shall they be called; 
and they are mine.

19 And because thou hast inquired 
of me concerning the transgressor, 
thou art blessed.

20 Thou art my servant; and I cov-
enant with thee that thou shalt have 
a eternal life; and thou shalt serve 
me and go forth in my name, and 
shalt gather together my sheep.

21 And he that will hear my voice 
shall be my a sheep; and him shall 
ye receive into the church, and him 
will I also receive.

22 For behold, a this is my b church; 
whosoever is c baptized shall be bap-
tized unto repentance. And whom-
soever ye receive shall d believe in 
my  name;  and  him  will  I  freely  
e forgive.

23 For it is I that taketh upon me  
the a sins of the world; for it is I that  
hath b created them; and it is I that 
granteth  unto  him  that  believeth
