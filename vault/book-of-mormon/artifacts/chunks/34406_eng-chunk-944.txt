ETHER 10  : 30–11  : 10

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that 
Hearthom reigned in the stead of 
his father. And when Hearthom had 
reigned twenty and four years, be-
hold, the kingdom was taken away 
from  him.  And  he  served  many 
years in a captivity, yea, even all the 
remainder of his days.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
prophets  were  a rejected  by  the 
people, and they fled unto Com for 
protection, for the people sought to 
destroy them.

3 And they prophesied unto Com 
many things; and he was blessed in 
all the remainder of his days.

31 And he begat Heth, and Heth 
lived in captivity all his days. And 
Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt 
in captivity all his days; and he be-
gat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah 
also dwelt in captivity all his days; 
and he begat Coriantum, and Cori-
antum  dwelt  in  captivity  all  his 
days; and he begat Com.

32 And it came to pass that Com 
drew away the half of the kingdom. 
And  he  reigned  over  the  half  of 
the kingdom forty and two years; 
and he went to battle against the 
king,  Amgid,  and  they  fought  for 
the  space  of  many  years,  during 
which time Com gained power over 
Amgid, and obtained power over the 
remainder of the kingdom.
