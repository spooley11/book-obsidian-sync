CHAPTER 23
Alma refuses to be king—He serves as 
high  priest—The  Lord  chastens  His 
people, and the Lamanites conquer the 
land of Helam—Amulon, leader of King 
Noah’s wicked priests, rules subject to the 
Lamanite monarch. About 145–121 b.c.
Now  Alma,  having  been  a warned 
of the Lord that the armies of king 
Noah would come upon them, and 
having made it known to his people, 
therefore  they  gathered  together 
their flocks, and took of their grain, 
and b departed into the wilderness 
before the armies of king Noah.

2 And  the  Lord  did  strengthen 
them, that the people of king Noah 
could not overtake them to destroy 
them.

3 And they fled a eight days’ jour-

ney into the wilderness.

4 And  they  came  to  a  land,  yea, 
even a very beautiful and pleasant 
land, a land of pure water.

5 And  they  pitched  their  tents, 
and began to till the ground, and

began to build buildings; yea, they 
were  a industrious,  and  did  labor 
exceedingly.

6 And  the  people  were  desirous 
that  Alma  should  be  their  a king, 
for he was beloved by his people.

7 But he said unto them: Behold, 
it is not expedient that we should 
have a king; for thus saith the Lord: 
Ye shall a not esteem one flesh above 
another, or one man shall not think 
himself  above  another;  therefore 
I say unto you it is not expedient 
that ye should have a king.

8 Nevertheless, if it a were possible 
that ye could always have just men 
to be your b kings it would be well 
for you to have a king.

9 But remember the  a iniquity of 
king  Noah  and  his  b priests;  and  I 
myself was c caught in a snare, and 
did many things which were abomi-
nable in the sight of the Lord, which 
caused me sore d repentance;
