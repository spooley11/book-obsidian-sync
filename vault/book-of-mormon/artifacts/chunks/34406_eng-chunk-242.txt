12 And now I, Jacob, spake many 
more  things  unto  the  people  of 
Nephi, a warning them against b for-
nication  and  c lasciviousness,  and 
every kind of sin, telling them the 
awful consequences of them.

13 And  a  hundredth  part  of  the 
proceedings of this people, which 
now  began  to  be  numerous,  can-
not be written upon a these plates;

but many of their proceedings are 
written upon the b larger plates, and 
their wars, and their contentions, 
and the reigns of their kings.

14 a These  plates  are  called  the 
plates of Jacob, and they were b made 
by the hand of Nephi. And I make 
an end of speaking these words.

CHAPTER 4
All the prophets worshiped the Father 
in the name of Christ—Abraham’s of-
fering of Isaac was in similitude of God 
and His Only Begotten—Men should 
reconcile themselves to God through the 
Atonement—The  Jews  will  reject  the 
foundation stone. About 544–421 b.c.
Now  behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
I,  Jacob,  having  ministered  much 
unto  my  people  in  word,  (and  I 
cannot  write  but  a  a little  of  my 
words, because of the b difficulty of 
engraving our words upon plates) 
and we know that the things which 
we write upon plates must remain;
2 But whatsoever things we write 
upon  anything  save  it  be  upon 
a plates must perish and vanish away; 
but we can write a few words upon 
plates,  which  will  give  our  chil-
dren, and also our beloved breth-
ren,  a  small  degree  of  knowledge 
concerning us, or concerning their  
fathers—

3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; 
and we labor diligently to engraven 
these  words  upon  plates,  hoping 
that our beloved brethren and our 
children  will  receive  them  with 
thankful  hearts,  and  look  upon 
them that they may learn with joy 
and not with sorrow, neither with 
contempt,  concerning  their  first 
a parents.
