8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
a Amulon began to exercise b author-
ity over Alma and his brethren, and 
began to persecute him, and cause 
that his children should persecute 
their children.

9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he 
had been a one of the king’s priests, 
and that it was he that believed the 
words of Abinadi and was driven 
out before the king, and therefore 
he was wroth with him; for he was 
subject to king Laman, yet he exer-
cised authority over them, and put 
b tasks  upon  them,  and  put  c task-
masters over them.

10 And it came to pass that so great 
were their afflictions that they be-
gan to cry mightily to God.

11 And Amulon commanded them 
that they should stop their cries; and  
he a put guards over them to watch 
them,  that  whosoever  should  be 
found  calling  upon  God  should  
be put to death.

12 And Alma and his people did 
not  raise  their  voices  to  the  Lord 
their  God,  but  did  pour  out  their 
a hearts to him; and he did know the 
b thoughts of their hearts.

13 And it  a came to pass that the 
voice of the Lord came to them in 
their  afflictions,  saying:  Lift  up
