9 But behold, I am consigned that 
these are my days, and that my soul 
shall be filled with a sorrow because of 
this the wickedness of my brethren.
10 And behold, now it came to pass  
that it was upon a tower, which was  
in  the  a garden  of  Nephi,  which  
was by the highway which led to  
the chief market, which was in the  
city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi 
had bowed himself upon the tower 
which  was  in  his  garden,  which 
tower was also near unto the garden  
gate by which led the highway.

11 And it came to pass that there 
were  certain  men  passing  by  and 
saw Nephi as he was pouring out his 
soul unto God upon the a tower; and 
they ran and told the people what 
they had seen, and the people came 
together  in  multitudes  that  they 
might know the cause of so great  
mourning  for  the  wickedness  of 
the people.

12 And now, when Nephi arose he 
beheld  the  multitudes  of  people 
who had gathered together.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
opened  his  mouth  and  said  unto 
them: Behold, a why have ye gath-
ered  yourselves  together?  That  I  
may tell you of your iniquities?

14 Yea,  because  I  have  got  upon 
my  tower  that  I  might  pour  out 
my soul unto my God, because of 
the exceeding sorrow of my heart, 
which is because of your iniquities!
15 And because of my a mourning 
and lamentation ye have gathered 
yourselves  together,  and  do  mar-
vel;  yea,  and  ye  have  great  need 
to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel 
because ye are given away that the 
devil  has  got  so  great  hold  upon  
your hearts.

16 Yea, how could you have given 
way  to  the  enticing  of  him  who  
is seeking to hurl away your souls 
down  to  a everlasting  misery  and 
endless wo?

17 O repent ye, repent ye!  a Why 
will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto 
the  Lord  your  God.  Why  has  he 
forsaken you?

18 It  is  because  you  have  hard-
ened your hearts; yea, ye will not 
a hearken unto the voice of the b good 
shepherd;  yea,  ye  have  c provoked 
him to anger against you.
