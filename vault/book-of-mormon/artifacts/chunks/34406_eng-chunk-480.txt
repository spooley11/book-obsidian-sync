37 But  behold,  every  man  that 
lifted his club to smite Ammon, he 
smote off their arms with his sword; 
for he did withstand their blows by 
smiting  their  arms  with  the  edge 
of  his  sword,  insomuch  that  they 
began to be astonished, and began  
to  flee  before  him;  yea,  and  they  
were  not  few  in  number;  and  he 
caused them to flee by the strength  
of his arm.

38 Now six of them had fallen by 
the sling, but he a slew none save it 
were their leader with his sword; 
and he smote off as many of their 
arms  as  were  lifted  against  him, 
and they were not a few.

39 And when he had driven them 
afar off, he returned and they wa-
tered their flocks and returned them 
to the pasture of the king, and then 
went in unto the king, bearing the 
arms which had been smitten off 
by the sword of Ammon, of those 
who sought to slay him; and they 
were carried in unto the king for a 
testimony of the things which they 
had done.

CHAPTER 18

King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is 
the Great Spirit—Ammon teaches the 
king  about  the  Creation,  God’s  deal-
ings  with  men,  and  the  redemption 
that  comes  through  Christ—Lamoni 
believes and falls to the earth as if dead. 
About 90 b.c.
And it came to pass that king La-
moni  caused  that  his  a servants 
should  stand  forth  and  testify  to 
all the things which they had seen 
concerning the matter.

2 And when they had all testified 
to the things which they had seen, 
and he had learned of the faithful-
ness  of  Ammon  in  preserving  his 
flocks, and also of his a great power 
in  contending  against  those  who 
sought to slay him, he was aston-
ished exceedingly, and said: Surely, 
this  is  more  than  a  man.  Behold, 
is  not  this  the  Great  Spirit  who 
doth send such great punishments 
upon this people, because of their 
murders?
