sons should be gathered together, 
that he might give unto them every 
one  his  a charge,  separately,  con-

count of his commandments, which 
he  gave  unto  them  according  to  
his own record.

The commandments of Alma to his 
son Helaman.

Comprising chapters 36 and 37.

CHAPTER 36

Alma testifies to Helaman of his conver-

the pains of a damned soul; he called upon 
the name of Jesus, and was then born of 
God—Sweet joy filled his soul—He saw 
concourses of angels praising God—Many 
converts have tasted and seen as he has 
tasted and seen. About 74 b.c.

Isaac,  and  the  God  of  Jacob;  and 
he surely did deliver them in their  
afflictions.

behold, thou art in thy youth, and 
therefore,  I  beseech  of  thee  that 
thou wilt hear my words and learn

troubles, and their afflictions, and 
shall be c lifted up at the last day.

temporal but of the spiritual, not of 
the b carnal mind but of God.
