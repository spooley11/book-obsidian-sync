26 Now it came to pass that when 
it was night, I caused that my men 
should  not  sleep,  but  that  they 
should march forward by another 
way towards the land of Manti.

27 And because of this our march 
in  the  night-time,  behold,  on  the 
morrow we were beyond the Laman-
ites,  insomuch  that  we  did  arrive 
before them at the city of Manti.

28 And thus it came to pass, that 
by this stratagem we did take pos-
session of the city of Manti without 
the shedding of blood.

29 And it came to pass that when 
the  armies  of  the  Lamanites  did

arrive near the city, and saw that 
we  were  prepared  to  meet  them, 
they were astonished exceedingly 
and  struck  with  great  fear,  inso-
much that they did  a flee into the  
wilderness.

30 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that 
the armies of the Lamanites did flee 
out of all this quarter of the land. 
But behold, they have carried with 
them  many  women  and  children 
out of the land.

31 And  a those  cities  which  had 
been taken by the Lamanites, all of 
them are at this period of time in 
our possession; and our fathers and 
our women and our children are re-
turning to their homes, all save it be  
those who have been taken prisoners 
and carried off by the Lamanites.

32 But behold, our armies are small 
to maintain so great a number of 
cities and so great possessions.

33 But behold, we a trust in our God 
who has given us victory over those 
lands, insomuch that we have ob-
tained those cities and those lands, 
which were our own.

34 Now we do not know the a cause 
that the government does not grant 
us more strength; neither do those 
men  who  came  up  unto  us  know 
why we have not received greater 
strength.

35 Behold,  we  do  not  know  but 
what a ye are unsuccessful, and ye 
have  drawn  away  the  forces  into 
that quarter of the land; if so, we 
do not desire to murmur.

36 And if it is not so, behold, we 
fear that there is some a faction in 
the government, that they do not 
send  more  men  to  our  assistance; 
for  we  know  that  they  are  more 
numerous  than  that  which  they  
have sent.
