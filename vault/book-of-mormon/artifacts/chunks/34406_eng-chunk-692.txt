21 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni, who was the chief judge, did 
flee  before  Coriantumr,  even  to 
the walls of the city. And it came 
to pass that Coriantumr did smite 
him against the wall, insomuch that 
he died. And thus ended the days 
of Pacumeni.

22 And  now  when  Coriantumr 
saw  that  he  was  in  possession  of 
the city of Zarahemla, and saw that 
the Nephites had fled before them, 
and were slain, and were taken, and 
were cast into prison, and that he 
had obtained the possession of the 
strongest hold in all the land, his 
heart a took courage insomuch that 
he was about to go forth against all 
the land.

23 And  now  he  did  not  tarry  in 
the land of Zarahemla, but he did 
march forth with a large army, even 
towards the city of a Bountiful; for 
it was his determination to go forth 
and cut his way through with the 
sword,  that  he  might  obtain  the 
north parts of the land.

24 And, supposing that their great-
est strength was in the center of the 
land, therefore he did march forth, 
giving  them  no  time  to  assemble 
themselves together save it were in 
small  bodies;  and  in  this  manner 
they  did  fall  upon  them  and  cut 
them down to the earth.

25 But behold, this march of Co-
riantumr through the center of the 
land gave Moronihah great advan-
tage  over  them,  notwithstanding 
the greatness of the number of the 
Nephites who were slain.

26 For  behold,  Moronihah  had

supposed that the Lamanites durst 
not  come  into  the  center  of  the 
land, but that they would attack the  
cities round about in the borders 
as they had hitherto done; there-
fore  Moronihah  had  caused  that 
their strong armies should main-
tain those parts round about by the  
borders.
