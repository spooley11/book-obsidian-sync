upon their friends and their families  
also, that they were not confounded.
38 And it came to pass that Jared 
spake again unto his brother, say-
ing:  Go  and  a inquire  of  the  Lord 
whether he will drive us out of the 
land, and if he will drive us out of 
the land, cry unto him whither we 
shall go. And who knoweth but the 
Lord will carry us forth into a land 
which is b choice above all the earth? 
And  if  it  so  be,  let  us  be  faithful 
unto the Lord, that we may receive 
it for our inheritance.

39 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did cry unto the 
Lord according to that which had 
been spoken by the mouth of Jared.
40 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did hear the brother of Jared, 
and  a had  compassion  upon  him, 
and said unto him:

41 Go to and gather together thy 
a flocks,  both  male  and  female,  of 
every kind; and also of the b seed of 
the  earth  of  every  kind;  and  c thy 
d families; and also Jared thy brother 
and his family; and also thy e friends 
and their families, and the friends 
of Jared and their families.

42 And when thou hast done this 
thou shalt a go at the head of them 
down into the valley which is north-
ward. And there will I meet thee, 
and  I  will  go  b before  thee  into  a 
land which is c choice above all the 
lands of the earth.
