CHAPTER 8

The  baptism  of  little  children  is  an 
evil abomination—Little children are 
alive  in  Christ  because  of  the  Atone-
ment—Faith, repentance, meekness and 
lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy 
Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to 
salvation. About a.d. 401–21.
An epistle of my a father Mormon,

my  prayers,  continually  praying 
unto God the Father in the name 
of  his  Holy  Child,  Jesus,  that  he, 
through his infinite a goodness and 
b grace, will keep you through the 
endurance of faith on his name to 
the end.

4 And now, my son, I speak unto 
you concerning that which griev-
eth me exceedingly; for it grieveth 
me that there should a disputations 
rise among you.

5 For, if I have learned the truth, 
there have been disputations among 
you concerning the baptism of your 
little children.

6 And now, my son, I desire that 
ye should labor diligently, that this 
gross error should be removed from

among you; for, for this intent I have 
written this epistle.

7 For  immediately  after  I  had  
learned  these  things  of  you  I  in-
quired of the Lord concerning the 
matter. And the a word of the Lord 
came  to  me  by  the  power  of  the 
Holy Ghost, saying:
