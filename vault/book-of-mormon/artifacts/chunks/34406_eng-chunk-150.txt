have a perfect knowledge of their 
enjoyment, and their f righteousness, 
being  g clothed  with  h purity,  yea, 
even with the i robe of righteousness.
15 And it shall come to pass that 
when all men shall have passed from 
this first death unto life, insomuch 
as they have become immortal, they 
must appear before the a judgment- 
seat of the Holy One of Israel; and 
then  cometh  the  b judgment,  and 
then must they be judged according  
to the holy judgment of God.

16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth,  
for the Lord God hath spoken it, and 
it is his eternal a word, which cannot 
b pass away, that they who are righ-
teous shall be righteous still, and 
they who are c filthy shall be d filthy 
still; wherefore, they who are filthy 
are the  e devil and his angels; and 
they shall go away into f everlasting 
fire, prepared for them; and their 
g torment  is  as  a  h lake  of  fire  and 
brimstone, whose flame ascendeth 
up forever and ever and has no end.
17 O the greatness and the a justice 
of our God! For he executeth all his  
words,  and  they  have  gone  forth 
out of his mouth, and his law must 
be b fulfilled.

18 But,  behold,  the  a righteous, 
the  b saints  of  the  Holy  One  of  Is-
rael, they who have believed in the 
Holy One of Israel, they who have

endured the c crosses of the world, 
and despised the shame of it, they 
shall d inherit the e kingdom of God, 
which was prepared for them f from 
the  foundation  of  the  world,  and 
their g joy shall be full h forever.

19 O  the  greatness  of  the  mercy 
of our God, the Holy One of Israel! 
For he a delivereth his saints from 
that b awful monster the devil, and 
death,  and  c hell,  and  that  lake  of 
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment.
