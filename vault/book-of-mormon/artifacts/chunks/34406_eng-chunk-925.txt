4 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  prepared  all  manner  of 
a food, that thereby they might sub-
sist upon the water, and also food for 
their flocks and herds, and b what-
soever beast or animal or fowl that 
they should carry with them—and 
it came to pass that when they had 
done all these things they got aboard 
of their vessels or barges, and set 
forth  into  the  sea,  commending 
themselves unto the Lord their God.
5 And it came to pass that the Lord 
God caused that there should be a 
a furious wind blow upon the face 
of the waters,  b towards the prom-
ised land; and thus they were tossed 
upon  the  waves  of  the  sea  before 
the wind.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were  many  times  buried  in  the 
depths  of  the  sea,  because  of  the 
mountain waves which broke upon 
them, and also the great and terri-
ble tempests which were caused by 
the fierceness of the wind.

7 And it came to pass that when 
they were buried in the deep there 
was no water that could hurt them, 
their vessels being a tight like unto 
a  dish,  and  also  they  were  tight 
like unto the  b ark of Noah; there-
fore when they were encompassed 
about by many waters they did cry 
unto  the  Lord,  and  he  did  bring 
them forth again upon the top of 
the waters.

8 And it came to pass that the wind 
did  never  cease  to  blow  towards 
the promised land while they were 
upon the waters; and thus they were 
a driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did a sing praises unto 
the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared 
did sing praises unto the Lord, and 
he did b thank and praise the Lord 
all the day long; and when the night 
came, they did not cease to praise 
the Lord.

10 And thus they were driven forth; 
and  no  monster  of  the  sea  could  
break  them,  neither  a whale  that 
could mar them; and they did have 
light  continually,  whether  it  was 
above the water or under the water.
11 And  thus  they  were  driven 
forth, a three hundred and forty and 
four days upon the water.
