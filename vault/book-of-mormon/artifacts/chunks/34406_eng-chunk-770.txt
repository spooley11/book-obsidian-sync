19 Now it was the custom among 
all the Nephites to appoint for their 
chief captains, (save it were in their 
times of wickedness) some one that 
had  the  a spirit  of  revelation  and 
also prophecy; therefore, this Gid-
giddoni was a great prophet among 
them, as also was the chief judge.
20 Now the people said unto Gid-
giddoni: a Pray unto the Lord, and let 
us go up upon the mountains and 
into  the  wilderness,  that  we  may 
fall upon the robbers and destroy 
them in their own lands.

21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: 
The Lord a forbid; for if we should 
go up against them the Lord would 
b deliver us into their hands; there-
fore  we  will  prepare  ourselves  in 
the center of our lands, and we will 
gather all our armies together, and 
we will not go against them, but we  
will wait till they shall come against 
us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if 
we do this he will deliver them into 
our hands.

22 And it came to pass in the sev-
enteenth year, in the latter end of 
the  year,  the  proclamation  of  La-
choneus had gone forth throughout 
all the face of the land, and they 
had taken their a horses, and their 
chariots,  and  their  cattle,  and  all 
their  flocks,  and  their  herds,  and 
their grain, and all their substance, 
and did march forth by thousands 
and by tens of thousands, until they 
had  all  gone  forth  to  the  b place 
which  c had  been  appointed  that 
they should gather themselves to-
gether, to defend themselves against  
their enemies.
