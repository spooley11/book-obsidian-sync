27 And he turned from them again, 
and went a little way off and bowed 
himself to the earth; and he prayed 
again unto the Father, saying:

28 Father, I thank thee that thou 
hast  a purified those whom I have 
chosen, because of their faith, and

I pray for them, and also for them 
who shall believe on their words, 
that  they  may  be  purified  in  me, 
through faith on their words, even 
as they are purified in me.

29 Father, I pray not for the world, 
but for those whom thou hast given 
me  a out  of  the  world,  because  of 
their faith, that they may be purified  
in me, that I may be in them as thou, 
Father, art in me, that we may be 
one, that I may be glorified in them.
30 And  when  Jesus  had  spoken 
these  words  he  came  again  unto 
his disciples; and behold they did 
pray  steadfastly,  without  ceasing, 
unto him; and he did smile upon 
them again; and behold they were 
a white, even as Jesus.

31 And it came to pass that he went 
again a little way off and prayed 
unto the Father;

32 And tongue cannot speak the 
words  which  he  prayed,  neither 
can be a written by man the words 
which he prayed.

33 And the multitude did hear and 
do  bear  record;  and  their  a hearts 
were open and they did understand 
in their hearts the words which he 
prayed.

34 Nevertheless, so great and mar-
velous  were  the  words  which  he 
prayed  that  they  cannot  be  writ-
ten,  neither  can  they  be  a uttered  
by man.

35 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of praying 
he came again to the disciples, and 
said unto them: a So great b faith have 
I  never  seen  among  all  the  Jews; 
wherefore  I  could  not  show  unto 
them  so  great  c miracles,  because 
of their d unbelief.
