41 And moreover, I would desire 
that  ye  should  consider  on  the  
blessed and  a happy state of those 
that  keep  the  commandments  of 
God. For behold, they are b blessed 
in  all  things,  both  temporal  and  
spiritual; and if they hold out c faith-
ful  to  the  end  they  are  received 
into  d heaven,  that  thereby  they 
may dwell with God in a state of 
never-ending happiness. O remem-
ber,  remember  that  these  things 
are  true;  for  the  Lord  God  hath  
spoken it.

CHAPTER 3

King Benjamin continues his address—
The  Lord  Omnipotent  will  minister 
among men in a tabernacle of clay—
Blood will come from every pore as He 
atones for the sins of the world—His 
is  the  only  name  whereby  salvation 
comes—Men  can  put  off  the  natural 
man  and  become  Saints  through  the 
Atonement—The torment of the wicked 
will be as a lake of fire and brimstone.

And again my brethren, I would call 
your attention, for I have somewhat 
more to speak unto you; for behold, 
I have things to tell you concerning 
that which is to come.

you are made known unto me by 
an  a angel  from  God.  And  he  said 
unto me: b Awake; and I awoke, and 
behold he stood before me.

3 And  he  said  unto  me:  Awake, 
and hear the words which I shall 
tell thee; for behold, I am come to 
declare unto you the a glad tidings 
of great b joy.

4 For  the  Lord  hath  heard  thy 
prayers,  and  hath  judged  of  thy 
a righteousness, and hath sent me to 
declare  unto  thee  that  thou  may-
est  rejoice;  and  that  thou  mayest 
declare unto thy people, that they 
may also be filled with joy.

5 For  behold,  the  time  cometh, 
and  is  not  far  distant,  that  with 
power, the a Lord b Omnipotent who 
c reigneth,  who  was,  and  is  from 
all  d eternity  to  all  eternity,  shall 
come down from heaven among the
