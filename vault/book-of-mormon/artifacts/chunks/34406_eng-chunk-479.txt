31 And it came to pass that he flat-
tered them by his words, saying: My 
brethren, be of good cheer and let 
us go in search of the flocks, and 
we will gather them together and 
bring them back unto the place of 
water;  and  thus  we  will  preserve 
the  flocks  unto  the  king  and  he 
will not slay us.

32 And it came to pass that they 
went  in  search  of  the  flocks,  and 
they did follow Ammon, and they 
rushed forth with much swiftness 
and  did  head  the  flocks  of  the 
king, and did gather them together  
again to the place of water.

33 And those men again stood to 
scatter  their  flocks;  but  Ammon 
said  unto  his  brethren:  Encircle 
the  flocks  round  about  that  they 
flee not; and I go and contend with 
these men who do scatter our flocks.
34 Therefore, they did as Ammon 
commanded them, and he went forth  
and  stood  to  contend  with  those 
who stood by the waters of Sebus; 
and they were in number not a few.
35 Therefore  they  did  not  fear 
Ammon,  for  they  supposed  that 
one  of  their  men  could  slay  him 
according  to  their  pleasure,  for 
they  knew  not  that  the  Lord  had

promised  Mosiah  that  he  would 
a deliver his sons out of their hands; 
neither  did  they  know  anything 
concerning  the  Lord;  therefore 
they delighted in the destruction of 
their brethren; and for this cause 
they stood to scatter the flocks of 
the king.

36 But  a Ammon  stood  forth  and 
began to cast stones at them with 
his sling; yea, with mighty power 
he did sling stones amongst them; 
and thus he slew a b certain number 
of them insomuch that they began 
to be astonished at his power; nev-
ertheless they were angry because 
of the slain of their brethren, and 
they  were  determined  that  he 
should  fall;  therefore,  seeing  that 
they c could not hit him with their 
stones, they came forth with clubs to  
slay him.
