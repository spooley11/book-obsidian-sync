commanded  of  the  Lord  to  make 
a these plates; wherefore, the record 
of my father, and the genealogy of 
his fathers, and the more part of all 
our proceedings in the wilderness 
are engraven upon those first plates 
of which I have spoken; wherefore, 
the things which transpired before 
I made b these plates are, of a truth, 
more  particularly  made  mention 
upon the first plates.

3 And after I had made these plates 
by way of commandment, I, Nephi, 
received a commandment that the 
ministry  and  the  prophecies,  the 
more  plain  and  precious  parts  of 
them, should be written upon a these 
plates;  and  that  the  things  which 
were  written  should  be  kept  for 
the instruction of my people, who 
should  possess  the  land,  and  also 
for  other  b wise  purposes,  which 
purposes are known unto the Lord.
4 Wherefore,  I,  Nephi,  did  make  
a  record  upon  the  a other  plates, 
which gives an account, or which 
gives a greater account of the wars 
and  contentions  and  destructions  
of my people. And this have I done, 
and commanded my people what 
they  should  do  after  I  was  gone; 
and  that  these  plates  should  be 
handed down from one generation 
to another, or from one prophet to 
another,  until  further  command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And an account of my a making 
these plates shall be given hereafter;  
and then, behold, I proceed accord-

ing  to  that  which  I  have  spoken; 
and this I do that the more sacred 
things may be b kept for the knowl-
edge of my people.

6 Nevertheless, I do not a write any-
thing upon plates save it be that I 
think  it  be  b sacred.  And  now,  if  I 
do err, even did they err of old; not 
that I would excuse myself because 
of  other  men,  but  because  of  the 
c weakness which is in me, according 
to the flesh, I would excuse myself.
7 For the things which some men 
esteem to be of great worth, both 
to the body and soul, others set at 
a naught  and  trample  under  their 
feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel 
do men b trample under their feet; I 
say, trample under their feet but I 
would speak in other words—they 
set him at naught, and c hearken not 
to the voice of his counsels.
