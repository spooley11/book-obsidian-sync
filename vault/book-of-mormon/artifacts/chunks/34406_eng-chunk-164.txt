Hosts soon cometh upon all nations, 
yea, upon every one; yea, upon the 
b proud and lofty, and upon every 
one who is lifted up, and he shall 
be brought low.

13 Yea,  and  the  day  of  the  Lord 
shall  come  upon  all  the  a cedars 
of Lebanon, for they are high and 
lifted up; and upon all the oaks of 
Bashan;

14 And upon all the a high moun-
tains,  and  upon  all  the  hills,  and 
upon all the nations which are lifted 
up, and upon every people;

15 And  upon  every  a high  tower,

and upon every fenced wall;

16 And upon all the ships of the a sea, 
and upon all the ships of Tarshish,  
and upon all pleasant pictures.
