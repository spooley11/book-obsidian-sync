20 And it came to pass in the days 
of Mosiah, there was a large a stone 
brought unto him with engravings 
on  it;  and  he  did  b interpret  the  
engravings by the gift and power 
of God.

21 And  they  gave  an  account  of 
one  a Coriantumr, and the slain of 
his  people.  And  Coriantumr  was 
discovered by the people of Zara-
hemla; and he dwelt with them for 
the space of nine moons.

22 It also spake a few words con-
cerning  his  fathers.  And  his  first 
parents came out from the a tower, 
at the time the Lord  b confounded 
the language of the people; and the 
severity of the Lord fell upon them 
according to his judgments, which 
are just; and their c bones lay scat-
tered in the land northward.

23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in 
the days of Mosiah; and I have lived 
to see his death; and a Benjamin, b his  
son, reigneth in his stead.

24 And behold, I have seen, in the 
days of king Benjamin, a serious war 
and much bloodshed between the 
Nephites  and  the  Lamanites.  But 
behold,  the  Nephites  did  obtain  
much  advantage  over  them;  yea, 
insomuch that king Benjamin did 
drive them out of the land of Zara-
hemla.

25 And it came to pass that I began  
to be old; and, having no seed, and 
knowing king a Benjamin to be a just 
man before the Lord, wherefore, I 
shall b deliver up c these plates unto 
him,  exhorting  all  men  to  come 
unto God, the Holy One of Israel, 
and believe in prophesying, and in 
revelations, and in the ministering 
of angels, and in the gift of speak-
ing with tongues, and in the gift of 
interpreting languages, and in all 
things which are d good; for there is 
nothing which is good save it comes 
from  the  Lord:  and  that  which  is 
evil cometh from the devil.

26 And now, my beloved brethren, 
I would that ye should a come unto 
Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel,  
and  partake  of  his  salvation,  and 
the power of his redemption. Yea, 
come  unto  him,  and  b offer  your 
whole souls as an c offering unto him,  
and continue in d fasting and pray-
ing, and endure to the end; and as 
the Lord liveth ye will be saved.
