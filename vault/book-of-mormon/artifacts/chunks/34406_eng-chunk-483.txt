16 And it came to pass that Am-
mon, being filled with the  a Spirit 
of God, therefore he perceived the 
b thoughts of the king. And he said 
unto  him:  Is  it  because  thou  hast 
heard that I defended thy servants 
and thy flocks, and slew c seven of 
their brethren with the sling and 
with the sword, and smote off the 
arms of others, in order to defend thy 
flocks and thy servants; behold, is  
it this that causeth thy marvelings?
17 I say unto you, what is it, that 
thy marvelings are so great? Behold, 
I am a  a man, and am thy servant; 
therefore, whatsoever thou desirest 
which is right, that will I do.

18 Now when the king had heard

ALMA 18  : 19–37

these  words,  he  marveled  again, 
for  he  beheld  that  Ammon  could 
a discern his thoughts; but notwith-
standing this, king Lamoni did open 
his mouth, and said unto him: Who 
art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, 
who b knows all things?

19 Ammon answered and said unto

him: I am not.

20 And the king said: How know-
est thou the thoughts of my heart? 
Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell 
me concerning these things; and also 
tell me by what power ye slew and 
smote off the arms of my brethren 
that scattered my flocks—

21 And now, a if thou wilt tell me 
concerning  these  things,  whatso-
ever thou desirest I will give unto 
thee; and if it were needed, I would 
guard thee with my armies; but I 
know that thou art more powerful 
than  all  they;  nevertheless,  what-
soever  thou  desirest  of  me  I  will 
grant it unto thee.

22 Now Ammon being  a wise, yet 
harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt 
thou hearken unto my words, if I 
tell thee by what power I do these 
things? And this is the thing that I 
desire of thee.
