me,  after  that  I  am  gone  to  the 
Father?

2 And they all spake, save it were 
three, saying: We desire that after 
we have lived unto the age of man, 
that  our  ministry,  wherein  thou 
hast  called  us,  may  have  an  end, 
that  we  may  speedily  come  unto 
thee in thy kingdom.

3 And he said unto them: Blessed 
are ye because ye desired this thing 
of me; therefore, after that ye are 
a seventy and two years old ye shall 
come unto me in my b kingdom; and 
with me ye shall find c rest.

4 And when he had spoken unto 
them, he turned himself unto the 
three,  and  said  unto  them:  What 
will ye that I should do unto you, 
when I am gone unto the Father?

5 And  they  sorrowed  in  their 
hearts, for they durst not speak unto 
him the thing which they desired.
6 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I a know your thoughts, and ye have 
desired the thing which b John, my 
beloved, who was with me in my 
ministry, before that I was lifted up 
by the Jews, desired of me.

7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, 
for ye shall a never taste of b death; 
but ye shall live to behold all the do-
ings of the Father unto the children  
of men, even until all things shall 
be fulfilled according to the will of 
the Father, when I shall come in my 
glory with the c powers of heaven.

8 And ye shall never endure the 
pains  of  death;  but  when  I  shall 
come  in  my  glory  ye  shall  be 
changed in the twinkling of an eye 
from  a mortality  to  b immortality;

and then shall ye be blessed in the 
kingdom of my Father.

9 And again, ye shall not have pain 
while  ye  shall  dwell  in  the  flesh, 
neither  sorrow  save  it  be  for  the 
a sins of the world; and all this will 
I do because of the thing which ye 
have desired of me, for ye have de-
sired that ye might b bring the souls 
of men unto me, while the world 
shall stand.
