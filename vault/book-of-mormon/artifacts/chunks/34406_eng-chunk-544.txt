37 And  after  that  they  did  sepa-
rate themselves one from another, 
a taking no thought for themselves 
what they should eat, or what they 
should drink, or what they should  
put on.

38 And  the  Lord  provided  for 
them that they should hunger not, 
neither  should  they  thirst;  yea, 
and  he  also  gave  them  strength, 
that they should suffer no manner 
of  a afflictions,  save  it  were  swal-
lowed up in the joy of Christ. Now 
this was according to the prayer of 
Alma; and this because he prayed  
in b faith.

CHAPTER 32

Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions 
had humbled them—Faith is a hope in 
that which is not seen which is true—
Alma testifies that angels minister to 
men, women, and children—Alma com-
pares the word unto a seed—It must be 
planted and nourished—Then it grows 
into a tree from which the fruit of eter-
nal life is picked. About 74 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
go forth, and began to preach the 
word of God unto the people, enter-
ing into their synagogues, and into 
their houses; yea, and even they did 
preach the word in their streets.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
much labor among them, they be-
gan to have success among the a poor 
class  of  people;  for  behold,  they 
were  cast  out  of  the  synagogues 
because of the coarseness of their  
apparel—

3 Therefore they were not permit-
ted to enter into their synagogues 
to  worship  God,  being  esteemed 
as  filthiness;  therefore  they  were 
poor; yea, they were esteemed by 
their brethren as a dross; therefore 
they were b poor as to things of the 
world;  and  also  they  were  poor  
in heart.
