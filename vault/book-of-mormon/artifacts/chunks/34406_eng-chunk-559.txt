these  things,  and  that  ye  should 
a work out your salvation with fear 
before God, and that ye should no 
more deny the coming of Christ;

38 That  ye  a contend  no  more  
against the Holy Ghost, but that ye 
receive it, and take upon you the 
b name of Christ; that ye humble your-
selves even to the dust, and c worship 
God, in whatsoever place ye may be 
in, in spirit and in truth; and that 
ye live in  d thanksgiving daily, for  
the  many  e mercies  and  blessings 
which he doth bestow upon you.

39 Yea, and I also a exhort you, my 
brethren, that ye be b watchful unto 
prayer continually, that ye may not 
be  led  away  by  the  c temptations 
of the devil, that he may not over-
power you, that ye may not become 
his subjects at the last day; for be-
hold,  he  rewardeth  you  d no  good  
thing.

40 And now my beloved brethren, I 
would exhort you to have a patience, 
and that ye bear with all manner 
of b afflictions; that ye do not c revile 
against those who do cast you out 
because  of  your  d exceeding  pov-
erty,  lest  ye  become  sinners  like 
unto them;

41 But that ye have a patience, and 
bear with those b afflictions, with a 
firm hope that ye shall one day rest 
from all your afflictions.

CHAPTER 35

The  preaching  of  the  word  destroys 
the craft of the Zoramites—They expel 
the converts, who then join the people 
of Ammon in Jershon—Alma sorrows 
because of the wickedness of the people.

Amulek had made an end of these
