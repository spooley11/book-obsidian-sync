year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi;

8 And a this is the account of Am-
mon and his brethren, their jour-
neyings in the land of Nephi, their 
sufferings in the land, their sorrows, 
and their afflictions, and their b in-
comprehensible joy, and the recep-
tion and safety of the brethren in 
the land of Jershon. And now may 
the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, 
bless their souls forever.

9 And  this  is  the  account  of  the 
wars  and  contentions  among  the 
Nephites, and also the wars between 
the  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites;

11 And the bodies of many thou-
sands  are  laid  low  in  the  earth, 
while the bodies of many thousands
