CHAPTER 15

Alma  and  Amulek  go  to  Sidom  and 
establish a church—Alma heals Zeez-
rom, who joins the Church—Many are 
baptized,  and  the  Church  prospers—
Alma  and  Amulek  go  to  Zarahemla. 
About 81 b.c.

And it came to pass that Alma and 
Amulek were commanded to depart 
out of that city; and they departed, 
and came out even into the land of  
Sidom; and behold, there they found 
all the people who had departed out  
of the land of     a Ammonihah, who had  
been b cast out and stoned, because 
they believed in the words of Alma.
2 And they related unto them all 
that had happened unto their a wives 
and children, and also concerning 
themselves, and of their b power of 
deliverance.

3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Si-
dom, with a burning fever, which 
was caused by the great tribulations

edness, for he supposed that Alma 
and Amulek were no more; and he 
supposed that they had been slain 
because  of  his  iniquity.  And  this 
great sin, and his many other sins, 
did harrow up his mind until it did 
become exceedingly sore, having no 
deliverance; therefore he began to 
be scorched with a burning heat.

4 Now, when he heard that Alma 
and Amulek were in the land of Si-
dom, his heart began to take courage;  
and he sent a message immediately 
unto them, desiring them to come 
unto him.
