5 But  behold,  my  sons  and  my 
daughters, I cannot go down to my 
grave save I should leave a a blessing 
upon you; for behold, I know that 
if ye are b brought up in the c way ye 
should go ye will not depart from it.
6 Wherefore,  if  ye  are  a cursed, 
behold,  I  leave  my  blessing  upon 
you, that the b cursing may be taken 
from  you  and  be  answered  upon 
the c heads of your parents.

7 Wherefore, because of my bless-
ing  the  Lord  God  will  a not  suffer 
that ye shall perish; wherefore, he 
will be b merciful unto you and unto 
your seed forever.

8 And it came to pass that after my 
father had made an end of speaking 
to the sons and daughters of Laman, 
he caused the sons and daughters of 
Lemuel to be brought before him.
9 And he spake unto them, saying:

2 NEPHI 4  : 10–23

Behold, my sons and my daughters, 
who are the sons and the daughters 
of  my  second  son;  behold  I  leave 
unto you the same blessing which 
I left unto the sons and daughters 
of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not 
utterly be destroyed; but in the end 
thy seed shall be blessed.

10 And it came to pass that when 
my father had made an end of speak-
ing  unto  them,  behold,  he  spake 
unto the sons of a Ishmael, yea, and 
even all his household.
