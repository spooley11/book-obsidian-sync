plead with my brethren, insomuch 
that  they  did  soften  their  hearts;

20 And it came to pass that they 
were  sorrowful,  because  of  their

21 And it came to pass that I did 
frankly a forgive them all that they 
had  done,  and  I  did  exhort  them 
that they would pray unto the Lord 
their God for  b forgiveness. And it 
came to pass that they did so. And

father.
