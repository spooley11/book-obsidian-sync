ALMA 22  : 18–27

prostrate himself upon the earth, 
and cried b mightily, saying:

18 O God, Aaron hath told me that 
there is a God; and if there is a God, 
and if thou art God, wilt thou make 
thyself known unto me, and I will 
give away all my sins to know thee, 
and that I may be raised from the 
dead, and be saved at the last day. 
And now when the king had said 
these words, he was struck a as if he 
were dead.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
servants ran and told the queen all 
that had happened unto the king. 
And she came in unto the king; and  
when she saw him lay as if he were 
dead, and also Aaron and his breth-
ren  standing  as  though  they  had 
been the cause of his fall, she was 
angry with them, and commanded 
that  her  servants,  or  the  servants 
of the king, should take them and 
slay them.

20 Now the servants had seen the 
cause  of  the  king’s  fall,  therefore 
they durst not lay their hands on 
Aaron and his brethren; and they 
pled with the queen saying: Why 
commandest thou that we should 
slay these men, when behold one 
of  them  is  a mightier  than  us  all? 
Therefore we shall fall before them.
21 Now when the queen saw the 
fear  of  the  servants  she  also  be-
gan to fear exceedingly, lest there 
should  some  evil  come  upon  her. 
And she commanded her servants 
that  they  should  go  and  call  the 
people, that they might slay Aaron 
and his brethren.

22 Now when Aaron saw the de-
termination of the queen, he, also 
knowing the hardness of the hearts 
of  the  people,  feared  lest  that  a 
multitude should assemble them-
selves  together,  and  there  should 
be a great contention and a distur-
bance  among  them;  therefore  he

put forth his a hand and raised the 
king from the earth, and said unto 
him: Stand. And he stood upon his 
feet, receiving his strength.
