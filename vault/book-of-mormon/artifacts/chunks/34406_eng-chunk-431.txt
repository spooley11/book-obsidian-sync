of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

3 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the tenth year of the 
reign of the judges over the people 
of Nephi, that Alma departed from 
thence  and  took  his  journey  over 
into the land of a Melek, on the west 
of the b river Sidon, on the west by 
the borders of the wilderness.

4 And he began to teach the peo-
ple in the land of Melek according 
to the a holy order of God, by which 
he had been called; and he began 
to teach the people throughout all 
the land of Melek.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the  
people came to him throughout all

ALMA 8  : 6–19

the borders of the land which was by 
the wilderness side. And they were 
baptized throughout all the land;

6 So that when he had finished his 
work at Melek he departed thence, 
and traveled three days’ journey on 
the north of the land of Melek; and 
he came to a city which was called 
a Ammonihah.

7 Now  it  was  the  custom  of  the  
people of Nephi to call their lands, 
and their cities, and their villages, 
yea, even all their small villages, af-
ter the a name of him who first pos-
sessed them; and thus it was with  
the land of Ammonihah.

8 And it came to pass that when 
Alma had come to the city of Am-
monihah  he  began  to  preach  the 
word of God unto them.

9 Now Satan had gotten great a hold 
upon the hearts of the people of the  
city of Ammonihah; therefore they 
would not hearken unto the words 
of Alma.
