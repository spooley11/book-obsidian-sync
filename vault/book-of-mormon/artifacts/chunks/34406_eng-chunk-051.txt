again, saying: Thus shall be the de-
struction of all nations, kindreds, 
tongues,  and  people,  that  shall 
fight  against  the  twelve  apostles 
of the Lamb.

CHAPTER 12
Nephi sees in vision the land of promise; 
the righteousness, iniquity, and down-
fall  of  its  inhabitants;  the  coming  of 
the Lamb of God among them; how the 
Twelve Disciples and the Twelve Apos-
tles will judge Israel; and the loathsome 
and filthy state of those who dwindle 
in unbelief. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that the angel 
said  unto  me:  Look,  and  behold 
thy seed, and also the seed of thy 
brethren. And I looked and beheld 
the a land of promise; and I beheld 
multitudes of people, yea, even as 
it were in number as many as the 
b sand of the sea.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld 
multitudes  gathered  together  to 
battle, one against the other; and I 
beheld a wars, and rumors of wars, 
and great slaughters with the sword 
among my people.
