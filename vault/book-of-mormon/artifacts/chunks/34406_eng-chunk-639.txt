10 And Moroni also sent unto him, 
desiring him that he would be a faith-
ful in maintaining that quarter of 
the  land,  and  that  he  would  seek 
every  opportunity  to  scourge  the 
Lamanites in that quarter, as much 
as was in his power, that perhaps he 
might take again by stratagem or 
some other way those cities which 
had been taken out of their hands; 
and that he also would fortify and 
strengthen the cities round about, 
which had not fallen into the hands 
of the Lamanites.

11 And  he  also  said  unto  him,  I 
would come unto you, but behold, 
the Lamanites are upon us in the 
borders  of  the  land  by  the  west 
sea; and behold, I go against them, 
therefore I cannot come unto you.
12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had 
a departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, and had made known unto 
the queen concerning the death of  
his brother, and had gathered to-
gether a large number of men, and  
had marched forth against the Neph-
ites on the borders by the west sea.
13 And thus he was endeavoring 
to harass the Nephites, and to draw 
away a part of their forces to that 
part of the land, while he had com-
manded  those  whom  he  had  left 
to possess the cities which he had 
taken, that they should also harass 
the Nephites on the borders by the 
east sea, and should take possession 
of their lands as much as it was in 
their power, according to the power 
of their armies.

14 And thus were the Nephites in 
those dangerous circumstances in 
the ending of the twenty and sixth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

15 But behold, it came to pass in 
the twenty and seventh year of the 
reign of the judges, that Teancum, 
by the command of Moroni—who 
had established armies to protect 
the south and the west borders of 
the land, and had begun his march

towards  the  land  Bountiful,  that 
he might assist Teancum with his 
men  in  retaking  the  cities  which 
they had lost—

16 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum had received orders to make 
an attack upon the city of Mulek, 
and retake it if it were possible.
