28 And  I  beheld  that  he  went 
forth ministering unto the people, 
in a power and great glory; and the 
multitudes were gathered together 
to hear him; and I beheld that they 
cast him out from among them.

29 And I also beheld a twelve oth-
ers following him. And it came to 
pass that they were b carried away 
in the Spirit from before my face, 
and I saw them not.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel spake unto me again, saying: 
Look! And I looked, and I beheld 
the heavens open again, and I saw 
a angels descending upon the chil-
dren of men; and they did minister 
unto them.

31 And he spake unto me again, 
saying: Look! And I looked, and I 
beheld the Lamb of God going forth 
among the children of men. And I 
beheld  multitudes  of  people  who

were a sick, and who were afflicted 
with  all  manner  of  diseases,  and 
with  b devils  and  c unclean  spirits; 
and  the  angel  spake  and  showed 
all these things unto me. And they 
were  d healed by the power of the 
Lamb  of  God;  and  the  devils  and 
the unclean spirits were cast out.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel spake unto me again, saying: 
Look! And I looked and beheld the 
Lamb  of  God,  that  he  was  a taken 
by the people; yea, the Son of the 
everlasting God was b judged of the 
world; and I saw and bear record.

33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was 
a lifted up upon the cross and b slain 
for the sins of the world.

34 And after he was slain I saw the 
multitudes of the earth, that they 
were  gathered  together  to  a fight 
against  the  apostles  of  the  Lamb; 
for thus were the twelve called by 
the angel of the Lord.

35 And the multitude of the earth 
was  gathered  together;  and  I  be-
held that they were in a large and 
spacious  a building,  like  unto  the 
building which my father saw. And 
the  angel  of  the  Lord  spake  unto 
me again, saying: Behold the world 
and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold 
the house of Israel hath gathered 
together to b fight against the twelve 
apostles of the Lamb.
