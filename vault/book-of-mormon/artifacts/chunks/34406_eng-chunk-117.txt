of time he cometh to bring salvation  
unto men.

4 And  thou  hast  a beheld  in  thy 
youth  his  glory;  wherefore,  thou 
art blessed even as they unto whom 
he shall minister in the flesh; for 
the  Spirit  is  the  same,  yesterday, 
today, and forever. And the way is 
prepared from the fall of man, and 
b salvation is c free.

5 And  men  are  instructed  suffi-
ciently that they a know good from 
evil. And the b law is given unto men. 
And by the law no flesh is  c justi-
fied; or, by the law men are d cut off. 
Yea, by the temporal law they were 
cut  off;  and  also,  by  the  spiritual 
law  they  perish  from  that  which 
is  good,  and  become  miserable

a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends 
of the law, unto all those who have 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit; 
and unto b none else can the c ends 
of the law be answered.

8 Wherefore, how great the impor-
tance to make these things known 
unto the inhabitants of the earth, 
that  they  may  know  that  there 
is  no  flesh  that  can  dwell  in  the
