CHAPTER 8
Ammon teaches the people of Limhi—
He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite 
plates—Ancient records can be trans-
lated by seers—No gift is greater than 
seership. About 121 b.c.
And it came to pass that after king 
Limhi had made an end of a speak-
ing to his people, for he spake many 
things unto them and only a few of 
them have I written in this book, he 
told his people all the things con-
cerning  their  brethren  who  were 
in the land of Zarahemla.

2 And  he  caused  that  Ammon 
should stand up before the multi-
tude,  and  rehearse  unto  them  all  
that had happened unto their breth-
ren from the time that a Zeniff went 
up out of the land even until the 
time that he b himself came up out 
of the land.

3 And he also rehearsed unto them 
the last words which king Benjamin 
had  a taught  them,  and  explained 
them to the people of king Limhi, 
so that they might understand all 
the words which he spake.

4 And it came to pass that after he 
had done all this, that king Limhi 
dismissed the multitude, and caused 
that they should return every one 
unto his own house.
