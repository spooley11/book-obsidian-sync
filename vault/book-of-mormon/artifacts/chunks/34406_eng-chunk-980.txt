30 Farewell, my son, until I shall 
write unto you, or shall meet you 
again. Amen.

The  second  epistle  of  Mormon  to 
his son Moroni.

Comprising chapter 9.

CHAPTER 9

Both the Nephites and the Lamanites 
are depraved and degenerate—They tor-
ture and murder each other—Mormon

prays that grace and goodness may rest 
upon Moroni forever. About a.d. 401.

My  beloved  son,  I  write  unto  you 
again that ye may know that I am 
yet alive; but I write somewhat of 
that which is grievous.

2 For behold, I have had a sore bat-
tle with the Lamanites, in which we 
did not conquer; and Archeantus has 
fallen by the sword, and also Luram 
and Emron; yea, and we have lost  
a great number of our choice men.
3 And now behold, my son, I fear 
lest the Lamanites shall destroy this 
people; for they do not repent, and 
Satan stirreth them up continually 
to a anger one with another.

4 Behold, I am laboring with them 
continually; and when I speak the  
word of God with a sharpness they 
tremble and anger against me; and  
when I use no sharpness they b har-
den their hearts against it; where-
fore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord 
hath ceased c striving with them.

5 For so exceedingly do they anger 
that it seemeth me that they have 
no fear of death; and they have lost 
their love, one towards another; and 
they a thirst after blood and revenge 
continually.

6 And now, my beloved son, not-
withstanding their hardness, let us 
labor  a diligently; for if we should 
cease to b labor, we should be brought 
under condemnation; for we have a 
labor to perform whilst in this taber-
nacle of clay, that we may conquer 
the enemy of all righteousness, and 
rest our souls in the kingdom of God.
7 And now I write somewhat con-
cerning the sufferings of this people.
