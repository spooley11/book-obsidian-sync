4 For it were not possible that our 
father, Lehi, could have remembered 
all these things, to have taught them 
to his children, except it were for the 
help of these plates; for he having 
been taught in the a language of the 
Egyptians therefore he could read 
these engravings, and teach them to 
his children, that thereby they could 
teach  them  to  their  children,  and 
so fulfilling the commandments of 
God, even down to this present time.
5 I  say  unto  you,  my  sons,  a were 
it not for these things, which have 
been  kept  and  b preserved  by  the 
hand of God, that we might c read and 
understand of his  d mysteries, and 
have  his  e commandments  always

before  our  eyes,  that  even  our 
fathers  would  have  dwindled  in 
unbelief, and we should have been 
like unto our brethren, the Laman-
ites, who know nothing concerning 
these things, or even do not believe 
them when they are taught them, 
because of the  f traditions of their 
fathers, which are not correct.

6 O my sons, I would that ye should 
remember  that  these  sayings  are 
true,  and  also  that  these  records  
are a true. And behold, also the plates 
of Nephi, which contain the records 
and the sayings of our fathers from 
the time they left Jerusalem until 
now, and they are true; and we can 
know  of  their  surety  because  we 
have them before our eyes.
