14 And  as  many  as  would  hear 
their  words,  unto  them  they  did 
impart  the  word  of  God,  without 
any a respect of persons, continually.
15 And thus did Alma and Amulek 
go forth, and also many more who 
had  been  chosen  for  the  work,  to 
preach the word throughout all the 
land. And the establishment of the 
church became general throughout

the  land,  in  all  the  region  round 
about, among all the people of the 
Nephites.

16 And there was  a no inequality 
among them; the Lord did pour out 
his Spirit on all the face of the land 
to prepare the minds of the children 
of men, or to prepare their b hearts 
to receive the word which should 
be taught among them at the time 
of his coming—

17 That they might not be hard-
ened  against  the  word,  that  they 
might not be unbelieving, and go on 
to destruction, but that they might 
receive the word with joy, and as 
a a branch be grafted into the true 
vine, that they might enter into the 
b rest of the Lord their God.

18 Now those a priests who did go 
forth among the people did preach 
against all b lyings, and c deceivings, 
and  d envyings,  and  e strifes,  and 
malice, and revilings, and stealing, 
robbing,  plundering,  murdering, 
committing adultery, and all man-
ner  of  lasciviousness,  crying  that 
these things ought not so to be—

19 Holding  forth  things  which 
must  shortly  come;  yea,  holding 
forth the a coming of the Son of God, 
his sufferings and death, and also 
the resurrection of the dead.

20 And many of the people did in-
quire concerning the place where 
the Son of God should come; and 
they  were  taught  that  he  would 
a appear  unto  them  b after  his  res-
urrection; and this the people did 
hear with great joy and gladness.

21 And now after the church had 
been established throughout all the  
land—having got the a victory over
