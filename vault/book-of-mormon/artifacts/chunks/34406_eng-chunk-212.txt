5 And  they  a deny  the  b power  of 
God,  the  Holy  One  of  Israel;  and 
they say unto the people: Hearken 
unto us, and hear ye our precept; 
for behold there is c no God today, 
for the Lord and the Redeemer hath 
done his work, and he hath given 
his power unto men;

6 Behold,  hearken  ye  unto  my 
precept; if they shall say there is a 
miracle wrought by the hand of the 
Lord, believe it not; for this day he 
is not a God of a miracles; he hath 
done his work.

7 Yea,  and  there  shall  be  many 
which shall say: a Eat, drink, and be 
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it 
shall be well with us.

8 And  there  shall  also  be  many 
which shall say: a Eat, drink, and be 
b merry; nevertheless, fear God—he 
will c justify in committing a little 
d sin; yea, e lie a little, take the advan-
tage  of  one  because  of  his  words, 
dig a f pit for thy neighbor; there is 
g no harm in this; and do all these 
things, for tomorrow we die; and if 
it so be that we are guilty, God will 
beat us with a few stripes, and at 
last we shall be saved in the king-
dom of God.

9 Yea,  and  there  shall  be  many 
which shall teach after this manner, 
a false  and  vain  and  b foolish  c doc-
trines,  and  shall  be  puffed  up  in 
their hearts, and shall seek deep to 
hide their counsels from the Lord; 
and their works shall be in the dark.
10 And the a blood of the saints shall  
cry from the ground against them.
11 Yea, they have all gone out of the  
a way; they have become b corrupted.
12 Because of a pride, and because 
of  b false  teachers,  and  c false  doc-
trine, their churches have become 
corrupted, and their churches are 
lifted up; because of pride they are 
puffed up.

13 They a rob the b poor because of 
their fine sanctuaries; they rob the 
poor because of their fine clothing;
