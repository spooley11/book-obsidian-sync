28 For he hath answered the ends 
of the law, and he claimeth all those 
who have faith in him; and they who  
have faith in him will a cleave unto 
every good thing; wherefore he b ad-
vocateth the cause of the children 
of men; and he dwelleth eternally 
in the heavens.

29 And because he hath done this, 
my  beloved  brethren,  have  mira-
cles ceased? Behold I say unto you, 
Nay; neither have a angels ceased to 
minister unto the children of men.
30 For  behold,  they  are  subject 
unto him, to minister according to 
the word of his command, showing 
themselves  unto  them  of  strong

faith and a firm mind in every form 
of a godliness.

31 And the office of their minis-
try is to call men unto repentance, 
and to fulfil and to do the work of 
the covenants of the Father, which 
he hath made unto the children of 
men, to prepare the way among the 
children of men, by declaring the 
word  of  Christ  unto  the  a chosen 
vessels of the Lord, that they may 
bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God 
prepareth the way that the a residue 
of men may have  b faith in Christ, 
that the Holy Ghost may have place 
in  their  hearts,  according  to  the 
power thereof; and after this man-
ner bringeth to pass the Father, the 
covenants which he hath made unto 
the children of men.

33 And  Christ  hath  said:  a If  ye 
will have b faith in me ye shall have 
power  to  do  whatsoever  thing  is 
c expedient in me.

34 And he hath said:  a Repent all 
ye ends of the earth, and come unto 
me, and be baptized in my name, 
and have faith in me, that ye may 
be saved.

35 And now, my beloved brethren, 
if this be the case that these things 
are true which I have spoken unto 
you, and God will show unto you, 
with a power and great glory at the 
last b day, that they are true, and if 
they are true has the day of mira-
cles ceased?

36 Or have angels ceased to appear 
unto the children of men? Or has 
he a withheld the power of the Holy 
Ghost  from  them?  Or  will  he,  so
