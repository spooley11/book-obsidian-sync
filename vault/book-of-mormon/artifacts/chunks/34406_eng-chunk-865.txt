6 Yea, a wo unto him that shall deny 
the revelations of the Lord, and that 
shall say the Lord no longer worketh 
by revelation, or by prophecy, or by 
b gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, 
or by the power of the Holy Ghost!
7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall 
say at that day, to get a gain, that there  
can be b no miracle wrought by Jesus 
Christ; for he that doeth this shall 
become c like unto the son of perdi-
tion, for whom there was no mercy, 
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer 
a hiss, nor b spurn, nor make game of 
the c Jews, nor any of the remnant 
of the house of Israel; for behold, 
the Lord remembereth his covenant 
unto  them,  and  he  will  do  unto 
them  according  to  that  which  he 
hath sworn.

9 Therefore ye need not suppose 
that ye can turn the right hand of 
the Lord unto the left, that he may 
not execute judgment unto the ful-

filling  of  the  covenant  which  he 
hath made unto the house of Israel.

CHAPTER 30

The latter-day Gentiles are commanded 
to repent, come unto Christ, and be num-
bered with the house of Israel. About 
a.d. 34–35.
Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear 
the words of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of  the  living  God,  which  he  hath 
a commanded me that I should speak 
concerning you, for, behold he com-
mandeth  me  that  I  should  write,  
saying:

2 Turn, all ye a Gentiles, from your 
wicked ways; and  b repent of your 
evil doings, of your c lyings and de-
ceivings, and of your whoredoms, 
and  of  your  secret  abominations, 
and  your  idolatries,  and  of  your 
d murders,  and  your  e priestcrafts, 
and your f envyings, and your strifes, 
and from all your wickedness and 
abominations, and come unto me, 
and be baptized in my name, that ye 
may receive a remission of your sins, 
and be filled with the Holy Ghost, 
that  ye  may  be  g numbered  with 
my people who are of the house of  
Israel.
