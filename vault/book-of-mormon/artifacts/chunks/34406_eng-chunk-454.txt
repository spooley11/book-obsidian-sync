17 Then  is  the  time  when  their 
torments shall be as a a lake of fire 
and  brimstone,  whose  flame  as-
cendeth up forever and ever; and 
then is the time that they shall be 
chained down to an everlasting de-
struction,  according  to  the  power 
and captivity of Satan, he having 
subjected them according to his will.
18 Then, I say unto you, they shall 
be as though there had been a no re-
demption made; for they cannot be 
redeemed according to God’s justice; 
and they cannot b die, seeing there 
is no more corruption.

19 Now it came to pass that when 
Alma had made an end of speaking 
these words, the people began to be 
more astonished;

20 But  there  was  one  Antionah, 
who was a chief ruler among them, 
came forth and said unto him: What 
is this that thou hast said, that man 
should rise from the dead and be 
changed  from  this  mortal  to  an 
a immortal state, that the soul can  
never die?

21 What does the scripture mean, 
which saith that God placed a cheru-
bim  and  a  flaming  sword  on  the  
east of the garden of b Eden, lest our 
first parents should enter and par-
take of the fruit of the tree of life, 
and live forever? And thus we see 
that there was no possible chance 
that they should live forever.

22 Now Alma said unto him: This

is the thing which I was about to 
explain.  Now  we  see  that  Adam 
did  a fall  by  the  partaking  of  the 
forbidden  b fruit, according to the 
word of God; and thus we see, that 
by his fall, all mankind became a 
c lost and fallen people.

23 And  now  behold,  I  say  unto 
you that if it had been possible for 
Adam to have a partaken of the fruit 
of the tree of life at that time, there 
would have been no death, and the 
word would have been void, mak-
ing God a liar, for he said: b If thou 
eat thou shalt surely die.
