33 But  notwithstanding  all  this, 
they did impart much consolation 
to  the  church,  confirming  their 
faith, and exhorting them with long- 
suffering and much travail to keep  
the commandments of God.

34 And four of them were the a sons 
of  Mosiah;  and  their  names  were 
Ammon,  and  Aaron,  and  Omner, 
and Himni; these were the names 
of the sons of Mosiah.

35 And  they  traveled  through-
out all the land of Zarahemla, and 
among  all  the  a people  who  were 
under  the  reign  of  king  Mosiah, 
b zealously striving to repair all the 
injuries which they had done to the 
church,  c confessing  all  their  sins, 
and publishing all the things which 
they had seen, and explaining the 
prophecies and the scriptures to all 
who desired to hear them.

36 And  thus  they  were  instru-
ments in the hands of God in bring-
ing many to the knowledge of the 
truth, yea, to the knowledge of their  
Redeemer.

37 And how blessed are they! For 
they did a publish b peace; they did 
publish good tidings of good; and 
they  did  declare  unto  the  people 
that the Lord reigneth.

The sons of Mosiah go to preach to the 
Lamanites—Using the two seer stones, 
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates. 
About 92 b.c.
Now it came to pass that after the 
a sons of Mosiah had done all these 
things, they took a small number 
with  them  and  returned  to  their 
father,  the  king,  and  desired  of 
him that he would grant unto them
