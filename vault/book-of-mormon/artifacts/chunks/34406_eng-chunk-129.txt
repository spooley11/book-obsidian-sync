11 And after he had made an end  
of  speaking  unto  them,  he  spake 
unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, 
and  thy  a seed;  for  thou  shalt  in-
herit the land like unto thy brother 
Nephi. And thy seed shall be num-
bered with his seed; and thou shalt 
be even like unto thy brother, and 
thy  seed  like  unto  his  seed;  and 
thou  shalt  be  blessed  in  all  thy  
days.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father, Lehi, had  a spoken unto all 
his  household,  according  to  the 
feelings of his heart and the Spirit 
of the Lord which was in him, he 
waxed b old. And it came to pass that 
he died, and was buried.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days after his death, Laman 
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael 
were a angry with me because of the 
admonitions of the Lord.

14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to 
speak unto them, according to his 
word; for I had spoken many things 
unto them, and also my father, be-
fore his death; many of which say-
ings are written upon mine a other

plates; for a more history part are 
written upon mine other plates.

15 And  upon  a these  I  b write  the 
things  of  my  soul,  and  many  of 
the scriptures which are engraven 
upon  the  plates  of  brass.  For  my 
soul  c delighteth  in  the  scriptures, 
and my heart d pondereth them, and 
writeth them for the e learning and 
the profit of my children.

16 Behold,  my  a soul  delighteth 
in the things of the Lord; and my 
b heart pondereth continually upon 
the things which I have seen and  
heard.

17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding 
the great a goodness of the Lord, in 
showing me his great and marvel-
ous  works,  my  heart  exclaimeth: 
O  b wretched  man  that  I  am!  Yea, 
my heart c sorroweth because of my 
flesh; my soul grieveth because of 
mine iniquities.

18 I  am  encompassed  about,  be-
cause  of  the  temptations  and  the 
sins which do so easily a beset me.
19 And  when  I  desire  to  rejoice, 
my heart groaneth because of my 
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom 
I have a trusted.
