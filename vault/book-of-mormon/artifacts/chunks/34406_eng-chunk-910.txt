43 And there will I bless thee and 
thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy 
seed, and of the seed of thy brother, 
and  they  who  shall  go  with  thee, 
a great nation. And a there shall be 
none b greater than the nation which 
I will raise up unto me of thy seed, 
upon all the face of the earth. And

thus I will do unto thee because this 
long time ye have cried unto me.

CHAPTER 2

The  Jaredites  prepare  for  their  jour-
ney to a promised land—It is a choice 
land  whereon  men  must  serve  Christ 
or be swept off—The Lord talks to the 
brother of Jared for three hours—The 
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks 
the brother of Jared to propose how the 
barges will be lighted.
And it came to pass that Jared and 
his  brother,  and  their  families,  
and also the a friends of Jared and 
his brother and their families, went 
down  into  the  valley  which  was 
northward,  (and  the  name  of  the 
valley  was  b Nimrod,  being  called

c flocks which they had gathered to-
gether, male and female, of every  
kind.

2 And they did also lay snares and 
catch  a fowls  of  the  air;  and  they 
did also prepare a vessel, in which 
they did carry with them the fish 
of the waters.

3 And  they  did  also  carry  with 
them deseret, which, by interpreta-
tion, is a honey bee; and thus they 
did carry with them a swarms of bees, 
and all manner of that which was 
upon  the  face  of  the  land,  b seeds 
of every kind.

4 And it came to pass that when 
they had come down into the valley 
of Nimrod the Lord came down and 
talked with the brother of Jared; and 
he was in a a cloud, and the brother 
of Jared saw him not.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord 
commanded them that they should 
a go forth into the wilderness, yea,
