2 Behold,  we  have  not  come  out 
to battle against you that we might 
shed your blood for power; neither 
do  we  desire  to  bring  any  one  to 
the  a yoke  of  bondage.  But  this  is 
the b very cause for which ye have 
come against us; yea, and ye are an-
gry with us because of our religion.
3 But now, ye behold that the Lord 
is with us; and ye behold that he 
has delivered you into our hands. 
And  now  I  would  that  ye  should 
understand that this is done unto 
us  a because  of  our  religion  and 
our  faith  in  Christ.  And  now  ye

see  that  ye  cannot  destroy  this  
our faith.

4 Now ye see that this is the true 
faith of God; yea, ye see that God 
will support, and keep, and preserve 
us, so long as we are a faithful unto 
him,  and  unto  our  faith,  and  our 
religion;  and  never  will  the  Lord 
suffer  that  we  shall  be  destroyed 
except  we  should  fall  into  trans-
gression and deny our faith.

5 And  now,  Zerahemnah,  I  com-
mand  you,  in  the  name  of  that 
all-powerful God, who has strength-
ened our arms that we have gained 
power  over  you,  a by  our  faith,  by 
our  religion,  and  by  our  b rites  of 
worship, and by our church, and by 
the sacred support which we owe 
to our c wives and our children, by 
that d liberty which binds us to our 
lands and our country; yea, and also 
by the maintenance of the sacred 
word of God, to which we owe all 
our  happiness;  and  by  all  that  is 
most dear unto us—

6 Yea,  and  this  is  not  all;  I  com-
mand you by all the desires which 
ye have for life, that ye a deliver up 
your weapons of war unto us, and 
we will seek not your blood, but we  
will b spare your lives, if ye will go 
your  way  and  come  not  again  to 
war against us.
