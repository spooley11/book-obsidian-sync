6 Nevertheless,  I  did  harden  my 
heart, for I was a called many times 
and I would not b hear; therefore I 
knew concerning these things, yet  
I would not know; therefore I went 
on  rebelling  c against  God,  in  the 
wickedness of my heart, even un-
til  the  fourth  day  of  this  seventh 
month, which is in the tenth year 
of the reign of the judges.

7 As I was journeying to see a very 
near kindred, behold an a angel of  
the  Lord  appeared  unto  me  and 
said: Amulek, return to thine own 
house, for thou shalt feed a prophet 
of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is  
a  chosen  man  of  God;  for  he  has 
b fasted many days because of the  
sins of this people, and he is an hun-
gered, and thou shalt c receive him 
into thy house and feed him, and 
he shall bless thee and thy house;

and the blessing of the Lord shall 
rest upon thee and thy house.

8 And it came to pass that I obeyed 
the voice of the angel, and returned 
towards my house. And as I was go-
ing thither I found the a man whom 
the angel said unto me: Thou shalt 
receive into thy house—and behold 
it was this same man who has been 
speaking unto you concerning the 
things of God.

9 And the angel said unto me he is 
a a holy man; wherefore I know he 
is a holy man because it was said 
by an angel of God.

10 And  again,  I  know  that  the 
things  whereof  he  hath  testified  
are true; for behold I say unto you, 
that as the Lord liveth, even so has he 
sent his a angel to make these things 
manifest unto me; and this he has 
done while this Alma hath b dwelt  
at my house.

11 For  behold,  he  hath  a blessed 
mine  house,  he  hath  blessed  me, 
and my women, and my children, 
and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, 
even all my kindred hath he blessed, 
and the blessing of the Lord hath 
rested  upon  us  according  to  the  
words which he spake.
