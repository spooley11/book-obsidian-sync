16 And  I,  Nephi,  did  a build  a 
b temple; and I did construct it af-
ter  the  manner  of  the  temple  of 
c Solomon save it were not built of 
so many d precious things; for they 
were not to be found upon the land, 
wherefore, it could not be built like 
unto  Solomon’s  e temple.  But  the 
manner  of  the  construction  was 
like unto the temple of  f Solomon; 
and the workmanship thereof was 
exceedingly fine.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did cause my people to be 
a industrious, and to b labor with their  
c hands.

18 And it came to pass that they 
would that I should be their a king. 
But I, Nephi, was desirous that they 
should have no king; nevertheless, 
I  did  for  them  according  to  that 
which was in my power.

19 And behold, the words of the 
Lord  had  been  fulfilled  unto  my

brethren, which he spake concern-
ing  them,  that  I  should  be  their 
a ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, 
I  had  been  their  ruler  and  their 
b teacher, according to the command-
ments of the Lord, until the time 
they sought to take away my life.

20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord 
was fulfilled which he spake unto 
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they 
will  a not hearken unto thy words 
they shall be b cut off from the pres-
ence of the Lord. And behold, they 
were c cut off from his presence.

21 And he had caused the  a curs-
ing to come upon them, yea, even 
a sore cursing, because of their in-
iquity. For behold, they had hard-
ened their hearts against him, that 
they had become like unto a flint; 
wherefore, as they were white, and 
exceedingly fair and b delightsome, 
that  they  might  not  be  c enticing 
unto my people the Lord God did 
cause a d skin of e blackness to come 
upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I 
will cause that they shall be a loath-
some  unto  thy  people,  save  they 
shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And cursed shall be the seed of 
him that  a mixeth with their seed; 
for they shall be cursed even with 
the  same  cursing.  And  the  Lord 
spake it, and it was done.
