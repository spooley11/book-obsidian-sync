MOSIAH 23  : 22–38

to a chasten his people; yea, he tri-
eth their b patience and their faith.
22 Nevertheless—whosoever put-
teth his a trust in him the same shall 
be  b lifted  up  at  the  last  day.  Yea, 
and thus it was with this people.

23 For  behold,  I  will  show  unto 
you  that  they  were  brought  into 
a bondage, and none could deliver 
them but the Lord their God, yea, 
even the God of Abraham and Isaac 
and of Jacob.

24 And it came to pass that he did 
deliver them, and he did show forth 
his mighty power unto them, and 
great were their rejoicings.

25 For behold, it came to pass that 
while they were in the land of He-
lam, yea, in the city of Helam, while 
tilling the land round about, behold 
an  army  of  the  Lamanites  was  in 
the borders of the land.

26 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brethren of Alma fled from their 
fields,  and  gathered  themselves 
together in the city of Helam; and 
they were much frightened because 
of the appearance of the Lamanites.
27 But Alma went forth and stood 
among  them,  and  exhorted  them 
that they should not be frightened, 
but that they should remember the 
Lord  their  God  and  he  would  de-
liver them.

28 Therefore  they  hushed  their 
fears,  and  began  to  cry  unto  the 
Lord that he would soften the hearts 
of the Lamanites, that they would 
spare  them,  and  their  wives,  and 
their children.
