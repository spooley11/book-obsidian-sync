12 And now when Moroni had said 
these words, Zerahemnah retained 
his sword, and he was angry with 
Moroni,  and  he  rushed  forward 
that he might slay Moroni; but as 
he raised his sword, behold, one of 
Moroni’s soldiers smote it even to  
the earth, and it broke by the hilt; 
and he also smote Zerahemnah that 
he took off his scalp and it fell to 
the earth. And Zerahemnah with-
drew  from  before  them  into  the 
midst of his soldiers.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
soldier  who  stood  by,  who  smote 
off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took 
up the scalp from off the ground by

the hair, and laid it upon the point 
of his sword, and stretched it forth 
unto them, saying unto them with 
a loud voice:

14 Even  as  this  scalp  has  fallen 
to the earth, which is the scalp of 
your  chief,  so  shall  ye  fall  to  the 
earth except ye will deliver up your 
weapons of war and depart with a 
covenant of peace.

15 Now  there  were  many,  when 
they  heard  these  words  and  saw 
the  scalp  which  was  upon  the 
sword, that were struck with fear; 
and  many  came  forth  and  threw 
down  their  weapons  of  war  at 
the  feet  of  Moroni,  and  entered 
into a a covenant of peace. And as 
many  as  entered  into  a  covenant 
they  suffered  to  b depart  into  the  
wilderness.

16 Now it came to pass that Zera-
hemnah  was  exceedingly  wroth, 
and he did stir up the remainder 
of  his  soldiers  to  anger,  to  con-
tend more powerfully against the  
Nephites.

17 And  now  Moroni  was  angry, 
because  of  the  stubbornness  of 
the  Lamanites;  therefore  he  com-
manded his people that they should 
fall upon them and slay them. And 
it came to pass that they began to 
slay them; yea, and the Lamanites 
did contend with their swords and 
their might.

18 But behold, their naked skins 
and their bare heads were exposed 
to the sharp swords of the Nephites; 
yea, behold they were pierced and 
smitten, yea, and did fall exceed-
ingly fast before the swords of the 
Nephites;  and  they  began  to  be 
swept down, even as the soldier of 
Moroni had prophesied.
