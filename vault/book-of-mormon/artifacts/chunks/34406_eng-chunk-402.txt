And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  com-
mencement of the fifth year of their 
reign there began to be a contention  
among  the  people;  for  a  certain 
a man, being called Amlici, he being  
a  very  cunning  man,  yea,  a  wise 
man as to the wisdom of the world, 
he being after the order of the man 
that slew b Gideon by the sword, who 
was executed according to the law—
2 Now this Amlici had, by his cun-
ning,  a drawn  away  much  people 
after him; even so much that they 
began to be very powerful; and they 
began to endeavor to establish Am-
lici to be a king over the people.

3 Now  this  was  alarming  to  the 
people of the church, and also to all 
those who had not been drawn away 
after  the  persuasions  of  Amlici;  
for they knew that according to their 
law that such things must be estab-
lished by the a voice of the people.
4 Therefore,  if  it  were  possible 
that Amlici should gain the voice 
of the people, he, being a wicked 
man, would a deprive them of their 
rights and privileges of the church; 
for it was his intent to destroy the 
church of God.

5 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple assembled themselves together 
throughout all the land, every man 
according to his mind, whether it 
were for or against Amlici, in sepa-
rate bodies, having much dispute 
and  wonderful  a contentions  one 
with another.

6 And  thus  they  did  assemble 
themselves together to cast in their 
a voices concerning the matter; and 
they were laid before the judges.

8 Now  this  did  cause  much  joy 
in  the  hearts  of  those  who  were 
against him; but Amlici did stir up 
those who were in his favor to anger 
against those who were not in his  
favor.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
gathered themselves together, and 
did a consecrate Amlici to be their 
king.

10 Now  when  Amlici  was  made 
king  over  them  he  commanded 
them that they should take up arms 
against  their  brethren;  and  this 
he did that he might subject them  
to him.

11 Now the people of Amlici were 
distinguished by the name of Am-
lici, being called a Amlicites; and the 
remainder  were  b called  Nephites, 
or the people of God.
