12 Therefore  the  people  of  the 
Nephites were aware of the intent 
of the Amlicites, and therefore they  
did  prepare  to  meet  them;  yea,  
they did arm themselves with swords, 
and with cimeters, and with bows, and  
with arrows, and with stones, and 
with  slings,  and  with  all  manner  
of a weapons of war, of every kind.
13 And thus they were prepared 
to meet the Amlicites at the time 
of  their  coming.  And  there  were 
appointed  a captains,  and  higher 
captains,  and  chief  captains,  ac-
cording to their numbers.

14 And it came to pass that Amlici 
did arm his men with all manner of 
weapons of war of every kind; and 
he also appointed rulers and lead-
ers over his people, to lead them to 
war against their brethren.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the

Amlicites came upon the hill Am-
nihu, which was east of the a river 
Sidon,  which  ran  by  the  b land  of 
Zarahemla,  and  there  they  began 
to make war with the Nephites.

16 Now  Alma,  being  the  a chief 
judge and the b governor of the peo-
ple of Nephi, therefore he went up 
with his people, yea, with his cap-
tains,  and  chief  captains,  yea,  at 
the head of his armies, against the 
Amlicites to battle.

17 And they began to slay the Am-
licites upon the hill east of Sidon. 
And the Amlicites did contend with 
the  Nephites  with  great  strength, 
insomuch that many of the Neph-
ites did fall before the Amlicites.

18 Nevertheless  the  Lord  did 
strengthen the hand of the Nephites, 
that they slew the Amlicites with 
great slaughter, that they began to 
flee before them.
