27 And there were no more wars 
in the days of Shule; and he remem-
bered the great things that the Lord 
had done for his fathers in bringing 
them a across the great deep into the 
promised  land;  wherefore  he  did 
execute judgment in righteousness 
all his days.

CHAPTER 8
There is strife and contention over the 
kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound 
secret combination to slay the king—Se-
cret combinations are of the devil and 
result in the destruction of nations—
Modern  Gentiles  are  warned  against 
the  secret  combination  that  will  seek 
to overthrow the freedom of all lands, 
nations, and countries.

And it came to pass that he begat 
Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. 
And Omer begat Jared; and Jared  
begat sons and daughters.

2 And Jared rebelled against his 
father, and came and dwelt in the 
land of Heth. And it came to pass 
that he did a flatter many people, be-
cause of his cunning words, until he  
had gained the half of the kingdom.

3 And when he had gained the half 
of the kingdom he gave battle unto 
his father, and he did carry away 
his  father  into  captivity,  and  did 
make him serve in captivity;

4 And  now,  in  the  days  of  the 
reign of Omer he was in a captivity 
the half of his days. And it came to 
pass that he begat sons and daugh-
ters, among whom were Esrom and  
Coriantumr;

5 And they were exceedingly an-
gry because of the doings of Jared 
their brother, insomuch that they 
did raise an army and gave battle 
unto  Jared.  And  it  came  to  pass 
that they did give battle unto him  
by night.

6 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  slain  the  army  of  Jared 
they were about to slay him also; 
and  he  pled  with  them  that  they 
would not slay him, and he would 
give up the kingdom unto his father. 
And it came to pass that they did 
grant unto him his life.

7 And now Jared became exceed-
ingly a sorrowful because of the loss 
of the kingdom, for he had set his 
heart upon the kingdom and upon 
the glory of the world.
