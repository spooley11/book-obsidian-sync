15 Beware of a false prophets, who 
come to you in sheep’s clothing, but 
inwardly they are ravening wolves.
16 Ye  shall  know  them  by  their 
a fruits.  Do  men  gather  grapes  of 
thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every a good tree bring-
eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt 
tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth 
evil  fruit,  neither  a  corrupt  tree 
bring forth good fruit.

19 Every  tree  that  a bringeth  not 
forth good fruit is hewn down, and 
cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore, by their a fruits ye

shall know them.

21 Not every one that saith unto 
me,  Lord,  Lord,  shall  a enter  into 
the kingdom of heaven; but he that 
doeth the will of my Father who is 
in heaven.

22 Many will a say to me in that day: 
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
in thy name, and in thy name have 
cast  out  devils,  and  in  thy  name 
done many wonderful works?

23 And then will  a I profess unto 
them:  I  never  b knew  you;  c depart 
from me, ye that work iniquity.

24 Therefore, whoso heareth these 
sayings  of  mine  and  doeth  them,

I will liken him unto a wise man, 
who built his house upon a a rock—
25 And the a rain descended, and 
the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and  beat  upon  that  house;  and  it 
b fell not, for it was founded upon  
a rock.

26 And  every  one  that  heareth 
these  sayings  of  mine  and  doeth 
them  not  shall  be  likened  unto  a 
a foolish man, who built his house 
upon the b sand—

27 And  the  rain  descended,  and 
the  floods  came,  and  the  winds 
blew, and beat upon that house; and 
it fell, and great was the fall of it.
