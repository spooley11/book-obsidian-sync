14 And  they  discovered  a  a peo-
ple, who were called the people of 
Zarahemla.  Now,  there  was  great 
rejoicing among the people of Zar-
ahemla; and also Zarahemla did re-
joice exceedingly, because the Lord 
had sent the people of Mosiah with 
the b plates of brass which contained 
the record of the Jews.

15 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
Mosiah discovered that the people 
of a Zarahemla came out from Jeru-
salem at the time that  b Zedekiah, 
king  of  Judah,  was  carried  away 
captive into Babylon.

16 And they a journeyed in the wil-
derness, and were brought by the 
hand of the Lord across the great 
waters, into the land where Mosiah 
discovered them; and they had dwelt 
there from that time forth.

17 And  at  the  time  that  Mosiah 
discovered them, they had become 
exceedingly  numerous.  Neverthe-
less, they had had many wars and 
serious contentions, and had fallen 
by the sword from time to time; and

their  a language  had  become  cor-
rupted;  and  they  had  brought  no 
b records  with  them;  and  they  de-
nied the being of their Creator; and 
Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, 
could understand them.

18 But it came to pass that Mosiah 
caused that they should be taught 
in  his  a language.  And  it  came  to 
pass that after they were taught in 
the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla 
gave a genealogy of his fathers, ac-
cording  to  his  memory;  and  they 
are written, but b not in these plates.

appointed to be their king.
