his righteous people.

out in judgment against the Laman-
ites, when it is the a tradition of their 
fathers that has caused their hatred, 
yea, and it has been redoubled by 
those who have dissented from us, 
while your iniquity is for the cause 
of your love of glory and the vain 
things of the world?

33 Ye know that ye do transgress 
the laws of God, and ye do know that 
ye do trample them under your feet. 
Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If 
those whom ye have appointed your 
governors do not repent of their sins 
and  a iniquities, ye shall  b go up to  
battle against them.

34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am 
constrained, according to the cov-
enant which I have made to keep the 
commandments of my God; there-
fore I would that ye should adhere 
to the word of God, and send speed-
ily unto me of your provisions and  
of your men, and also to Helaman.
35 And behold, if ye will not do this 
I come unto you speedily; for behold, 
God will not suffer that we should 
perish  with  hunger;  therefore  he 
will  give  unto  us  of  your  food,  
even if it must be by the sword. Now 
see that ye fulfil the word of God.
36 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief 
captain. I a seek not for power, but to 
pull it down. I b seek not for honor 
of the world, but for the glory of 
my God, and the freedom and wel-
fare of my country. And thus I close 
mine epistle.
