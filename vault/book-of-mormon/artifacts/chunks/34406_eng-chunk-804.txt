and cried unto them, saying: d Blessed 
are ye if ye shall give heed unto the 
words of these twelve whom I have 
e chosen from among you to minis-
ter  unto  you,  and  to  be  your  ser-
vants; and unto them I have given 
power that they may baptize you 
with  water;  and  after  that  ye  are 
baptized with water, behold, I will 
baptize you with fire and with the 
Holy  Ghost;  therefore  blessed  are 
ye if ye shall believe in me and be 
baptized, after that ye have seen me  
and know that I am.

2 And again, more blessed are they 
who  shall  a believe  in  your  words 
because  that  ye  shall  testify  that 
ye have seen me, and that ye know 
that I am. Yea, blessed are they who 
shall  b believe in your  c words, and 
d come down into the depths of hu-
mility  and  be  baptized,  for  they 
shall be visited e with fire and with 
the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a 
remission of their sins.

3 Yea, blessed are the a poor in spirit 
who  b come  unto  me,  for  theirs  is 
the kingdom of heaven.

4 And again, blessed are all they that  
a mourn, for they shall be b comforted.
5 And blessed are the a meek, for

they shall inherit the b earth.

6 And  blessed  are  all  they  who 
do a hunger and b thirst after c righ-
teousness, for they shall be d filled 
with the Holy Ghost.

7 And  blessed  are  the  a merciful,

for they shall obtain mercy.

8 And blessed are all the a pure in

heart, for they shall b see God.

9 And blessed are all the a peace-
makers, for they shall be called the 
b children of God.

10 And blessed are all they who 
are a persecuted for my name’s sake, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 And blessed are ye when men 
shall a revile you and persecute, and 
shall say all manner of evil against 
you falsely, for my sake;

12 For a ye shall have great joy and 
be exceedingly glad, for great shall 
be your  b reward in heaven; for so 
c persecuted they the prophets who 
were before you.
