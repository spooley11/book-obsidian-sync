22 Wherefore, when thou hast read 
the words which I have commanded 
thee, and obtained the  a witnesses 
which I have promised unto thee, 
then  shalt  thou  seal  up  the  book 
again, and hide it up unto me, that 
I  may  preserve  the  words  which 
thou hast not read, until I shall see 
fit in mine own b wisdom to c reveal 
all things unto the children of men.
23 For behold, I am God; and I am 
a God of a miracles; and I will show

unto the b world that I am the same 
yesterday, today, and forever; and I 
c work not among the children of men  
save it be d according to their faith.
24 And again it shall come to pass 
that  the  Lord  shall  say  unto  him 
that shall read the words that shall 
be delivered him:

25 a Forasmuch as this people draw 
near  unto  me  with  their  mouth, 
and with their lips do  b honor me, 
but have removed their c hearts far 
from me, and their fear towards me 
is taught by the d precepts of men—
26 Therefore, I will proceed to do  
a  a marvelous  work  among  this  
people, yea, a b marvelous work and 
a wonder, for the c wisdom of their  
wise  and  d learned  shall  perish,  
and  the  e understanding  of  their 
f prudent shall be hid.
