things whatsoever did belong unto 
them.

2 And it came to pass that they had 
a not eaten up all their provisions; 
therefore they did take with them 
all that they had not devoured, of 
all their grain of every kind, and 
their gold, and their silver, and all 
their precious things, and they did 
return to their own lands and their 
possessions, both on the north and 
on the south, both on the land north-
ward and on the land southward.

3 And  they  granted  unto  those 
robbers  who  had  a entered  into  a 
covenant to keep the peace of the 
land, who were desirous to remain 
Lamanites, lands, according to their 
numbers, that they might have, with 
their labors, wherewith to subsist

the  judge,  b Lachoneus,  and  those 
who  had  been  appointed  leaders, 
who had established this great peace 
in the land.

7 And it came to pass that there 
were many cities built anew, and 
there were many old cities repaired.
8 And there were many a highways 
cast  up,  and  many  roads  made, 
which  led  from  city  to  city,  and 
from land to land, and from place 
to place.

9 And thus passed away the twenty 
and eighth year, and the people had 
continual peace.

10 But it came to pass in the twenty 
and ninth year there began to be 
some disputings among the people; 
and some were lifted up unto pride 
and a boastings because of their ex-
ceedingly  great  riches,  yea,  even 
unto great persecutions;
