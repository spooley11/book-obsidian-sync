3 NEPHI 17  : 10–25

10 And they did all, both they who 
had been healed and they who were 
whole, bow down at his feet, and 
did worship him; and as many as 
could come for the multitude did 
a kiss his feet, insomuch that they 
did bathe his feet with their tears.
11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
commanded that their a little chil-
dren should be brought.

12 So  they  brought  their  little 
children and set them down upon 
the ground round about him, and 
Jesus  stood  in  the  midst;  and  the 
multitude  gave  way  till  they  had 
all been brought unto him.

13 And it came to pass that when 
they had all been brought, and Jesus 
stood in the midst, he commanded 
the  multitude  that  they  should 
a kneel down upon the ground.

14 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  knelt  upon  the  ground, 
Jesus groaned within himself, and 
said: Father, I am a troubled because 
of the wickedness of the people of 
the house of Israel.

15 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, he himself also a knelt upon 
the  earth;  and  behold  he  b prayed 
unto  the  Father,  and  the  things 
which he prayed cannot be written, 
and the multitude did bear record 
who heard him.

16 And after this manner do they 
bear  record:  The  a eye  hath  never 
seen,  neither  hath  the  ear  heard, 
before,  so  great  and  marvelous 
things as we saw and heard Jesus 
speak unto the Father;
