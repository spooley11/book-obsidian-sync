24 And behold, the things which 
this a apostle of the Lamb shall write 
are  many  things  which  thou  hast 
seen;  and  behold,  the  remainder 
shalt thou see.

25 But the things which thou shalt 
see hereafter thou shalt not write; 
for the Lord God hath ordained the 
apostle of the Lamb of God that he 
should a write them.

26 And also others who have been, 
to them hath he shown all things, 
and they have a written them; and 
they are b sealed up to come forth in  
their purity, according to the truth 
which is in the Lamb, in the own 
due time of the Lord, unto the house 
of Israel.

27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear 
record, that the name of the apostle 
of the Lamb was a John, according 
to the word of the angel.

28 And behold, I, Nephi, am for-
bidden that I should write the re-
mainder of the things which I saw 
and  heard;  wherefore  the  things 
which I have written sufficeth me; 
and I have written but a small part 
of the things which I saw.

29 And  I  bear  record  that  I  saw 
the  things  which  my  a father  saw, 
and the angel of the Lord did make 
them known unto me.

30 And  now  I  make  an  end  of 
speaking  concerning  the  things 
which  I  saw  while  I  was  a carried 
away  in  the  Spirit;  and  if  all  the 
things which I saw are not written, 
the things which I have written are 
b true. And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 15

Lehi’s seed are to receive the gospel from  
the  Gentiles  in  the  latter  days—The 
gathering of Israel is likened unto an

olive tree whose natural branches will be 
grafted in again—Nephi interprets the 
vision of the tree of life and speaks of 
the justice of God in dividing the wicked 
from the righteous. About 600–592 b.c.

And  it  came  to  pass  that  after  I, 
Nephi,  had  been  carried  away  in 
the Spirit, and seen all these things, 
I returned to the tent of my father.
2 And it came to pass that I beheld 
my brethren, and they were disput-
ing  one  with  another  concerning 
the  things  which  my  father  had 
spoken unto them.
