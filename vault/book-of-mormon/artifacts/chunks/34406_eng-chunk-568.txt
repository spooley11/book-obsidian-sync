ALMA 37  : 9–21

their  God  unto  the  salvation  of 
their souls.

9 Yea, I say unto you, a were it not 
for these things that these records do 
contain, which are on these plates, 
Ammon and his brethren could not 
have b convinced so many thousands 
of  the  Lamanites  of  the  incorrect 
tradition of their fathers; yea, these 
records  and  their  c words  brought 
them unto repentance; that is, they 
brought them to the knowledge of 
the Lord their God, and to rejoice 
in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.

10 And  who  knoweth  but  what 
they will be the a means of bringing 
many thousands of them, yea, and 
also many thousands of our b stiff-
necked brethren, the Nephites, who 
are now hardening their hearts in 
sin and iniquities, to the knowledge 
of their Redeemer?

11 Now these mysteries are not yet 
fully made known unto me; there-
fore I shall forbear.

12 And  it  may  suffice  if  I  only 
say they are preserved for a a wise 
purpose, which purpose is known 
unto God; for he doth  b counsel in 
wisdom over all his works, and his 
paths are straight, and his course 
is c one eternal round.
