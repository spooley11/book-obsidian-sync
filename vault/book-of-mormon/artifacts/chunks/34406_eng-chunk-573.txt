according  to  their  a faith  in  God; 
therefore, if they had faith to be-
lieve  that  God  could  cause  that 
those  spindles  should  point  the 
way they should go, behold, it was 
done; therefore they had this mira-
cle, and also many other miracles 
wrought by the power of God, day

41 Nevertheless,  because  those 
miracles  were  worked  by  a small 
means it did show unto them mar-
velous works. They were b slothful, 
and  forgot  to  exercise  their  faith 
and diligence and then those mar-

not progress in their journey;

wilderness, or did a not travel a di-
rect course, and were afflicted with 
hunger and thirst, because of their 
transgressions.

43 And now, my son, I would that 
ye  should  understand  that  these 
things are not without a a shadow;

these  things  were  temporal)  they

heed to the a word of Christ, which 
will point to you a straight course to

to give heed to this compass, which 
would point unto them a straight
