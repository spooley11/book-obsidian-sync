21 And  as  concerning  that  God 
whom ye say we have rejected, be-
hold, we a know not such a being; nei-
ther do ye; but if it so be that there 
is such a being, we know not but  
that he hath made us as well as you.
22 And if it so be that there is a 
devil and a hell, behold will he not 
send  you  there  to  dwell  with  my 
brother whom ye have murdered, 
whom ye have hinted that he hath 
gone  to such  a place? But  behold 
these things matter not.

23 I  am  Ammoron,  and  a  de-
scendant  of  a Zoram,  whom  your 
fathers pressed and brought out of  
Jerusalem.

24 And behold now, I am a bold 
Lamanite;  behold,  this  war  hath 
been waged to avenge their wrongs, 
and a to maintain and to obtain their 
rights to the government; and I close 
my epistle to Moroni.

to become drunk, and the Nephite pris-
oners are freed—The city of Gid is taken 
without bloodshed. About 63–62 b.c.

Now it came to pass that when Mo-
roni had received this epistle he was 
more angry, because he knew that 
Ammoron had a perfect knowledge 
of his a fraud; yea, he knew that Am-
moron knew that it was not a just 
cause that had caused him to wage 
a war against the people of Nephi.
2 And he said: Behold, I will not 
exchange prisoners with Ammoron 
save he will withdraw his a purpose, 
as I have stated in my epistle; for 
I will not grant unto him that he 
shall  have  any  more  power  than 
what he hath got.
