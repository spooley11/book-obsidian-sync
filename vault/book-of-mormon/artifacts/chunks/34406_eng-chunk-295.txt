152

children of men, and shall dwell in 
a e tabernacle of clay, and shall go 
forth amongst men, working mighty 
f miracles, such as healing the sick, 
raising the dead, causing the lame 
to walk, the g blind to receive their 
sight, and the deaf to hear, and cur-
ing all manner of diseases.

6 And he shall cast out a devils, or 
the b evil spirits which dwell in the 
hearts of the children of men.

7 And lo, he shall  a suffer  b temp-
tations, and pain of body, c hunger, 
thirst, and fatigue, even more than 
man can d suffer, except it be unto 
death;  for  behold,  e blood  cometh 
from every pore, so great shall be 
his f anguish for the wickedness and 
the abominations of his people.

8 And  he  shall  be  called  a Jesus 
b Christ, the c Son of God, the d Father 
of heaven and earth, the e Creator of 
all things from the beginning; and 
his f mother shall be called Mary.

9 And lo, he cometh unto his own, 
that  a salvation  might  come  unto 
the children of men even through 
b faith on his name; and even after 
all this they shall consider him a 
man, and say that he hath a c devil,

and shall  d scourge him, and shall  
e crucify him.

10 And  he  shall  a rise  the  b third 
day from the dead; and behold, he 
standeth to  c judge the world; and 
behold,  all  these  things  are  done 
that  a  righteous  judgment  might 
come upon the children of men.
