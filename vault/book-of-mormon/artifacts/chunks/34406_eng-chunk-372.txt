14 And I will also ease the  a bur-
dens  which  are  put  upon  your 
shoulders, that even you cannot feel 
them upon your backs, even while 
you are in bondage; and this will I 
do that ye may stand as b witnesses 
for me hereafter, and that ye may 
know  of  a  surety  that  I,  the  Lord 
God,  do  visit  my  people  in  their  
c afflictions.

15 And now it came to pass that 
the burdens which were laid upon 
Alma and his brethren were made 
light; yea, the Lord did a strengthen 
them that they could bear up their 
b burdens  with  ease,  and  they  did 
submit  cheerfully  and  with  c pa-
tience to all the will of the Lord.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  so 
great was their faith and their pa-
tience  that  the  voice  of  the  Lord 
came unto them again, saying: Be 
of good comfort, for on the morrow 
I will deliver you out of bondage.

17 And he said unto Alma: Thou 
shalt  go  before  this  people,  and  I 
will go a with thee and deliver this 
people out of b bondage.

18 Now it came to pass that Alma 
and  his  people  in  the  night-time 
gathered their flocks together, and 
also of their grain; yea, even all the 
night-time were they gathering their 
flocks together.

19 And in the morning the Lord 
caused a a deep sleep to come upon 
the  Lamanites,  yea,  and  all  their 
task-masters  were  in  a  profound  
sleep.

20 And Alma and his people de-
parted  into  the  wilderness;  and 
when  they  had  traveled  all  day 
they pitched their tents in a valley,

and  they  called  the  valley  Alma, 
because  he  led  their  way  in  the  
wilderness.

21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma 
they  poured  out  their  a thanks  to 
God because he had been merciful 
unto  them,  and  eased  their  b bur-
dens, and had delivered them out 
of bondage; for they were in bond-
age, and none could deliver them 
except it were the Lord their God.
22 And they gave a thanks to God, 
yea,  all  their  men  and  all  their 
women and all their children that 
could  speak  lifted  their  voices  in 
the praises of their God.
