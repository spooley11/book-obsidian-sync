39 Why  do  ye  adorn  yourselves 
with that which hath no life, and 
yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, 
and the naked, and the sick and the 
afflicted to pass by you, and notice 
them not?

40 Yea, why do ye build up your 
a secret abominations to get gain, and 
cause  that  widows  should  mourn 
before the Lord, and also orphans 
to mourn before the Lord, and also 
the blood of their fathers and their 
husbands to cry unto the Lord from 
the  ground,  for  vengeance  upon 
your heads?

41 Behold, the sword of vengeance 
hangeth over you; and the time soon 
cometh that he avengeth the a blood 
of the saints upon you, for he will 
not suffer their cries any longer.

CHAPTER 9

Moroni calls upon those who do not be-
lieve in Christ to repent—He proclaims

a God of miracles, who gives revelations 
and  pours  out  gifts  and  signs  upon 
the  faithful—Miracles  cease  because 
of  unbelief—Signs  follow  those  who 
believe—Men are exhorted to be wise 
and  keep  the  commandments.  About  
a.d. 401–21.
And now, I speak also concerning 
those who do not believe in Christ.
2 Behold, will ye believe in the day 
of  your  visitation—behold,  when 
the Lord shall come, yea, even that 
a great day when the b earth shall be 
rolled together as a scroll, and the 
elements  shall  c melt  with  fervent 
heat, yea, in that great day when 
ye shall be brought to stand before 
the Lamb of God—then will ye say 
that there is no God?

3 Then  will  ye  longer  deny  the 
Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb 
of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall 
dwell with him under a a conscious-
ness of your guilt? Do ye suppose 
that ye could be happy to dwell with 
that  holy  Being,  when  your  souls 
are  racked  with  a  consciousness 
of  guilt  that  ye  have  ever  abused  
his laws?

4 Behold, I say unto you that ye 
would be more miserable to dwell 
with a holy and just God, under a 
consciousness  of  your  a filthiness 
before him, than ye would to dwell 
with the b damned souls in c hell.
