The  invading  Lamanites  are  unable 
to take the fortified cities of Ammoni-
hah  and  Noah—Amalickiah  curses 
God and swears to drink the blood of  
Moroni—Helaman  and  his  brethren 
continue  to  strengthen  the  Church. 
About 72 b.c.
And now it came to pass in the elev-
enth month of the nineteenth year, 
on the tenth day of the month, the 
armies of the Lamanites were seen 
approaching  towards  the  land  of 
a Ammonihah.

2 And behold, the city had been 
rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed 
an army by the borders of the city, 
and  they  had  a cast  up  dirt  round 
about to shield them from the ar-
rows and the b stones of the Laman-
ites;  for  behold,  they  fought  with 
stones and with arrows.

3 Behold,  I  said  that  the  city  of 
a Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say 
unto  you,  yea,  that  it  was  in  part 
rebuilt;  and  because  the  Laman-
ites had destroyed it once because 
of the iniquity of the people, they 
supposed  that  it  would  again  be-
come an easy prey for them.

4 But behold, how great was their 
disappointment;  for  behold,  the 
Nephites  had  dug  up  a  a ridge  of 
earth round about them, which was 
so  high  that  the  Lamanites  could 
not cast their stones and their ar-
rows at them that they might take 
effect, neither could they come upon 
them save it was by their place of 
b entrance.

5 Now at this time the chief a cap-
tains of the Lamanites were aston-
ished exceedingly, because of the 
wisdom of the Nephites in prepar-
ing their places of security.

6 Now the leaders of the Lamanites
