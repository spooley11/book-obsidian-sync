7 And now, if ye do not this, be-
hold,  ye  are  in  our  hands,  and  I 
will  command  my  men  that  they 
shall fall upon you, and a inflict the 
wounds of death in your bodies, that 
ye may become extinct; and then 
we will see who shall have power 
over  this  people;  yea,  we  will  see 
who shall be brought into bondage.
8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Zerahemnah had heard these 
sayings he came forth and delivered 
up his a sword and his cimeter, and 
his bow into the hands of Moroni, 
and said unto him: Behold, here are

ALMA 44  : 9–19

our weapons of war; we will deliver 
them up unto you, but we will not 
suffer  ourselves  to  take  an  b oath 
unto you, which we know that we 
shall break, and also our children; 
but take our weapons of war, and 
suffer that we may depart into the 
wilderness;  otherwise  we  will  re-
tain our swords, and we will perish 
or conquer.

9 Behold, we are a not of your faith; 
we do not believe that it is God that 
has delivered us into your hands; but 
we believe that it is your cunning 
that  has  preserved  you  from  our 
swords. Behold, it is your  b breast-
plates  and  your  shields  that  have 
preserved you.

10 And  now  when  Zerahemnah 
had made an end of speaking these 
words, Moroni returned the sword 
and the weapons of war, which he 
had  received,  unto  Zerahemnah, 
saying:  Behold,  we  will  end  the  
conflict.

11 Now I cannot recall the words 
which  I  have  spoken,  therefore 
as  the  Lord  liveth,  ye  shall  not 
depart  except  ye  depart  with  an 
oath that ye will not return again 
against us to war. Now as ye are in 
our hands we will spill your blood 
upon the ground, or ye shall sub-
mit to the conditions which I have  
proposed.
