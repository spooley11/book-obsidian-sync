14 And thus we see the great call 
of a diligence of men to labor in the 
vineyards of the Lord; and thus we 
see the great reason of sorrow, and 
also  of  rejoicing—sorrow  because 
of  death  and  destruction  among 
men, and joy because of the b light 
of Christ unto life.

CHAPTER 29
Alma desires to cry repentance with an-
gelic zeal—The Lord grants teachers for 
all nations—Alma glories in the Lord’s 
work and in the success of Ammon and 
his brethren. About 76 b.c.
O that I were an angel, and could 
have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the 
a trump of God, with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto 
every people!

2 Yea, I would declare unto every 
soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance and the plan of redemp-
tion, that they should repent and 
a come  unto  our  God,  that  there 
might not be more sorrow upon all 
the face of the earth.

3 But behold, I am a man, and do 
sin  in  my  wish;  for  I  ought  to  be 
content with the things which the 
Lord hath allotted unto me.

4 I ought not to harrow up in my 
desires the firm decree of a just God,

for I know that he granteth unto men  
according to their a desire, whether 
it be unto death or unto life; yea, 
I know that he allotteth unto men, 
yea,  decreeth  unto  them  decrees 
which are unalterable, according to 
their b wills, whether they be unto 
salvation or unto destruction.

5 Yea, and I know that good and 
evil have come before all men; he 
that knoweth not good from evil is 
a blameless;  but  he  that  b knoweth 
good and evil, to him it is given ac-
cording to his desires, whether he 
desireth good or evil, life or death, 
joy or remorse of c conscience.

6 Now,  seeing  that  I  know  these 
things,  why  should  I  desire  more 
than to a perform the work to which 
I have been called?

7 Why should I desire that I were 
an  angel,  that  I  could  speak  unto 
all the ends of the earth?
