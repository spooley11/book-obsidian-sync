12 But,  behold,  they  shall  have 
a wars, and rumors of wars; and when 
the day cometh that the b Only Be-
gotten of the Father, yea, even the 
Father of heaven and of earth, shall 
c manifest himself unto them in the 
flesh, behold, they will reject him, 
because of their iniquities, and the 
hardness  of  their  hearts,  and  the 
stiffness of their necks.

13 Behold, they will a crucify him; 
and after he is laid in a b sepulchre 
for the space of c three days he shall 
d rise from the dead, with healing in 
his wings; and all those who shall 
believe on his name shall be saved

in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, 
my soul delighteth to prophesy con-
cerning  him,  for  I  have  e seen  his 
day,  and  my  heart  doth  magnify 
his holy name.

14 And  behold  it  shall  come  to 
pass  that  after  the  a Messiah  hath 
risen  from  the  dead,  and  hath 
mani fested  himself  unto  his  peo-
ple, unto as many as will believe on 
his name, behold, Jerusalem shall 
be  b destroyed again; for  c wo unto 
them  that  fight  against  God  and 
the people of his d church.

15 Wherefore, the  a Jews shall be 
b scattered among all nations; yea, 
and  also  c Babylon  shall  be  de-
stroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be  
scattered by other nations.

16 And  after  they  have  been 
a scattered, and the Lord God hath 
scourged  them  by  other  nations 
for the space of many generations, 
yea, even down from generation to 
genera tion until they shall be per-
suaded to b believe in Christ, the Son 
of God, and the atonement, which 
is  infinite  for  all  mankind—and 
when that day shall come that they 
shall believe in Christ, and worship 
the Father in his name, with pure 
hearts and c clean hands, and look 
not forward any more for d another 
Messiah, then, at that time, the day 
will come that it must needs be ex-
pedient  that  they  should  believe 
these things.
