insomuch that they were gathered 
together in one body in the valley, 
upon the bank by the river Sidon.
52 Therefore the armies of Moroni 
encircled  them  about,  yea,  even 
on both sides of the river, for be-
hold, on the east were the men of  
Lehi.

53 Therefore  when  Zerahemnah 
saw the men of Lehi on the east of 
the river Sidon, and the armies of 
Moroni on the west of the river Si-
don, that they were encircled about 
by the Nephites, they were struck 
with terror.

54 Now Moroni, when he saw their 
a terror,  commanded  his  men  that 
they  should  stop  shedding  their 
blood.

CHAPTER 44

Moroni  commands  the  Lamanites  to 
make  a  covenant  of  peace  or  be  de-
stroyed—Zerahemnah rejects the offer,  
and the battle resumes—Moroni’s armies  
defeat the Lamanites. About 74–73 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
stop  and  withdrew  a  pace  from 
them. And Moroni said unto a Zera-
hemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that 
we do b not desire to be men of blood. 
Ye know that ye are in our hands, 
yet we do not desire to slay you.
