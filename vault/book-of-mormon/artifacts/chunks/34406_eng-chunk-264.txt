JACOB 7  : 18–27

of the Holy Ghost, and the minis-
tering of angels.

18 And  he  spake  plainly  unto 
them, that he had been  a deceived 
by the power of the b devil. And he 
spake of hell, and of c eternity, and 
of eternal d punishment.

19 And he said: I a fear lest I have 
committed the b unpardonable sin, 
for I have lied unto God; for I de-
nied the Christ, and said that I be-
lieved the scriptures; and they truly 
testify of him. And because I have 
thus  lied  unto  God  I  greatly  fear 
lest my case shall be c awful; but I 
confess unto God.

20 And it came to pass that when 
he had said these words he could say  
no more, and he a gave up the b ghost.
21 And when the multitude had 
witnessed that he spake these things 
as he was about to give up the ghost, 
they were astonished exceedingly; 
insomuch  that  the  power  of  God 
came  down  upon  them,  and  they 
were  a overcome  that  they  fell  to 
the earth.

22 Now,  this  thing  was  pleasing 
unto me, Jacob, for I had requested 
it of my Father who was in heaven; 
for  he  had  heard  my  cry  and  an-
swered my prayer.

23 And it came to pass that peace 
and the a love of God was restored 
again among the people; and they 
b searched the scriptures, and heark-
ened no more to the words of this 
wicked man.

24 And it came to pass that many 
means  were  devised  to  a reclaim 
and  restore  the  Lamanites  to  the 
knowledge of the truth; but it all

was  b vain,  for  they  delighted  in 
c wars and d bloodshed, and they had 
an eternal e hatred against us, their 
brethren. And they sought by the 
power of their arms to destroy us 
continually.
