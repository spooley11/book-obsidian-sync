9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did so, and did drink of it and were 
filled; and they gave unto the mul-
titude, and they did drink, and they 
were filled.

10 And  when  the  disciples  had 
done  this,  Jesus  said  unto  them: 
Blessed are ye for this thing which 
ye have done, for this is fulfilling 
my commandments, and this doth 
witness unto the Father that ye are 
a willing  to  do  that  which  I  have 
commanded you.

11 And this shall ye always do to 
those who repent and are baptized 
in my name; and ye shall do it in 
a remembrance of my b blood, which 
I  have  shed  for  you,  that  ye  may 
witness unto the Father that ye do 
always  remember  me.  And  if  ye  
do  always  remember  me  ye  shall 
have my Spirit to be with you.

12 And  I  give  unto  you  a  com-
mandment  that  ye  shall  do  these 
things.  And  if  ye  shall  always  do 
these things blessed are ye, for ye 
are built upon my a rock.

13 But  whoso  among  you  shall 
do a more or less than these are not 
built upon my rock, but are built 
upon a sandy foundation; and when 
the rain descends, and the floods 
come, and the winds blow, and beat 
upon them, they shall b fall, and the 
c gates of hell are ready open to re-
ceive them.

14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye 
shall  keep  my  commandments, 
which the Father hath commanded 
me that I should give unto you.
