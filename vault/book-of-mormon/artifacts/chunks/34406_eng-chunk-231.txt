And if ye shall c believe in Christ ye  
will believe in these d words, for they 
are the e words of Christ, and he hath 
given them unto me; and they f teach  
all men that they should do good.
11 And if they are not the words 
of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will  
show  unto  you,  with  a power  and 
great b glory, that they are his words, 
at the last day; and you and I shall 
stand face to face before his bar; and 
ye shall know that I have been com-
manded of him to write these things, 
notwithstanding my weakness.

12 And  I  pray  the  Father  in  the 
name of Christ that many of us, if 
not all, may be saved in his a king-
dom at that great and last day.

13 And now, my beloved brethren,

all  those  who  are  of  the  house  of  
Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, 
I speak unto you as the voice of one 
a crying from the dust: Farewell un-
til that great day shall come.

14 And you that will not partake 
of the goodness of God, and respect 
the words of the a Jews, and also my 
b words, and the words which shall 
proceed forth out of the mouth of 
the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you 
an  everlasting  farewell,  for  these 
words  shall  c condemn  you  at  the 
last day.

15 For what I seal on earth, shall 
be brought against you at the a judg-
ment  bar;  for  thus  hath  the  Lord 
commanded me, and I must b obey. 
Amen.

The brOTher Of nePhi

The words of his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a man who 
seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ. A few words concerning the his-
tory of the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 1

Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men 
to believe in Christ and keep His com-
mandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness 
prevails  among  the  Nephites.  About 
544–421 b.c.

FOR  behold,  it  came  to  pass

that  fifty  and  five  years  had  
passed  away  from  the  time 
that  Lehi  left  Jerusalem;  where-
fore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a a com-

mandment  concerning  the  b small 
plates, upon which these things are  
engraven.
