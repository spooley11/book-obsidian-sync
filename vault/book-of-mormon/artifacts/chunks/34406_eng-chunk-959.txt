16 And when he had come to the 
plains of Agosh he gave battle unto 
Lib, and he smote upon him until 
he died; nevertheless, the brother 
of Lib did come against Coriantumr 
in the stead thereof, and the battle 
became  exceedingly  sore,  in  the 
which  Coriantumr  fled  again  be-
fore the army of the brother of Lib.
17 Now the name of the brother 
of Lib was called Shiz. And it came 
to  pass  that  Shiz  pursued  after 
Cori antumr, and he did overthrow 
many cities, and he did slay both 
women  and  children,  and  he  did 
burn the cities.

18 And there went a fear of Shiz 
throughout all the land; yea, a cry 
went forth throughout the land—
Who can stand before the army of 
Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth 
before him!

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people began to flock together in 
armies, throughout all the face of 
the land.

20 And they were divided; and a 
part  of  them  fled  to  the  army  of 
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the 
army of Coriantumr.

21 And  so  great  and  lasting  had

been  the  war,  and  so  long  had 
been  the  scene  of  bloodshed  and 
carnage, that the whole face of the 
land was covered with the a bodies 
of the b dead.

22 And  so  swift  and  speedy  was 
the war that there was none left to 
bury the dead, but they did march 
forth from the shedding of a blood 
to  the  shedding  of  blood,  leaving 
the bodies of both men, women, and 
children strewed upon the face of 
the land, to become a prey to the 
b worms of the flesh.

23 And  the  a scent  thereof  went 
forth  upon  the  face  of  the  land,  
even upon all the face of the land; 
wherefore the people became trou-
bled by day and by night, because 
of the scent thereof.

24 Nevertheless, Shiz did a not cease 
to pursue Coriantumr; for he had 
sworn to avenge himself upon Cori-
antumr of the blood of his brother, 
who had been slain, and the word 
of  the  Lord  which  came  to  Ether 
that Coriantumr should not fall by 
the sword.
