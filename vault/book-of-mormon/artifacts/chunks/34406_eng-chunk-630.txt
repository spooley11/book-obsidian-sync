29 Therefore, Morianton put it into 
their hearts that they should flee 
to the land which was northward, 
which was covered with a large bod-
ies of water, and take possession of 
the land which was b northward.

30 And behold, they would have 
carried this plan into effect, (which 
would  have  been  a  cause  to  have 
been lamented) but behold, Mori-
anton being a man of much passion, 
therefore he was angry with one of 
his maid servants, and he fell upon 
her and beat her much.

31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  she 
fled, and came over to the camp of 
Moroni, and told Moroni all things 
concerning  the  matter,  and  also 
concerning their intentions to flee 
into the land northward.

32 Now  behold,  the  people  who 
were in the land Bountiful, or rather 
Moroni,  feared  that  they  would 
hearken  to  the  words  of  Morian-
ton and unite with his people, and 
thus  he  would  obtain  possession 
of  those  parts  of  the  land,  which 
would lay a foundation for serious 
consequences among the people of 
Nephi,  yea,  which  a consequences 
would lead to the overthrow of their  
b liberty.

33 Therefore Moroni sent an army, 
with their camp, to head the people 
of  Morianton,  to  stop  their  flight 
into the land northward.

34 And it came to pass that they 
did not a head them until they had

come  to  the  borders  of  the  land 
b Desolation;  and  there  they  did 
head  them,  by  the  narrow  pass 
which led by the sea into the land 
northward, yea, by the sea, on the 
west and on the east.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
army  which  was  sent  by  Moroni, 
which  was  led  by  a  man  whose 
name was Teancum, did meet the 
people of Morianton; and so stub-
born were the people of Morianton, 
(being inspired by his wickedness 
and  his  a flattering  words)  that  a 
battle commenced between them, 
in  the  which  Teancum  did  b slay 
Morianton and defeat his army, and 
took them prisoners, and returned 
to  the  camp  of  Moroni.  And  thus 
ended the twenty and fourth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.
