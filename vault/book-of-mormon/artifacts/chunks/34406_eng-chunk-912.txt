11 And  this  cometh  unto  you,  O 
ye a Gentiles, that ye may know the 
decrees of God—that ye may repent, 
and  not  continue  in  your  iniqui-
ties  until  the  fulness  come,  that  
ye may not bring down the fulness 
of the  b wrath of God upon you as 
the  inhabitants  of  the  land  have  
hitherto done.

12 Behold,  this  is  a  choice  land, 
and  whatsoever  nation  shall  pos-
sess it shall be a free from bondage, 
and  from  captivity,  and  from  all 
other nations under heaven, if they 
will but b serve the God of the land, 
who is Jesus Christ, who hath been 
manifested by the things which we 
have written.

13 And  now  I  proceed  with  my 
record; for behold, it came to pass 
that the Lord did bring Jared and 
his brethren forth even to that great 
sea which divideth the lands. And 
as they came to the sea they pitched 
their  tents;  and  they  called  the 
name  of  the  place  a Moriancumer; 
and they dwelt in b tents, and dwelt 
in tents upon the seashore for the 
space of four years.

14 And it came to pass at the end 
of  four  years  that  the  Lord  came 
again  unto  the  brother  of  Jared, 
and  stood  in  a  cloud  and  a talked 
with him. And for the space of three 
hours  did  the  Lord  talk  with  the 
brother  of  Jared,  and  b chastened 
him  because  he  remembered  not 
to c call upon the name of the Lord.
15 And  the  brother  of  Jared  re-
pented of the evil which he had done, 
and did call upon the name of the 
Lord for his brethren who were with 
him. And the Lord said unto him: I 
will forgive thee and thy brethren 
of their sins; but thou shalt not sin
