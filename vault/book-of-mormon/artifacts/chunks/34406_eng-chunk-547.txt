Behold, I say unto you, that it is on 
the  one  hand  even  as  it  is  on  the 
other;  and  it  shall  be  unto  every 
man according to his work.

21 And now as I said concerning 
faith—a faith  is  not  to  have  a  per-
fect knowledge of things; therefore 
if ye have faith ye b hope for things 
which are c not seen, which are true.
22 And  now,  behold,  I  say  unto 
you, and I would that ye should re-
member, that God is a merciful unto 
all who believe on his name; there-
fore he desireth, in the first place, 
that  ye  should  believe,  yea,  even  
on his word.

23 And now, he imparteth his word 
by angels unto men, yea, a not only 
men but women also. Now this is not 
all; little  b children do have words 
given unto them many times, which 
c confound the wise and the learned.
24 And now, my beloved brethren, 
as ye have desired to know of me 
what ye shall do because ye are af-
flicted and cast out—now I do not 
desire that ye should suppose that 
I mean to judge you only according 
to that which is true—

25 For I do not mean that ye all of 
you have been compelled to hum-
ble yourselves; for I verily believe 
that there are some among you who 
a would humble themselves, let them 
be  in  whatsoever  circumstances 
they might.

26 Now, as I said concerning faith—
that  it  was  not  a  perfect  knowl-
edge—even so it is with my words. 
Ye cannot know of their surety at 
first,  unto  perfection,  any  more 
than faith is a perfect knowledge.
27 But  behold,  if  ye  will  awake 
and arouse your faculties, even to 
an experiment upon my words, and
