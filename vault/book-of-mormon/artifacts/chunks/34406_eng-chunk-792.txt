8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, 
and  the  city  of  Gadiomnah,  and 
the  city  of  Jacob,  and  the  city  of 
Gimgimno, all these have I caused 
to be sunk, and made a hills and val-
leys in the places thereof; and the 
inhabitants thereof have I b buried 
up  in  the  depths  of  the  earth,  to 
hide their wickedness and abomi-
nations from before my face, that 
the blood of the prophets and the 
saints should not come up any more 
unto me against them.

9 And  behold,  that  great  city 
Jacobu gath,  which  was  inhabited 
by the people of king Jacob, have I  
caused to be burned with fire be-
cause of their sins and their a wick-
edness,  which  was  above  all  the 
wickedness of the whole earth, be-
cause of their b secret murders and 
combinations; for it was they that did 
c destroy the peace of my people and 
the government of the land; there-
fore I did cause them to be burned, 
to  d destroy  them  from  before  my 
face, that the blood of the prophets 
and the saints should not come up  
unto me any more against them.

10 And behold, the city of Laman, 
and the city of Josh, and the city 
of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, 
have  I  caused  to  be  burned  with 
fire,  and  the  inhabitants  thereof, 
because of their wickedness in cast-
ing out the prophets, and stoning 
those whom I did send to declare 
unto them concerning their wick-
edness and their abominations.
