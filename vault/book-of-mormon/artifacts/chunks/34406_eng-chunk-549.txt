34 And now, behold, is your a knowl-
edge b perfect? Yea, your knowledge 
is  perfect  in  that  thing,  and  your 
c faith is dormant; and this because 
you  know,  for  ye  know  that  the 
word hath swelled your souls, and 
ye also know that it hath sprouted 
up, that your understanding doth 
begin to be enlightened, and your 
d mind doth begin to expand.

35 O  then,  is  not  this  real?  I  say 
unto you, Yea, because it is a light; 
and  whatsoever  is  light,  is  b good, 
because it is discernible, therefore 
ye must know that it is good; and 
now  behold,  after  ye  have  tasted 
this light is your knowledge perfect?
36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; nei-
ther must ye lay aside your faith, for 
ye have only exercised your faith 
to plant the seed that ye might try 
the experiment to know if the seed 
was good.

37 And behold, as the tree begin-
neth  to  grow,  ye  will  say:  Let  us 
nourish it with great care, that it 
may get root, that it may grow up, 
and bring forth fruit unto us. And 
now behold, if ye nourish it with 
much care it will get root, and grow 
up, and bring forth fruit.

38 But if ye a neglect the tree, and 
take no thought for its nourishment, 
behold it will not get any root; and 
when the heat of the sun cometh 
and scorcheth it, because it hath no 
root it withers away, and ye pluck 
it up and cast it out.

39 Now,  this  is  not  because  the 
seed was not good, neither is it be-
cause the fruit thereof would not 
be desirable; but it is because your 
a ground is b barren, and ye will not 
nourish the tree, therefore ye can-
not have the fruit thereof.
