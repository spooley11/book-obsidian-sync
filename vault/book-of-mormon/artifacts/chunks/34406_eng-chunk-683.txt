25 And  now  when  Moroni  saw 
that they were fleeing before him, 
he did cause that his men should 
march forth against them, and slew 
many, and surrounded many oth-
ers, and took them prisoners; and 
the remainder of them fled into the 
land of Moroni, which was in the 
borders by the seashore.

26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran 
obtained the a possession of the city 
of Nephihah without the loss of one 
soul; and there were many of the 
Lamanites who were slain.

27 Now it came to pass that many 
of the Lamanites that were prisoners 
were desirous to a join the people of 
Ammon and become a free people.
28 And it came to pass that as many 
as were desirous, unto them it was 
granted according to their desires.
29 Therefore, all the prisoners of

the Lamanites did join the people 
of Ammon, and did begin to labor 
exceedingly, tilling the ground, rais-
ing all manner of grain, and flocks 
and herds of every kind; and thus 
were the Nephites relieved from a 
great  burden;  yea,  insomuch  that 
they  were  relieved  from  all  the 
prisoners of the Lamanites.

30 Now it came to pass that Moroni, 
after he had obtained possession of 
the city of Nephihah, having taken 
many prisoners, which did reduce 
the armies of the Lamanites exceed-
ingly, and having regained many of 
the Nephites who had been taken 
prisoners, which did strengthen the  
army of Moroni exceedingly; there-
fore Moroni went forth from the land  
of Nephihah to the land of a Lehi.

31 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites saw that Moroni was 
coming  against  them,  they  were 
again  frightened  and  fled  before 
the army of Moroni.

32 And it came to pass that a Mo-
roni and his army did pursue them 
from  city  to  city,  until  they  were 
met by Lehi and Teancum; and the 
Lamanites fled from Lehi and Tean-
cum, even down upon the borders 
by the seashore, until they came to 
the land of Moroni.
