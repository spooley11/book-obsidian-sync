19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did 
build up his kingdom in his stead; 
nevertheless they did not gain power 
any more over Shule the king, and 
the  people  who  were  under  the 
reign of Shule the king did prosper 
exceedingly and wax great.

20 And the country was a divided; 
and there were two kingdoms, the 
kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom 
of Cohor, the son of Noah.

21 And  Cohor,  the  son  of  Noah, 
caused that his people should give 
battle unto Shule, in which Shule 
did beat them and did slay Cohor.
22 And now Cohor had a son who 
was  called  Nimrod;  and  Nimrod 
gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto 
Shule, and he did gain favor in the 
eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did 
bestow great favors upon him, and 
he did do in the kingdom of Shule 
according to his desires.

23 And also in the reign of Shule 
there came a prophets among the peo-
ple,  who  were  sent  from  the  Lord, 
prophesying that the wickedness and 
b idolatry of the people was bringing a 
curse upon the land, and they should 
be destroyed if they did not repent.

24 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did a revile against the prophets, 
and did mock them. And it came 
to pass that king Shule did execute 
judgment against all those who did 
revile against the prophets.

25 And  he  did  execute  a  law 
throughout  all  the  land,  which 
gave power unto the prophets that 
they should go whithersoever they 
would; and by this cause the peo-
ple were brought unto repentance.
26 And because the people did re-
pent of their iniquities and idola-
tries the Lord did spare them, and 
they began to prosper again in the 
land. And it came to pass that Shule 
a begat  sons  and  daughters  in  his  
old age.
