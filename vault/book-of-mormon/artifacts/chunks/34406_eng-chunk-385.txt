25 And the Lord said unto me: Mar-
vel not that all mankind, yea, men 
and women, all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and people, must be a born 
again; yea, b born of God, c changed 
from their carnal and d fallen state, 
to a state of righteousness, being re-
deemed of God, becoming his e sons 
and daughters;

26 And  thus  they  become  new 
creatures; and unless they do this, 
they  can  in  a nowise  inherit  the 
kingdom of God.

27 I say unto you, unless this be 
the case, they must be cast off; and 
this I know, because I was like to 
be cast off.

28 Nevertheless,  after  a wading 
through much b tribulation, repent-
ing  nigh  unto  death,  the  Lord  in

mercy  hath  seen  fit  to  snatch  me 
out of an c everlasting burning, and 
I am born of God.

29 My soul hath been a redeemed 
from  the  gall  of  bitterness  and 
b bonds  of  iniquity.  I  was  in  the 
darkest  abyss;  but  now  I  behold 
the marvelous light of God. My soul 
was c racked with eternal torment; 
but I am snatched, and my soul is 
d pained no more.

30 I  rejected  my  Redeemer,  and 
denied that which had been spoken 
of by our fathers; but now that they 
may foresee that he will come, and 
that  he  remembereth  every  crea-
ture of his creating, he will make 
himself manifest unto a all.

31 Yea, a every knee shall bow, and 
every  tongue  confess  before  him. 
Yea, even at the last day, when all 
men  shall  stand  to  be  b judged  of 
him,  then  shall  they  confess  that 
he is c God; then shall they confess, 
who live d without God in the world, 
that  the  judgment  of  an  everlast-
ing punishment is just upon them; 
and they shall quake, and tremble, 
and shrink beneath the glance of 
his e all-searching eye.

32 And now it came to pass that 
Alma began from this time forward 
to teach the people, and those who 
were  with  Alma  at  the  time  the 
angel  appeared  unto  them,  trav-
eling round about through all the 
land, publishing to all the people 
the  things  which  they  had  heard 
and seen, and preaching the word 
of God in much tribulation, being 
greatly  persecuted  by  those  who 
were unbelievers, being smitten by 
many of them.
