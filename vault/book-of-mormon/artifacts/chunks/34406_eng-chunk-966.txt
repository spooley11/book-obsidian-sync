3 Now  Christ  spake  these  words 
unto them at the time of his first 
appearing; and the multitude heard 
it  not,  but  the  disciples  heard  it; 
and on as many as they a laid their 
hands, fell the Holy Ghost.

CHAPTER 3

Elders  ordain  priests  and  teachers 
by  the  laying  on  of  hands.  About  
a.d. 401–21.
The  manner  which  the  disciples, 
who  were  called  the  a elders  of 
the church, b ordained c priests and 
teachers—

2 After they had prayed unto the 
Father in the name of Christ, they 
a laid their hands upon them, and 
said:

3 In  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  I 
ordain you to be a priest (or if he 
be a a teacher, I ordain you to be a 
teacher) to preach repentance and 
b remission  of  sins  through  Jesus 
Christ,  by  the  endurance  of  faith 
on his name to the end. Amen.

4 And after this manner did they 
a ordain priests and teachers, accord-
ing to the b gifts and callings of God

unto men; and they ordained them 
by  the  c power  of  the  Holy  Ghost, 
which was in them.

CHAPTER 4
How elders and priests administer the 
sacramental bread is explained. About 
a.d. 401–21.
The  a manner of their  b elders and 
priests administering the flesh and 
blood  of  Christ  unto  the  church; 
and they administered it  c accord-
ing to the commandments of Christ; 
wherefore we know the manner to 
be true; and the elder or priest did 
minister it—

2 And they did kneel down with 
the a church, and pray to the Father 
in the name of Christ, saying:

3 O  God,  the  Eternal  Father,  we 
ask  thee  in  the  name  of  thy  Son, 
Jesus Christ, to bless and a sanctify 
this b bread to the souls of all those 
who  partake  of  it;  that  they  may 
eat  in  c remembrance  of  the  body 
of thy Son, and witness unto thee, 
O  God,  the  Eternal  Father,  that 
they are willing to take upon them 
the  d name of thy Son, and always 
remember him, and keep his com-
mandments  which  he  hath  given 
them,  that  they  may  always  have 
his e Spirit to be with them. Amen.
