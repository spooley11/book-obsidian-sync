are none of them that have seen so 
great things as ye have seen; neither 
have they heard so great things as 
ye have heard.

CHAPTER 20
Jesus provides bread and wine miracu-
lously and again administers the sac-
rament unto the people—The remnant 
of Jacob will come to the knowledge of 
the Lord their God and will inherit the 
Americas—Jesus is the prophet like unto 
Moses, and the Nephites are children 
of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s 
people  will  be  gathered  to  Jerusalem. 
About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that he com-
manded  the  multitude  that  they 
should a cease to b pray, and also his 
disciples. And he commanded them 
that they should not cease to pray 
in their hearts.

2 And he commanded them that 
they should arise and stand up upon 
their feet. And they arose up and 
stood upon their feet.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
a brake  b bread  again  and  blessed 
it, and gave to the disciples to eat.
4 And when they had eaten he com-
manded them that they should break  
bread, and give unto the multitude.
5 And when they had given unto 
the  multitude  he  also  gave  them 
wine  to  drink,  and  commanded 
them  that  they  should  give  unto 
the multitude.

6 Now, there had been no a bread, 
neither wine, brought by the dis-
ciples, neither by the multitude;

7 But  he  truly  a gave  unto  them 
bread to eat, and also wine to drink.

8 And he said unto them: He that 
eateth  this  bread  eateth  of  a my 
body to his soul; and he that drink-
eth  of  this  wine  drinketh  of  my 
blood to his soul; and his soul shall 
never hunger nor thirst, but shall  
be filled.
