23 Now when the Lamanites saw 
that their brethren would not flee 
from the sword, neither would they 
turn aside to the right hand or to the 
left, but that they would lie down 
and a perish, and b praised God even 
in the very act of perishing under 
the sword—

24 Now when the Lamanites saw

this they did a forbear from slaying 
them; and there were many whose 
hearts had b swollen in them for those  
of  their  brethren  who  had  fallen 
under the sword, for they repented 
of the things which they had done.
25 And it came to pass that they 
threw down their weapons of war, 
and  they  would  not  take  them  
again, for they were stung for the 
murders which they had committed; 
and they came down even as their 
brethren, relying upon the mercies 
of those whose arms were lifted to  
slay them.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of God were joined that day 
by more than the number who had 
been slain; and those who had been 
slain were righteous people, there-
fore we have no reason to doubt but 
what they were a saved.

27 And there was not a wicked man 
slain among them; but there were 
more than a thousand brought to 
the knowledge of the truth; thus we 
see that the Lord worketh in many 
a ways to the salvation of his people.
28 Now  the  greatest  number  of 
those of the Lamanites who slew so 
many of their brethren were Amale-
kites and Amulonites, the greatest 
number  of  whom  were  after  the 
a order of the b Nehors.

29 Now, among those who joined 
the people of the Lord, there were 
a none who were Amalekites or Amu-
lonites, or who were of the order of  
Nehor, but they were actual descen-
dants of Laman and Lemuel.

30 And  thus  we  can  plainly  dis-
cern, that after a people have been 
once a enlightened by the b Spirit of 
God, and have had great c knowledge 
of things pertaining to righteous-
ness, and then have d fallen away into
