6 Wherefore,  I,  Lehi,  prophesy 
according  to  the  workings  of  the 
Spirit  which  is  in  me,  that  there 
shall a none come into this land save 
they shall be brought by the hand 
of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, this  a land is conse-
crated  unto  him  whom  he  shall 
bring. And if it so be that they shall 
serve  him  according  to  the  com-
mandments which he hath given, 
it shall be a land of  b liberty unto 
them; wherefore, they shall never 
be brought down into captivity; if 
so, it shall be because of iniquity; 
for if iniquity shall abound c cursed 
shall  be  the  land  for  their  sakes, 
but unto the righteous it shall be 
blessed forever.

8 And  behold,  it  is  wisdom  that 
this land should be a kept as yet from 
the knowledge of other b nations; for 
behold, many nations would over-
run the land, that there would be 
no place for an inheritance.

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained 
a a promise, that b inasmuch as those 
whom the Lord God shall bring out 
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep 
his commandments, they shall c pros-
per upon the face of this land; and 
they  shall  be  kept  from  all  other 
nations, that they may possess this 
land unto themselves. And if it so be  
that they shall d keep his command-
ments they shall be blessed upon 
the face of this land, and there shall

be none to molest them, nor to take 
away the land of their e inheritance; 
and they shall dwell safely forever.
10 But  behold,  when  the  time 
cometh that they shall dwindle in 
a unbelief, after they have received 
so great blessings from the hand of 
the  Lord—having  a  knowledge  of 
the  creation  of  the  earth,  and  all 
men, knowing the great and mar-
velous works of the Lord from the 
creation of the world; having power 
given them to do all things by faith; 
having all the commandments from 
the  beginning,  and  having  been 
brought  by  his  infinite  goodness 
into this precious land of promise—
behold, I say, if the day shall come 
that they will reject the Holy One 
of  Israel,  the  true  b Messiah,  their 
Redeemer  and  their  God,  behold, 
the judgments of him that is c just 
shall rest upon them.
