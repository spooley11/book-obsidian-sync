HELAMAN 5  : 22–36

22 And after they had been cast 
into  prison  many  days  without 
food, behold, they went forth into 
the prison to take them that they 
might slay them.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi were encircled about a as 
if by b fire, even insomuch that they 
durst not lay their hands upon them 
for fear lest they should be burned. 
Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were 
not burned; and they were as stand-
ing in the midst of fire and were 
not burned.

24 And when they saw that they 
were encircled about with a a pillar 
of fire, and that it burned them not, 
their hearts did take courage.

25 For they saw that the Laman-
ites durst not lay their hands upon 
them; neither durst they come near 
unto them, but stood as if they were 
struck dumb with amazement.

26 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did stand forth and began 
to speak unto them, saying:  a Fear 
not, for behold, it is God that has 
shown  unto  you  this  marvelous 
thing, in the which is shown unto 
you that ye cannot lay your hands 
on us to slay us.

27 And  behold,  when  they  had 
said these words, the earth shook 
exceedingly,  and  the  walls  of  the 
prison  did  shake  as  if  they  were 
about to tumble to the earth; but 
behold, they did not fall. And be-
hold, they that were in the prison 
were Lamanites and Nephites who 
were dissenters.

28 And it came to pass that they 
were  overshadowed  with  a  cloud 
of a darkness, and an awful solemn 
fear came upon them.

29 And it came to pass that there 
came a a voice as if it were above the 
cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye,

repent ye, and seek no more to de-
stroy my b servants whom I have sent  
unto you to declare good tidings.
