13 Now  we  will  return  again  to 
the Amlicites, for they also had a 
a mark set upon them; yea, they set 
the  mark  upon  themselves,  yea, 
even  a  mark  of  red  upon  their  
foreheads.

14 Thus  the  word  of  God  is  ful-
filled, for these are the words which 
he  said  to  Nephi:  Behold,  the  La-
manites  have  I  cursed,  and  I  will 
set a mark on them that they and 
their seed may be a separated from 
thee and thy seed, from this time 
henceforth and forever, except they 
repent  of  their  wickedness  and 
b turn to me that I may have mercy  
upon them.

15 And  again:  I  will  set  a  mark 
upon  him  that  mingleth  his  seed 
with thy brethren, that they may 
be cursed also.

16 And  again:  I  will  set  a  mark 
upon him that fighteth against thee 
and thy seed.

17 And  again,  I  say  he  that  de-
parteth  from  thee  shall  no  more 
be called thy seed; and I will bless 
thee,  and  whomsoever  shall  be 
called  thy  seed,  henceforth  and 
forever; and these were the prom-
ises of the Lord unto Nephi and to  
his seed.

18 Now  the  Amlicites  knew  not 
that they were fulfilling the words 
of God when they began to mark 
themselves in their foreheads; nev-
ertheless they had come out in open 
a rebellion against God; therefore it 
was expedient that the curse should 
fall upon them.

19 Now  I  would  that  ye  should 
see that they brought upon them-
selves the a curse; and even so doth 
every  man  that  is  cursed  bring
