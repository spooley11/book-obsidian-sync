Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to

manite king permits them to inherit the

and Zeniff’s people. About 200–187 b.c.
a I,  b Zeniff, having been taught in 
all  the  language  of  the  Nephites, 
and having had a knowledge of the 
land of c Nephi, or of the land of our 
fathers’ first inheritance, and hav-
ing been sent as a spy among the 
Lamanites that I might spy out their 
forces, that our army might come 
upon them and destroy them—but 
when  I  saw  that  which  was  good 
among  them  I  was  desirous  that 
they should not be destroyed.

92 Therefore,  I  contended  with  my 
brethren in the wilderness, for I would 
that our ruler should make a treaty 
with them; but he being an austere 
and a blood-thirsty man commanded 
that I should be slain; but I was res-
cued by the shedding of much blood; 
for father fought against father, and 
brother  against  brother,  until  the 
greater number of our army was de-
stroyed in the wilderness; and we re-
turned, those of us that were spared, 
to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that 
tale to their wives and their children.
3 And  yet,  I  being  a over-zealous 
to inherit the land of our fathers, 
collected as many as were desirous 
to  go  up  to  possess  the  land,  and 
started again on our b journey into 
the wilderness to go up to the land; 
but we were smitten with famine 
and  sore  afflictions;  for  we  were 
slow to remember the Lord our God.
4 Nevertheless,  after  many  days’ 
wandering  in  the  wilderness  we 
pitched our tents in the place where 
our brethren were slain, which was 
near to the land of our fathers.
