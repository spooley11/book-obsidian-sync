ye  are  weary  he  waketh  morning 
by morning. He waketh mine ear 
to hear as the learned.

5 The Lord God hath opened mine 
a ear, and I was not rebellious, nei-
ther turned away back.

6 I  gave  my  back  to  the  a smiter, 
and my cheeks to them that plucked 
off the hair. I hid not my face from 
b shame and spitting.

7 For the Lord God will help me, 
therefore shall I not be confounded. 
Therefore have I set my face like 
a flint, and I know that I shall not 
be a ashamed.

8 And the Lord is near, and he a jus-
tifieth me. Who will contend with 
me? Let us stand together. Who is 
mine adversary ? Let him come near 
me, and I will b smite him with the 
strength of my mouth.

9 For the Lord God will help me. 
And all they who shall  a condemn 
me, behold, all they shall b wax old 
as  a  garment,  and  the  moth  shall 
eat them up.

10 Who is among you that feareth 
the Lord, that obeyeth the a voice of 
his servant, that b walketh in dark-
ness and hath no light?

11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, 
that compass yourselves about with 
sparks,  walk  in  the  light  of  a your 
fire and in the sparks which ye have 
kindled. b This shall ye have of mine 
hand—ye shall lie down in sorrow.

CHAPTER 8

Jacob continues reading from Isaiah: 
In the last days, the Lord will comfort 
Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed

will  come  to  Zion  amid  great  joy—
Compare Isaiah 51 and 52:1–2. About 
559–545 b.c.
a Hearken unto me, ye that follow 
after righteousness. Look unto the 
b rock from whence ye are hewn, and 
to the hole of the pit from whence 
ye are digged.

2 Look unto Abraham, your a father, 
and unto b Sarah, she that bare you; 
for I called him alone, and blessed 
him.
