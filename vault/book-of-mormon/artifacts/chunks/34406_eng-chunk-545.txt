4 Now, as Alma was teaching and 
speaking unto the people upon the 
hill  a Onidah,  there  came  a  great 
b multitude  unto  him,  who  were 
those of whom we have been speak-
ing, of whom were c poor in heart, 
because of their poverty as to the 
things of the world.

5 And they came unto Alma; and 
the one who was the foremost among 
them said unto him: Behold, a what 
shall these my brethren do, for they 
are b despised of all men because of

their poverty, yea, and more espe-
cially by our priests; for they have  
c cast us out of our synagogues which 
we have labored abundantly to build 
with our own hands; and they have 
cast us out because of our exceed-
ing poverty; and we have d no place 
to  worship  our  God;  and  behold, 
e what shall we do?

6 And  now  when  Alma  heard 
this, he turned him about, his face 
immediately towards him, and he 
beheld  with  great  joy;  for  he  be-
held  that  their  a afflictions  had 
truly  b humbled  them,  and  that 
they were in a c preparation to hear  
the word.

7 Therefore he did say no more to  
the other multitude; but he stretched 
forth his hand, and cried unto those 
whom he beheld, who were truly 
penitent, and said unto them:

8 I  behold  that  ye  are  a lowly  in

heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

9 Behold  thy  brother  hath  said, 
What shall we do?—for we are cast 
out of our synagogues, that we can-
not worship our God.

10 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  do  ye  
suppose  that  ye  a cannot  worship  
God save it be in your synagogues 
only ?

11 And moreover, I would ask, do 
ye suppose that ye must not worship 
God only a once in a week?

12 I say unto you, it is well that ye  
are cast out of your synagogues, that 
ye may be humble, and that ye may 
learn  a wisdom; for it is necessary 
that  ye  should  learn  wisdom;  for 
it  is  because  that  ye  are  cast  out,  
that ye are despised of your brethren 
because of your exceeding b poverty, 
that ye are brought to a lowliness of 
heart; for ye are necessarily brought 
to be humble.
