unto them that are under condem-

broken law.

tance  is  b baptism;  and  baptism 
cometh by faith unto the fulfilling 
the commandments; and the fulfill-
ing  the  commandments  bringeth 
c remission of sins;

26 And  the  remission  of  sins 
bringeth a meekness, and lowliness 
of heart; and because of meekness 
and lowliness of heart cometh the

visitation of the b Holy Ghost, which 
c Comforter d filleth with hope and 
perfect e love, which love endureth 
by f diligence unto g prayer, until the 
end shall come, when all the h saints 
shall dwell with God.

27 Behold,  my  son,  I  will  write 
unto you again if I go not out soon 
against the Lamanites. Behold, the 
a pride of this nation, or the people 
of the Nephites, hath proven their 
destruction  except  they  should  
repent.

28 Pray  for  them,  my  son,  that 
repentance may come unto them. 
But  behold,  I  fear  lest  the  Spirit 
hath  a ceased  b striving  with  them; 
and  in  this  part  of  the  land  they 
are  also  seeking  to  put  down  all 
power and authority which cometh 
from  God;  and  they  are  c denying 
the Holy Ghost.

29 And after rejecting so great a 
knowledge, my son, they must per-
ish soon, unto the fulfilling of the 
prophecies which were spoken by 
the prophets, as well as the words 
of our Savior himself.
