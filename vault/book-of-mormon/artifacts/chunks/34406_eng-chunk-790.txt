and the quakings of the earth did 
cease—for behold, they did last for 
about  the  space  of  a three  b hours; 
and  it  was  said  by  some  that  the 
time was greater; nevertheless, all 
these great and terrible things were 
done  in  about  the  space  of  three 
hours—and then behold, there was 
c darkness upon the face of the land.
20 And it came to pass that there 
was thick darkness upon all the face 
of the land, insomuch that the in-
habitants thereof who had not fallen  
could a feel the b vapor of darkness;
21 And there could be no light, be-

groanings of the people, because of
