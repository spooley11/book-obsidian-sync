10 And it came to pass as he began 
to expound these things unto them 
they were angry with him, and be-
gan to a mock him; and they would 
not hear the words which he spake.
11 Therefore,  when  he  saw  that 
they would not hear his words, he 
departed  out  of  their  synagogue, 
and came over to a village which 
was called Ani-Anti, and there he 
found Muloki preaching the word 
unto  them;  and  also  Ammah  and 
his brethren. And they contended 
with many about the word.

12 And it came to pass that they 
saw that the people would harden

taken and cast into a prison, and the 
remainder of them fled out of the 
land of Middoni unto the regions 
round about.

they  were  delivered  by  the  hand
