17 And it came to pass that Corom 
did that which was good in the sight 
of the Lord all his days; and he be-
gat many sons and daughters; and 
after he had seen many days he did 
pass away, even like unto the rest 
of  the  earth;  and  Kish  reigned  in  
his stead.

18 And it came to pass that Kish 
passed away also, and Lib reigned 
in his stead.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lib 
also did that which was good in the 
sight of the Lord. And in the days 
of Lib the a poisonous serpents were 
destroyed. Wherefore they did go 
into  the  land  southward,  to  hunt 
food for the people of the land, for 
the land was covered with animals 
of the forest. And Lib also himself 
became a great b hunter.

20 And they built a great city by

the  a narrow  neck  of  land,  by  the 
place where the sea divides the land.
21 And they did preserve the land 
a southward for a wilderness, to get 
game.  And  the  whole  face  of  the 
land northward was covered with 
inhabitants.

22 And  they  were  exceedingly 
a industrious, and they did buy and 
sell and b traffic one with another, 
that they might get gain.

23 And they did a work in all man-
ner of b ore, and they did make gold, 
and  silver,  and  c iron,  and  d brass, 
and all manner of metals; and they 
did dig it out of the earth; where-
fore, they did cast up mighty heaps 
of earth to get ore, of gold, and of 
silver, and of iron, and of copper. 
And they did e work all manner of  
fine work.

24 And they did have  a silks, and 
fine-twined  b linen;  and  they  did 
work all manner of c cloth, that they 
might clothe themselves from their 
nakedness.

25 And  they  did  make  all  man-
ner of tools to till the earth, both 
to plow and to sow, to reap and to 
hoe, and also to thrash.

26 And they did make all manner 
of tools with which they did work 
their beasts.

27 And they did make all manner 
of a weapons of war. And they did 
work all manner of work of exceed-
ingly curious workmanship.
