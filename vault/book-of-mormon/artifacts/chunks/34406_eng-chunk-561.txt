threatenings  against  them.  And 
now the people of Ammon did not 
fear their words; therefore they did 
not cast them out, but they did re-
ceive all the poor of the Zoramites 
that came over unto them; and they 
did a nourish them, and did clothe 
them, and did give unto them lands 
for their inheritance; and they did 
administer unto them according to 
their wants.

10 Now this did a stir up the Zoram-
ites to b anger against the people of 
Ammon, and they began to mix with 
the Lamanites and to stir them up 
also to anger against them.

11 And thus the Zoramites and the 
Lamanites began to make prepara-
tions for war against the people of Am- 
mon, and also against the Nephites.
12 And thus ended the seventeenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

13 And the people of Ammon de-
parted out of the land of Jershon, 
and came over into the land of Me-
lek, and gave place in the land of 
Jershon for the armies of the Neph-
ites, that they might contend with 
the armies of the Lamanites and the  
armies of the Zoramites; and thus 
commenced a war betwixt the La-
manites  and  the  Nephites,  in  the 
eighteenth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the  judges;  and  an  a account  shall 
be given of their wars hereafter.

14 And  Alma,  and  Ammon,  and 
their  brethren,  and  also  the  a two 
sons of Alma returned to the land 
of  Zarahemla,  after  having  been 
instruments  in  the  hands  of  God 
of bringing  b many of the  c Zoram-
ites to repentance; and as many as 
were  brought  to  repentance  were 
driven out of their land; but they 
have lands for their inheritance in 
the land of Jershon, and they have 
taken up arms to defend themselves,

and their wives, and children, and 
their lands.

15 Now Alma, being a grieved for 
the iniquity of his people, yea for the  
wars, and the bloodsheds, and the 
contentions  which  were  among 
them; and having been to declare 
the word, or sent to declare the word,  
among all the people in every city; 
and  seeing  that  the  hearts  of  the 
people began to wax hard, and that 
they began to be b offended because 
of  the  strictness  of  the  word,  his 
heart was exceedingly sorrowful.
