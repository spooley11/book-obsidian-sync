and  high  priesthood,  is  without 
beginning or end—

9 Thus they become a high priests 
forever, after the order of the Son, 
the Only Begotten of the Father, who 
is without beginning of days or end 
of years, who is full of b grace, equity,  
and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

10 Now, as I said concerning the 
holy  order,  or  this  a high  priest-
hood, there were many who were 
ordained and became high priests of 
God; and it was on account of their 
exceeding  b faith and  c repentance, 
and their righteousness before God, 
they choosing to repent and work 
righteousness rather than to perish;
11 Therefore they were called af-
ter this holy order, and were a sanc-
tified,  and  their  b garments  were 
washed  white  through  the  blood 
of the Lamb.

12 Now  they,  after  being  a sanc-
tified  by  the  b Holy  Ghost,  having 
their garments made white, being 
c pure and spotless before God, could 
not look upon d sin save it were with 
e abhorrence; and there were many, 
exceedingly great many, who were 
made pure and entered into the rest 
of the Lord their God.
