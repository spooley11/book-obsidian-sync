32 For behold, this a life is the time 
for men to  b prepare to meet God; 
yea, behold the day of c this life is 
the day for men to perform their 
d labors.

a witnesses, therefore, I beseech of 
you that ye do not b procrastinate the 
day of your  c repentance until the 
end; for after this day of life, which 
is given us to prepare for eternity, 
behold, if we do not improve our 
time while in this life, then cometh 
the  d night  of  e darkness  wherein 
there can be no labor performed.

34 Ye  cannot  say,  when  ye  are 
brought to that awful  a crisis, that 
I will repent, that I will return to 
my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for 
that same spirit which doth b possess 
your bodies at the time that ye go 
out of this life, that same spirit will 
have power to possess your body in 
that eternal world.

35 For behold, if ye have procras-
tinated the day of your repentance 
even until death, behold, ye have 
become a subjected to the spirit of 
the devil, and he doth b seal you his; 
therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath 
withdrawn from you, and hath no 
place  in  you,  and  the  devil  hath 
all power over you; and this is the 
final state of the wicked.

36 And  this  I  know,  because  the 
Lord hath said he dwelleth not in 
a unholy temples, but in the b hearts 
of the c righteous doth he dwell; yea, 
and he has also said that the righ-
teous  shall  sit  down  in  his  king-
dom, to go no more out; but their 
garments  should  be  made  white 
through the d blood of the Lamb.

33 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you  
before,  as  ye  have  had  so  many

37 And now, my beloved brethren, 
I desire that ye should remember
