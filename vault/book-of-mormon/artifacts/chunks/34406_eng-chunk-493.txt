12 And  he  also  told  him  all  the 
cause  of  his  tarrying  in  his  own 
kingdom, that he did not go unto 
his father to the feast which he had 
prepared.

13 And now when Lamoni had re-
hearsed unto him all these things, 
behold,  to  his  astonishment,  his 
father was angry with him, and said: 
Lamoni, thou art going to deliver 
these Nephites, who are sons of a 
liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; 
and now his children are also come 
amongst us that they may, by their 
cunning and their lyings, deceive 
us, that they again may rob us of 
our property.

14 Now the father of Lamoni com-
manded  him  that  he  should  slay 
Ammon  with  the  sword.  And  he 
also commanded him that he should 
not go to the land of Middoni, but 
that he should return with him to 
the land of a Ishmael.

15 But  Lamoni  said  unto  him:  I 
will not slay Ammon, neither will 
I return to the land of Ishmael, but 
I go to the land of Middoni that I 
may release the brethren of Ammon, 
for I know that they are just men 
and holy prophets of the true God.
16 Now when his father had heard 
these  words,  he  was  angry  with 
him,  and  he  drew  his  sword  that 
he might smite him to the earth.

17 But  Ammon  stood  forth  and 
said unto him: Behold, thou shalt 
not  slay  thy  son;  nevertheless,  it 
were a better that he should fall than 
thee, for behold, he has b repented 
of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall 
at this time, in thine anger, thy soul 
could not be saved.

18 And again, it is expedient that 
thou shouldst forbear; for if thou 
shouldst a slay thy son, he being an 
innocent man, his blood would cry 
from  the  ground  to  the  Lord  his 
God, for vengeance to come upon 
thee;  and  perhaps  thou  wouldst 
lose thy b soul.

19 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these words unto him, he answered 
him, saying: I know that if I should 
slay my son, that I should shed in-
nocent blood; for it is thou that hast 
sought to destroy him.

20 And he stretched forth his hand 
to slay Ammon. But Ammon with-
stood his blows, and also smote his 
arm that he could not use it.
