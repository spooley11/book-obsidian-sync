know that it is by b grace that we are 
saved, after all we can c do.

24 And,  notwithstanding  we  be-
lieve  in  Christ,  we  a keep  the  law 
of  Moses,  and  look  forward  with 
steadfastness unto Christ, until the 
law shall be fulfilled.

25 For, for this end was the  a law 
given; wherefore the law hath be-
come  b dead  unto  us,  and  we  are 
made alive in Christ because of our 
faith; yet we keep the law because 
of the commandments.

26 And we a talk of Christ, we re-
joice in Christ, we preach of Christ, 
we b prophesy of Christ, and we write 
according  to  our  prophecies,  that 
our  c children  may  know  to  what 
source they may look for a d remis-
sion of their sins.

27 Wherefore, we speak concern-
ing the law that our children may 
know the deadness of the law; and 
they, by knowing the deadness of 
the law, may look forward unto that 
life which is in Christ, and know for 
what end the law was given. And 
after the law is fulfilled in Christ, 
that  they  need  not  harden  their 
hearts  against  him  when  the  law 
ought to be done away.

28 And now behold, my people, ye 
are a a stiffnecked people; wherefore, 
I have spoken plainly unto you, that 
ye cannot misunderstand. And the 
words  which  I  have  spoken  shall 
stand as a b testimony against you; 
for they are sufficient to c teach any 
man  the  d right  way;  for  the  right 
way is to believe in Christ and deny 
him not; for by denying him ye also 
deny the prophets and the law.

29 And now behold, I say unto you 
that the right way is to believe in 
Christ, and deny him not; and Christ 
is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore 
ye must bow down before him, and 
a worship him with all your b might, 
mind, and strength, and your whole 
soul; and if ye do this ye shall in 
nowise be cast out.
