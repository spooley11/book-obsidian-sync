19 And  while  the  angel  spake 
these words, I beheld and saw that 
the seed of my brethren did con-
tend against my seed, according to 
the word of the angel; and because 
of  the  pride  of  my  seed,  and  the 
a temptations of the devil, I beheld 
that  the  seed  of  my  brethren  did 
b overpower the people of my seed.
20 And it came to pass that I be-
held,  and  saw  the  people  of  the 
seed of my brethren that they had 
overcome my seed; and they went 
forth in multitudes upon the face 
of the land.

21 And  I  saw  them  gathered  to-
gether in multitudes; and I saw a wars 
and rumors of wars among them; 
and in wars and rumors of wars I 
saw b many generations pass away.
22 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold  these  shall  a dwindle  in 
unbelief.

23 And it came to pass that I be-
held,  after  they  had  dwindled  in 
unbelief they became a a dark, and 
loathsome,  and  a  b filthy  people, 
full of c idleness and all manner of 
abominations.

CHAPTER 13
Nephi sees in vision the church of the 
devil  set  up  among  the  Gentiles,  the 
discovery and colonizing of America, 
the  loss  of  many  plain  and  precious 
parts of the Bible, the resultant state 
of  gentile  apostasy,  the  restoration  of 
the  gospel,  the  coming  forth  of  latter-
day  scripture,  and  the  building  up  of 
Zion. About 600–592 b.c.
