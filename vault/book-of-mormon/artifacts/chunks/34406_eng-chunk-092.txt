24 And it came to pass that we did 
begin to till the earth, and we be-
gan to plant seeds; yea, we did put 
all our a seeds into the earth, which 
we had brought from the land of 
Jerusalem. And it came to pass that 
they did grow exceedingly; where-
fore, we were blessed in abundance.
25 And it came to pass that we did 
find upon the land of promise, as 
we journeyed in the wilderness, that 
there were a beasts in the forests of 
every kind, both the cow and the 
ox, and the ass and the horse, and 
the goat and the wild goat, and all 
manner  of  wild  animals,  which 
were  for  the  use  of  men.  And  we 
did find all manner of b ore, both of 
c gold, and of silver, and of copper.

CHAPTER 19
Nephi makes plates of ore and records 
the  history  of  his  people—The  God 
of Israel will come six hundred years  
from  the  time  Lehi  left  Jerusalem— 
Nephi  tells  of  His  sufferings  and  
crucifixion—The Jews will be despised 
and scattered until the latter days, when 
they will return unto the Lord. About 
588–570 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Lord 
commanded  me,  wherefore  I  did 
make  plates  of  ore  that  I  might 
engraven  upon  them  the  a record 
of my people. And upon the plates 
which I made I did b engraven the 
record of my c father, and also our 
journeyings in the wilderness, and 
the  prophecies  of  my  father;  and 
also many of mine own prophecies 
have I engraven upon them.

when I made them that I should be
