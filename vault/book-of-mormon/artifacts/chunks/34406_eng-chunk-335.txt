11 And now I read unto you the 
remainder of the a commandments 
of God, for I perceive that they are 
not written in your hearts; I perceive 
that ye have studied and taught b in-
iquity the most part of your lives.
12 And  now,  ye  remember  that 
I  a said  unto  you:  Thou  shalt  not 
make unto thee any graven image, 
or any likeness of things which are  
in heaven above, or which are in the  
earth  beneath,  or  which  are  in  
the water under the earth.

13 And again: Thou shalt not a bow 
down thyself unto them, nor serve 
them; for I the Lord thy God am a 
jealous God, visiting the iniquities 
of  the  fathers  upon  the  children, 
unto the third and fourth genera-
tions of them that hate me;

14 And showing mercy unto thou-
sands of them that love me and keep 
my commandments.

15 Thou shalt not take the name 
of the Lord thy God in vain; for the 
Lord  will  not  hold  him  a guiltless 
that taketh his name in vain.

16 Remember the a sabbath day, to

keep it holy.

17 Six days shalt thou labor, and

do all thy work;

18 But  the  seventh  day,  the  sab-
bath  of  the  Lord  thy  God,  thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy  
son,  nor  thy  daughter,  thy  man- 
servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor  
thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is 
within thy gates;

19 For in a six days the Lord made 
heaven and earth, and the sea, and 
all that in them is; wherefore the 
Lord blessed the sabbath day, and 
hallowed it.

20 a Honor  thy  b father  and  thy 
mother, that thy days may be long 
upon the land which the Lord thy 
God giveth thee.

21 Thou shalt not a kill.
22 Thou shalt not commit  a adul-

tery. Thou shalt not b steal.

23 Thou shalt not bear a false wit-

ness against thy neighbor.

24 Thou shalt not a covet thy neigh-
bor’s  house,  thou  shalt  not  covet 
thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man- 
servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his  
ox, nor his ass, nor anything that 
is thy neighbor’s.
