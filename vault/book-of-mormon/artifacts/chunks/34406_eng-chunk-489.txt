of the king. And there came a mul-
titude, and to their astonishment, 
they beheld the king, and the queen, 
and their servants prostrate upon 
the earth, and they all lay there as 
though  they  were  dead;  and  they 
also  saw  Ammon,  and  behold,  he 
was a Nephite.

19 And now the people began to 
murmur among themselves; some 
saying that it was a great evil that 
had come upon them, or upon the 
king and his house, because he had 
suffered  that  the  Nephite  should 
a remain in the land.

20 But others rebuked them, say-
ing: The king hath brought this evil 
upon his house, because he slew his 
servants who had had their flocks 
scattered at the a waters of Sebus.

21 And  they  were  also  rebuked 
by those men who had stood at the 
waters of Sebus and a scattered the 
flocks which belonged to the king, 
for they were angry with Ammon 
because  of  the  number  which  he 
had slain of their brethren at the 
waters  of  Sebus,  while  defending 
the flocks of the king.

22 Now, one of them, whose brother 
had been a slain with the sword of 
Ammon, being exceedingly angry 
with Ammon, drew his sword and 
went forth that he might let it fall 
upon Ammon, to slay him; and as 
he  lifted  the  sword  to  smite  him, 
behold, he fell dead.

23 Now we see that Ammon could 
not be slain, for the a Lord had said 
unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare 
him, and it shall be unto him ac-
cording  to  thy  faith—therefore, 
Mosiah b trusted him unto the Lord.
24 And it came to pass that when 
the multitude beheld that the man 
had  fallen  dead,  who  lifted  the 
sword to slay Ammon,  a fear came 
upon them all, and they durst not 
put forth their hands to touch him

or any of those who had fallen; and 
they began to marvel again among 
themselves what could be the cause 
of this great power, or what all these 
things could mean.

25 And it came to pass that there 
were many among them who said 
that Ammon was the a Great Spirit, 
and others said he was sent by the 
Great Spirit;

26 But  others  rebuked  them  all, 
saying that he was a a monster, who 
had been sent from the Nephites to 
torment them.
