15 For behold, my brethren, it is 
given  unto  you  to  a judge,  that  ye 
may know good from evil; and the 
way to judge is as plain, that ye may 
know with a perfect knowledge, as 
the daylight is from the dark night.
16 For behold, the a Spirit of Christ 
is given to every b man, that he may 
c know  good  from  evil;  wherefore, 
I show unto you the way to judge; 
for  every  thing  which  inviteth  to 
do good, and to persuade to believe 
in Christ, is sent forth by the power 
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may 
know with a perfect knowledge it 
is of God.

17 But whatsoever thing persuad-
eth men to do a evil, and believe not 
in Christ, and deny him, and serve 
not  God,  then  ye  may  know  with  
a  perfect  knowledge  it  is  of  the  
devil;  for  after  this  manner  doth 
the devil work, for he persuadeth 
no man to do good, no, not one; nei-
ther do his angels; neither do they 
who subject themselves unto him.

18 And now, my brethren, seeing 
that  ye  know  the  a light  by  which 
ye  may  judge,  which  light  is  the 
light of Christ, see that ye do not 
judge  wrongfully;  for  with  that 
same b judgment which ye judge ye 
shall also be judged.

19 Wherefore,  I  beseech  of  you, 
brethren,  that  ye  should  search 
diligently  in  the  a light  of  Christ 
that ye may know good from evil; 
and if ye will lay hold upon every 
good thing, and condemn it not, ye 
certainly will be a b child of Christ.
20 And  now,  my  brethren,  how 
is it possible that ye can lay hold 
upon every good thing?

21 And now I come to that faith, 
of which I said I would speak; and 
I will tell you the way whereby ye 
may lay hold on every good thing.
22 For behold, God  a knowing all 
things, being from  b everlasting to 
everlasting, behold, he sent c angels 
to  minister  unto  the  children  of 
men,  to  make  manifest  concern-
ing  the  coming  of  Christ;  and  in 
Christ  there  should  come  every  
good thing.

23 And  God  also  declared  unto 
prophets, by his own mouth, that 
Christ should come.
