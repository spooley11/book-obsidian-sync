Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life—
He partakes of its fruit and desires his 
family to do likewise—He sees a rod of 
iron, a strait and narrow path, and the 
mists of darkness that enshroud men—
Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the 
fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse. 
About 600–592 b.c.
And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  had 
gathered  together  all  manner  of 
a seeds of every kind, both of grain 
of every kind, and also of the seeds 
of fruit of every kind.

2 And it came to pass that while 
my father tarried in the wilderness 
he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I 
have a dreamed a dream; or, in other 
words, I have b seen a c vision.

3 And behold, because of the thing 
which I have seen, I have reason to 
rejoice in the Lord because of a Nephi 
and also of Sam; for I have reason 
to suppose that they, and also many 
of their seed, will be saved.

4 But behold, a Laman and Lemuel, 
I fear exceedingly because of you; 
for behold, methought I saw in my  
dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.
5 And it came to pass that I saw 
a  a man,  and  he  was  dressed  in  a 
white b robe; and he came and stood 
before me.

6 And it came to pass that he spake 
unto me, and bade me follow him.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  as  I 
followed him I beheld myself that 
I was in a dark and dreary waste.

8 And after I had traveled for the 
space of many hours in darkness, I 
began to pray unto the Lord that he 
would have a mercy on me, accord-
ing to the multitude of his tender 
mercies.

9 And it came to pass after I had 
prayed  unto  the  Lord  I  beheld  a 
large and spacious a field.

10 And it came to pass that I beheld 
a a tree, whose b fruit was desirable 
to make one c happy.

11 And it came to pass that I did 
go forth and partake of the  a fruit 
thereof; and I beheld that it was most 
sweet, above all that I ever before 
tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the 
fruit thereof was white, to exceed 
all the  b whiteness that I had ever  
seen.
