ALMA 39  : 15–40  : 8

15 And now, my son, I would say 
somewhat unto you concerning the 
a coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto 
you, that it is he that surely shall 
come to take away the sins of the 
world; yea, he cometh to declare glad  
tidings of salvation unto his people.
16 And now, my son, this was the 
ministry unto which ye were called, 
to declare these glad tidings unto 
this people, to prepare their minds; 
or rather that salvation might come 
unto them, that they may prepare 
the  minds  of  their  a children  to 
hear  the  word  at  the  time  of  his  
coming.

17 And now I will ease your mind 
somewhat on this subject. Behold, 
you marvel why these things should 
be known so long beforehand. Be-
hold, I say unto you, is not a soul 
at this time as precious unto God 
as a soul will be at the time of his 
coming?

18 Is it not as necessary that the 
plan of redemption should be a made 
known unto this people as well as 
unto their children?

19 Is it not as easy at this time for 
the Lord to  a send his angel to de-
clare these glad tidings unto us as 
unto  our  children,  or  as  after  the 
time of his coming?
