20 And  in  the  days  of  Coriantor 
there  also  came  many  prophets, 
and prophesied of great and mar-
velous things, and cried repentance 
unto  the  people,  and  except  they 
should repent the Lord God would 
execute a judgment against them to 
their utter destruction;

21 And that the Lord God would 
send or bring forth  a another peo-
ple  to  possess  the  b land,  by  his 
power, after the manner by which 
he brought their fathers.

22 And  they  did  a reject  all  the 
words of the prophets, because of 
their  b secret  society  and  wicked 
abominations.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tor begat a Ether, and he died, hav-
ing dwelt in captivity all his days.

CHAPTER 12
The  prophet  Ether  exhorts  the  people 
to believe in God—Moroni recounts the 
wonders and marvels done by faith—
Faith  enabled  the  brother  of  Jared  to 
see Christ—The Lord gives men weak-
ness  that  they  may  be  humble—The 
brother  of  Jared  moved  Mount  Zerin 
by faith—Faith, hope, and charity are 
essential  to  salvation—Moroni  saw 
Jesus face to face.

And it came to pass that the days 
of Ether were in the days of a Cori-
antumr; and Coriantumr was king 
over all the land.

Lord; wherefore Ether came forth

in the days of Coriantumr, and be-
gan to prophesy unto the people, 
for  he  could  not  be  b restrained 
because  of  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord 
which was in him.

unto them that d by e faith all things
