16 And  they  have  been  a handed 
down  from  one  generation  to  an-
other  by  the  Nephites,  even  until 
they have fallen into transgression 
and  have  been  murdered,  plun-
dered, and hunted, and driven forth, 
and slain, and b scattered upon the 
face of the earth, and mixed with 
the  Lamanites  until  they  are  c no 
more called the Nephites, becoming 
wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, 
even becoming Lamanites.

17 And now I return again to mine 
account; therefore, what I have spo-
ken had passed after there had been

great contentions, and disturbances, 
and wars, and dissensions, among 
the people of Nephi.

18 The forty and sixth year of the

reign of the judges ended;

19 And it came to pass that there 
was  still  great  contention  in  the 
land,  yea,  even  in  the  forty  and 
seventh year, and also in the forty 
and eighth year.

20 Nevertheless a Helaman did fill 
the judgment-seat with justice and 
equity; yea, he did observe to keep 
the  statutes,  and  the  judgments,  
and the commandments of God; and 
he did do that which was right in 
the sight of God continually; and 
he did walk after the ways of his

21 And it came to pass that he had 
two sons. He gave unto the eldest  
the name of a Nephi, and unto the 
youngest, the name of Lehi. And they  
began to grow up unto the Lord.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
wars  and  contentions  began  to 
cease,  in  a  small  degree,  among 
the people of the Nephites, in the 
latter end of the forty and eighth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

23 And it came to pass in the forty 
and ninth year of the reign of the 
judges, there was continual peace 
established in the land, all save it 
were the a secret combinations which 
b Gadianton  the  robber  had  estab-
lished in the more settled parts of 
the land, which at that time were not 
known unto those who were at the  
head of government; therefore they 
were not destroyed out of the land.
24 And it came to pass that in this 
same  year  there  was  exceedingly 
great prosperity in the church, in-
somuch that there were thousands 
who did a join themselves unto the
