5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I 
had not been a born of God I should 
b not have known these things; but 
God has, by the mouth of his holy 
c angel,  made  these  things  known 
unto  me,  not  of  any  d worthiness 
of myself;

6 For I went about with the sons 
of Mosiah, seeking to a destroy the 
church of God; but behold, God sent 
his holy angel to stop us by the way.
7 And behold, he spake unto us, 
as  it  were  the  voice  of  thunder, 
and the whole earth did  a tremble 
beneath our feet; and we all fell to 
the earth, for the b fear of the Lord 
came upon us.

8 But behold, the voice said unto 
me:  Arise.  And  I  arose  and  stood 
up, and beheld the angel.

9 And  he  said  unto  me:  If  thou 
wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no 
more to destroy the church of God.
10 And it came to pass that I fell to

the earth; and it was for the space 
of  a three  days  and  three  nights  
that  I  could  not  open  my  mouth, 
neither had I the use of my limbs.
11 And  the  angel  spake  more 
things unto me, which were heard 
by my brethren, but I did a not hear 
them; for when I heard the words—
If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, 
seek no more to destroy the church 
of God—I was struck with such great 
fear and amazement lest perhaps I 
should be destroyed, that I fell to 
the earth and I did hear no more.

12 But I was racked with a eternal 
b torment, for my soul was c harrowed 
up to the greatest degree and racked 
with all my sins.

13 Yea, I did remember all my sins 
and iniquities, for which I was a tor-
mented with the b pains of hell; yea, 
I  saw  that  I  had  c rebelled  against 
my God, and that I had not kept his 
holy commandments.

14 Yea, and I had a murdered many 
of his children, or rather led them 
away unto destruction; yea, and in 
fine so great had been my iniqui-
ties, that the very thought of com-
ing  into  the  presence  of  my  God 
did rack my soul with inexpressible  
horror.
