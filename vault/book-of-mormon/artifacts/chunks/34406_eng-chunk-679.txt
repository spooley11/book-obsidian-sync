15 Therefore, come unto me speed-
ily  with  a  few  of  your  men,  and 
leave the remainder in the charge 
of  Lehi  and  Teancum;  give  unto 
them power to conduct the a war in 
that part of the land, according to 
the b Spirit of God, which is also the 
c spirit of freedom which is in them.
16 Behold I have sent a few provi-
sions unto them, that they may not 
perish until ye can come unto me.
17 Gather  together  whatsoever 
force ye can upon your march hither, 
and  we  will  go  speedily  against 
those  dissenters,  in  the  strength 
of our God according to the faith  
which is in us.

18 And we will a take possession of 
the city of Zarahemla, that we may 
obtain more food to send forth unto 
Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go 
forth against them in the strength 
of the Lord, and we will put an end 
to this great iniquity.

19 And  now,  Moroni,  I  do  joy  in 
receiving  your  epistle,  for  I  was 
somewhat worried concerning what 
we should do, whether it should be 
just in us to go against our brethren.
20 But ye have said, except they 
repent the Lord a hath commanded 
you that ye should go against them.
21 See that ye a strengthen Lehi and 
Teancum in the Lord; tell them to 
fear not, for God will deliver them, 
yea, and also all those who b stand 
fast in that liberty wherewith God 
hath  made  them  free.  And  now  I 
close  mine  epistle  to  my  beloved 
brother, Moroni.
