25 But it came to pass that Amalick-
iah would not suffer the Lamanites 
to go against the city of Nephihah 
to battle, but kept them down by 
the seashore, leaving men in every 
city to maintain and defend it.

26 And  thus  he  went  on,  taking 
possession of a many cities, the city 
of b Nephihah, and the city of  c Lehi, 
and  the  city  of  d Morianton,  and 
the city of Omner, and the city of 
e Gid, and the city of f  Mulek, all of

which were on the east borders by 
the seashore.

27 And  thus  had  the  Lamanites 
obtained, by the cunning of Amal-
ickiah,  so  many  cities,  by  their 
numberless hosts, all of which were 
strongly fortified after the manner 
of the a fortifications of Moroni; all 
of which afforded strongholds for 
the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that they 
marched to the a borders of the land 
Bountiful, driving the Nephites be-
fore them and slaying many.

29 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were  met  by  Teancum,  who  had 
a slain Morianton and had b headed 
his people in his flight.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
headed Amalickiah also, as he was 
marching forth with his numerous 
army that he might take possession 
of the land Bountiful, and also the 
land a northward.

31 But behold he met with a dis-
appointment  by  being  repulsed 
by Teancum and his men, for they 
were great warriors; for every man 
of  Teancum  did  exceed  the  La-
manites  in  their  strength  and  in 
their  skill  of  war,  insomuch  that 
they  did  gain  advantage  over  the  
Lamanites.

32 And it came to pass that they 
did  harass  them,  insomuch  that  
they did slay them even until it was 
dark. And it came to pass that Te-
ancum and his men did pitch their 
tents  in  the  borders  of  the  land  
Bountiful;  and  Amalickiah  did 
pitch  his  tents  in  the  borders  on 
the beach by the seashore, and after  
this manner were they driven.

33 And it came to pass that when 
the night had come, Teancum and 
his servant stole forth and went out 
by night, and went into the camp 
of  Amalickiah;  and  behold,  sleep
