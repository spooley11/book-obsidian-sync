13 Nevertheless he cried again, say-
ing: Alma, arise and stand forth, for 
why persecutest thou the church of 
God? For the Lord hath said: a This 
is my church, and I will establish 
it;  and  nothing  shall  b overthrow 
it,  save  it  is  the  transgression  of  
my people.

14 And  again,  the  angel  said:  
Behold,  the  Lord  hath  a heard  the  
prayers  of  his  people,  and  also  
the  b prayers of his servant, Alma, 
who is thy father; for he has c prayed 
with  much  faith  concerning  thee 
that  thou  mightest  be  brought  to 
the d knowledge of the truth; there-
fore, for this purpose have I come 
to e convince thee of the power and 
authority of God, that the f prayers 
of his servants might be answered 
according to their faith.

15 And  now  behold,  can  ye  dis-
pute  the  power  of  God?  For  be-
hold, doth not my voice shake the 
earth?  And  can  ye  not  also  a be-
hold me before you? And I am sent  
from God.

16 Now  I  say  unto  thee:  Go,  and

remember  the  captivity  of  thy 
fathers in the land of a Helam, and 
in the land of Nephi; and remember 
how great things he has done for 
them;  for  they  were  in  b bondage, 
and  he  has  c delivered  them.  And 
now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy 
way, and seek to destroy the church 
no more, that their prayers may be 
answered, and this even if thou wilt 
of d thyself be e cast off.

17 And now it came to pass that 
these  were  the  last  words  which 
the  angel  spake  unto  Alma,  and 
he departed.

18 And now Alma and those that 
were  with  him  fell  again  to  the 
earth,  for  great  was  their  aston-
ishment;  for  with  their  own  eyes 
they  had  beheld  an  a angel  of  the 
Lord; and his voice was as thunder, 
which  b shook  the  earth;  and  they 
knew that there was nothing save 
the power of God that could shake 
the  earth  and  cause  it  to  tremble 
as though it would part asunder.
