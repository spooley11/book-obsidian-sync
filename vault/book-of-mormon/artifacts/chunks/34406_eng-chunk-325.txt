And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon 
Noah,  one  of  his  sons;  therefore 
Noah began to reign in his stead; 
and he did not walk in the ways of 
his father.

2 For behold, he did not keep the 
commandments of God, but he did 
walk  after  the  desires  of  his  own 
heart. And he had many wives and 
a concubines. And he did b cause his 
people to commit sin, and do that 
which was c abominable in the sight 
of the Lord. Yea, and they did com-
mit d whoredoms and e all manner of 
wickedness.

3 And he laid a  a tax of one fifth 
part of all they possessed, a fifth part  
of  their  gold  and  of  their  silver,

and a fifth part of their b ziff, and 
of their copper, and of their brass 
and their iron; and a fifth part of 
their fatlings; and also a fifth part 
of all their grain.

4 And all this did he take to a sup-
port himself, and his wives and his 
b concubines;  and  also  his  priests, 
and  their  wives  and  their  concu-
bines; thus he had changed the af-
fairs of the kingdom.

5 For he put down all the priests 
that  had  been  consecrated  by  his 
father, and consecrated new a ones 
in their stead, such as were lifted 
up in the pride of their hearts.

6 Yea,  and  thus  they  were  sup-
ported in their laziness, and in their 
idolatry, and in their whoredoms, 
by the taxes which king Noah had 
put upon his people; thus did the 
people  labor  exceedingly  to  sup-
port iniquity.
