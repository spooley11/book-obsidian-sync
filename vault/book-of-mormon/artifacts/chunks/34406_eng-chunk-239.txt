30 For if I will, saith the Lord of 
Hosts, raise up a seed unto me, I will 
command  my  people;  otherwise 
they shall hearken unto these things.
31 For  behold,  I,  the  Lord,  have 
seen  the  sorrow,  and  heard  the 
mourning of the daughters of my 
people  in  the  land  of  Jerusalem, 
yea, and in all the lands of my peo-
ple, because of the wickedness and 
a abominations of their b husbands.
32 And I will not suffer, saith the 
Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the 
fair daughters of this people, which 
I have led out of the land of Jerusa-
lem, shall come up unto me against 
the  men  of  my  people,  saith  the 
Lord of Hosts.

33 For  they  shall  not  lead  away 
captive the daughters of my people 
because of their tenderness, save I 
shall visit them with a sore curse, 
even  unto  destruction;  for  they 
shall not commit a whoredoms, like

unto  them  of  old,  saith  the  Lord  
of Hosts.

34 And now behold, my brethren, 
ye know that these commandments 
were  given  to  our  a father,  Lehi; 
wherefore, ye have known them be-
fore; and ye have come unto great 
condemnation;  for  ye  have  done 
these  things  which  ye  ought  not 
to have done.
