43 And now, after all these things, 
the time has come that they have 
become  wicked,  yea,  nearly  unto 
ripeness; and I know not but they are 
at this day about to be a destroyed; 
for I know that the day must surely 
come that they must be destroyed, 
save a few only, who shall be led 
away into captivity.

44 Wherefore,  the  Lord  a com-
manded my father that he should 
depart into the wilderness; and the 
Jews also sought to take away his 
life; yea, and b ye also have sought 
to take away his life; wherefore, ye 
are murderers in your hearts and 
ye are like unto them.

45 Ye are a swift to do iniquity but 
slow  to  remember  the  Lord  your 
God. Ye have seen an b angel, and he 
spake unto you; yea, ye have heard 
his voice from time to time; and he 
hath spoken unto you in a still small 
voice, but ye were c past feeling, that 
ye could not feel his words; where-
fore, he has spoken unto you like 
unto  the  voice  of  thunder,  which 
did cause the earth to shake as if 
it were to divide asunder.

46 And ye also know that by the

a power of his almighty word he can 
cause  the  earth  that  it  shall  pass  
away; yea, and ye know that by his  
word he can cause the rough places to  
be made smooth, and smooth places 
shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, 
that ye can be so hard in your hearts?
47 Behold,  my  soul  is  rent  with  
anguish  because  of  you,  and  my 
heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall 
be cast off forever. Behold, I am a full 
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that 
my frame has b no strength.
