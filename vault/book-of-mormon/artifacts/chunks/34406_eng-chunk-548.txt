exercise a particle of faith, yea, even 
if ye can no more than  a desire to 
believe, let this desire work in you, 
even until ye believe in a manner 
that ye can give place for a portion 
of my words.

28 Now, we will compare the word  
unto a a seed. Now, if ye give place, 
that a b seed may be planted in your 
c heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or 
a good seed, if ye do not cast it out 
by your d unbelief, that ye will resist 
the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will 
begin to swell within your breasts; 
and  when  you  feel  these  swell-
ing  motions,  ye  will  begin  to  say  
within yourselves—It must needs be  
that this is a good seed, or that the 
word is good, for it beginneth to en-
large my soul; yea, it beginneth to 
e enlighten my f understanding, yea, 
it beginneth to be delicious to me.
29 Now behold, would not this in-
crease your faith? I say unto you, 
Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown 
up to a perfect knowledge.

30 But behold, as the seed swell-
eth, and sprouteth, and beginneth 
to grow, then you must needs say 
that the seed is good; for behold it 
swelleth, and sprouteth, and begin-
neth to grow. And now, behold, will 
not this strengthen your faith? Yea, 
it will strengthen your faith: for ye 
will say I know that this is a good 
seed;  for  behold  it  sprouteth  and 
beginneth to grow.

31 And now, behold, are ye sure 
that this is a good seed? I say unto 
you,  Yea;  for  every  seed  bringeth 
forth unto its own a likeness.

32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it 
is good, but if it groweth not, be-
hold it is not good, therefore it is  
cast away.

33 And  now,  behold,  because  ye 
have  tried  the  experiment,  and 
planted  the  seed,  and  it  swelleth

and  sprouteth,  and  beginneth  to 
grow, ye must needs know that the 
seed is good.
