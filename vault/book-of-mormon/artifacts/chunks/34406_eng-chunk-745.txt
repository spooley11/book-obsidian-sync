HELAMAN 13  : 20–28

unto me; and cursed be they who 
hide not up their treasures unto me; 
for none hideth up their treasures 
unto me save it be the righteous; and 
he that hideth not up his treasures 
unto me, cursed is he, and also the 
treasure, and none shall redeem it 
because of the curse of the land.

20 And  the  day  shall  come  that 
they shall hide up their treasures, 
because they have set their hearts 
upon riches; and because they have 
set their hearts upon their riches, 
and  will  hide  up  their  treasures 
when  they  shall  flee  before  their 
enemies;  because  they  will  not 
hide them up unto me, cursed be 
they and also their treasures; and 
in that day shall they be smitten, 
saith the Lord.

21 Behold  ye,  the  people  of  this 
great  city,  and  hearken  unto  my 
words; yea, hearken unto the words 
which the Lord saith; for behold, he 
saith  that  ye  are  a cursed  because 
of  your  riches,  and  also  are  your 
riches cursed because ye have set 
your hearts upon them, and have 
not b hearkened unto the words of 
him who gave them unto you.

22 Ye do not remember the Lord 
your God in the things with which 
he hath blessed you, but ye do al-
ways remember your a riches, not to 
thank the Lord your God for them; 
yea, your hearts are not drawn out 
unto  the  Lord,  but  they  do  swell 
with  great  pride,  unto  b boasting, 
and  unto  great  c swelling,  d envy-
ings, strifes, malice, persecutions, 
and  murders,  and  all  manner  of  
iniquities.

23 For  this  cause  hath  the  Lord 
God caused that a curse should come 
upon the land, and also upon your

riches,  and  this  because  of  your  
iniquities.

24 Yea,  wo  unto  this  people,  be-
cause of this time which has arrived, 
that ye do  a cast out the prophets, 
and do mock them, and cast stones 
at them, and do slay them, and do 
all manner of iniquity unto them, 
even as they did of old time.

25 And now when ye talk, ye say: 
If our days had been in the days of 
our  a fathers  of  old,  we  would  not 
have b slain the prophets; we would 
not  have  stoned  them,  and  cast  
them out.
