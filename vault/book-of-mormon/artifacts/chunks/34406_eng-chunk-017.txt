17 But I shall make an account of 
my proceedings in my days. Behold, 
I make an a abridgment of the record 
of my b father, upon c plates which I 
have made with mine own hands; 
wherefore,  after  I  have  abridged 
the record of my d father then will I 
make an account of mine own life.
18 Therefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should know, that after the Lord had 
shown  so  many  marvelous  things 
unto my father, Lehi, yea, concern-
ing the a destruction of Jerusalem, 
behold  he  went  forth  among  the 
people,  and  began  to  b prophesy 
and to declare unto them concern-
ing the things which he had both 
seen and heard.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a Jews did b mock him because of the 
things which he testified of them; 
for he truly testified of their c wick-
edness and their abominations; and 
he testified that the things which he 
saw and heard, and also the things 
which he read in the book, mani-
fested  plainly  of  the  coming  of  a 
d Messiah, and also the redemption 
of the world.

20 And when the Jews heard these 
things they were angry with him; 
yea, even as with the prophets of 
old, whom they had a cast out, and 
stoned,  and  slain;  and  they  also 
b sought  his  life,  that  they  might 
take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, 
will show unto you that the tender 
c mercies  of  the  Lord  are  over  all

those  whom  he  hath  chosen,  be-
cause of their faith, to make them 
mighty  even  unto  the  power  of  
d deliverance.

CHAPTER 2
Lehi takes his family into the wilder-
ness by the Red Sea—They leave their 
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the 
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the 
commandments—Laman and Lemuel 
murmur against their father—Nephi is 
obedient and prays in faith; the Lord 
speaks to him, and he is chosen to rule 
over his brethren. About 600 b.c.
For  behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
the Lord spake unto my father, yea, 
even in a dream, and said unto him: 
Blessed  art  thou  Lehi,  because  of 
the  things  which  thou  hast  done; 
and because thou hast been faithful 
and declared unto this people the 
things  which  I  commanded  thee, 
behold,  they  seek  to  a take  away  
thy b life.
