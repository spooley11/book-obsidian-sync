2 And then shall the  a wicked be 
b cast out, and they shall have cause 
to howl, and c weep, and wail, and 
gnash their teeth; and this because 
they would not d hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord 
redeemeth them not.

3 For they are a carnal and devilish, 
and the devil has power over them; 
yea, even that old serpent that did

b beguile our first parents, which was  
the  c cause  of  their  fall;  which  
was the cause of d all mankind be-
coming  carnal,  sensual,  devilish, 
e knowing evil from good, f subject-
ing themselves to the devil.

4 Thus  all  mankind  were  a lost; 
and behold, they would have been 
endlessly lost were it not that God 
redeemed his people from their lost 
and fallen state.

5 But remember that he that per-
sists in his own a carnal nature, and 
goes on in the ways of sin and re-
bellion against God, remaineth in 
his fallen state and the b devil hath 
all  power  over  him.  Therefore  he 
is as though there was no c redemp-
tion made, being an enemy to God; 
and  also  is  the  d devil  an  enemy  
to God.

6 And now if Christ had not come 
into the world, speaking of things to 
come a as though they had already 
come,  there  could  have  been  no 
redemption.

7 And if Christ had not risen from 
the dead, or have broken the bands 
of death that the grave should have 
no victory, and that death should 
have  no  a sting,  there  could  have 
been no resurrection.

8 But there is a a resurrection, there-
fore the grave hath no victory, and 
the  sting  of  b death  is  swallowed  
up in Christ.

9 He is the a light and the life of the 
world; yea, a light that is endless,
