he was about his a own life; never-
theless, Gideon did spare his life.

9 And  the  king  commanded  the 
people  that  they  should  flee  be-
fore the Lamanites, and he himself 
did go before them, and they did 
flee into the wilderness, with their 
women and their children.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  did  pursue  them,  and 
did  overtake  them,  and  began  to 
slay them.

11 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king commanded them that all the 
men should a leave their wives and 
their children, and flee before the 
Lamanites.

12 Now  there  were  many  that 
would  not  leave  them,  but  had 
rather stay and perish with them. 
And  the  rest  left  their  wives  and 
their children and fled.

13 And it came to pass that those 
who tarried with their wives and 
their children caused that their fair 
daughters should stand forth and 
plead with the Lamanites that they 
would not slay them.

14 And it came to pass that the La-
manites had compassion on them, 
for  they  were  charmed  with  the 
beauty of their women.

15 Therefore  the  Lamanites  did 
spare  their  lives,  and  took  them 
captives  and  carried  them  back 
to the land of Nephi, and granted 
unto them that they might possess 
the land, under the conditions that 
they would deliver up king Noah 
into the hands of the Lamanites, and 
deliver up their property, even a one 
half of all they possessed, one half 
of their gold, and their silver, and 
all their precious things, and thus 
they should pay tribute to the king 
of the Lamanites from year to year.
16 And now there was one of the 
sons of the king among those that 
were  taken  captive,  whose  name 
was a Limhi.
