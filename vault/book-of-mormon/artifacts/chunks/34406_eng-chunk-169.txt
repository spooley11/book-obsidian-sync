4 What  could  have  been  done 
more  to  my  vineyard  that  I  have 
not  done  in  it?  Wherefore,  when 
I looked that it should bring forth 
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.
5 And  now  go  to;  I  will  tell  you 
what  I  will  do  to  my  vineyard—I 
will a take away the hedge thereof, 
and it shall be eaten up; and I will 
break down the wall thereof, and 
it shall be trodden down;

6 And I will lay it waste; it shall 
not be pruned nor digged; but there 
shall come up a briers and thorns; I 
will also command the clouds that 
they b rain no rain upon it.

7 For the a vineyard of the Lord of 
Hosts is the house of Israel, and the 
men  of  Judah  his  pleasant  plant; 
and he looked for b judgment, and 
behold, c oppression; for righteous-
ness, but behold, a cry.

8 Wo unto them that join a house 
to house, till there can be no place, 
that they may be placed alone in 
the midst of the earth!

9 In  mine  ears,  said  the  Lord  of 
Hosts, of a truth many houses shall 
be desolate, and great and fair cit-
ies without inhabitant.

10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall 
yield one a bath, and the seed of a 
homer shall yield an ephah.

11 Wo  unto  them  that  rise  up 
early in the morning, that they may 
a follow strong drink, that continue 
until  night,  and  b wine  inflame  
them!

12 And the harp, and the a viol, the 
tabret, and pipe, and wine are in 
their  feasts;  but  they  b regard  not
