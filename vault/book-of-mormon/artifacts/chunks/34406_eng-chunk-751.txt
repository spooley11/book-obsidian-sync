18 Yea,  and  it  bringeth  to  pass 
the  condition  of  repentance,  that 
whosoever  repenteth  the  same  is 
not a hewn down and cast into the 
fire; but whosoever repenteth not is 
hewn down and cast into the fire; 
and there cometh upon them again 
a  b spiritual  death,  yea,  a  second 
death, for they are cut off again as to 
things pertaining to righteousness.
19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, 
lest  by  knowing  these  things  and 
not doing them ye shall suffer your-
selves to come under condemnation, 
and ye are brought down unto this 
second death.

20 But behold, as I said unto you 
concerning another a sign, a sign of 
his death, behold, in that day that 
he shall suffer death the sun shall 
be darkened and refuse to give his 
b light unto you; and also the moon 
and the stars; and there shall be no 
light upon the face of this land, even 
from the time that he shall suffer 
death, for the space of c three days, 
to the time that he shall rise again 
from the dead.

21 Yea,  at  the  time  that  he  shall 
yield up the  a ghost there shall be 
b thunderings and lightnings for the 
space of many hours, and the earth 
shall  shake  and  tremble;  and  the 
c rocks which are upon the face of 
this earth, which are both above the 
earth and beneath, which ye know  
at this time are solid, or the more

part of it is one solid mass, shall be 
d broken up;

22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain, 
and  shall  ever  after  be  a found  in 
seams  and  in  cracks,  and  in  bro-
ken fragments upon the face of the 
whole  earth,  yea,  both  above  the 
earth and beneath.

23 And  behold,  there  shall  be 
great a tempests, and there shall be 
many mountains laid low, like unto 
a valley, and there shall be many 
places which are now called  b val-
leys which shall become mountains, 
whose height is great.

24 And a many highways shall be 
broken  up,  and  many  cities  shall 
become desolate.

25 And  many  a graves  shall  be 
opened, and shall yield up many of 
their dead; and many saints shall 
appear unto many.
