4 Now behold, this was the desire 
of Amalickiah; for he being a very 
a subtle man to do evil therefore he 
laid  the  plan  in  his  heart  to  b de-
throne the king of the Lamanites.
5 And  now  he  had  got  the  com-
mand of those parts of the Laman-
ites who were in favor of the king; 
and he sought to gain favor of those 
who were not obedient; therefore 
he went forward to the place which 
was called a Onidah, for thither had 
all  the  Lamanites  fled;  for  they 
discovered the army coming, and, 
supposing that they were coming to 
destroy them, therefore they fled to 
Onidah, to the place of arms.

6 And they had appointed a man 
to be a king and a leader over them,  
being  fixed  in  their  minds  with  
a determined resolution that they 
would  a not  be  subjected  to  go 
against the Nephites.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
had gathered themselves together 
upon the top of the mount which 
was called Antipas, in preparation 
to battle.

8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s in-
tention to give them battle accord-
ing  to  the  commandments  of  the 
king; but behold, it was his inten-
tion to gain favor with the armies of 
the Lamanites, that he might place 
himself at their head and dethrone 
the king and take possession of the 
kingdom.

9 And behold, it came to pass that 
he caused his army to pitch their 
tents in the valley which was near 
the mount Antipas.

10 And it came to pass that when it 
was night he sent a secret embassy 
into  the  mount  Antipas,  desiring

that the leader of those who were 
upon the mount, whose name was 
Lehonti, that he should come down 
to the foot of the mount, for he de-
sired to speak with him.

11 And it came to pass that when 
Lehonti  received  the  message  he 
durst  not  go  down  to  the  foot  of 
the mount. And it came to pass that 
Amalickiah sent again the second 
time, desiring him to come down. 
And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lehonti 
would  not;  and  he  sent  again  the 
third time.
