32 Neither will the Lord God suf-
fer that the Gentiles shall forever 
remain in that awful state of blind-
ness, which thou beholdest they are 
in, because of the plain and most 
precious parts of the gospel of the 
Lamb which have been kept back 
by that a abominable church, whose 
formation thou hast seen.

33 Wherefore  saith  the  Lamb  of 
God:  I  will  be  a merciful  unto  the 
Gentiles,  unto  the  visiting  of  the 
remnant of the house of Israel in 
great judgment.

34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel of the Lord spake unto me, 
saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of 
God, after I have a visited the b rem-
nant  of  the  house  of  Israel—and 
this remnant of whom I speak is the 
seed of thy father—wherefore, after 
I  have  visited  them  in  judgment, 
and smitten them by the hand of 
the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles 
do  c stumble  exceedingly,  because 
of  the  most  plain  and  precious 
parts  of  the  d gospel  of  the  Lamb 
which have been kept back by that 
abominable  church,  which  is  the  
mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I 
will be merciful unto the e Gentiles 
in  that  day,  insomuch  that  I  will 
f  bring forth unto them, in mine own 
power, much of my g gospel, which 
shall be plain and precious, saith  
the Lamb.

35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I 
will manifest myself unto thy seed, 
that they shall write many things 
which I shall minister unto them, 
which shall be plain and precious; 
and  after  thy  seed  shall  be  de-
stroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, 
and also the seed of thy brethren, 
behold,  a these things shall be hid 
up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, 
by the gift and power of the Lamb.
36 And in them shall be written 
my a gospel, saith the Lamb, and my 
b rock and my salvation.

37 And a blessed are they who shall 
seek to bring forth my b Zion at that 
day, for they shall have the c gift and 
the d power of the Holy Ghost; and 
if they e endure unto the end they
