6 Therefore,  a wo  be  unto  the  
Gentiles if it so be that they harden

their  hearts  against  the  Lamb  of  
God.

7 For the time cometh, saith the 
Lamb  of  God,  that  I  will  work  a 
great and a a marvelous work among 
the children of men; a b work which 
shall be everlasting, either on the 
one  hand  or  on  the  other—either 
to  the  convincing  of  them  unto 
c peace and d life eternal, or unto the 
deliverance of them to the hardness 
of their hearts and the blindness of 
their minds unto their being brought 
down into captivity, and also into 
destruction,  both  temporally  and 
spiritually,  according  to  the  e cap-
tivity of the devil, of which I have 
spoken.

8 And it came to pass that when 
the angel had spoken these words, 
he said unto me: Rememberest thou  
the a covenants of the Father unto the  
house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.
9 And it came to pass that he said 
unto me: Look, and behold that great 
and abominable church, which is 
the mother of abominations, whose 
founder is the a devil.

10 And he said unto me: Behold 
there are save a two churches only; 
the one is the church of the Lamb 
of God, and the b other is the church 
of  the  c devil;  wherefore,  d whoso 
belongeth not to the church of the 
Lamb  of  God  belongeth  to  that 
great church, which is the mother 
of  abominations;  and  she  is  the 
e whore of all the earth.
