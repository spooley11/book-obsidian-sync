11 Yea, even if they should dwindle 
in unbelief the Lord shall a prolong 
their days, until the time shall come 
which hath been spoken of by our 
fathers,  and  also  by  the  prophet 
b Zenos, and many other prophets, 
concerning the c restoration of our 
brethren, the Lamanites, again to 
the knowledge of the truth—

12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the 
latter  times  the  a promises  of  the 
Lord  have  been  extended  to  our 
brethren, the Lamanites; and not-
withstanding the many afflictions 
which they shall have, and notwith-
standing  they  shall  be  b driven  to 
and fro upon the face of the earth, 
and be hunted, and shall be smit-
ten and scattered abroad, having no

place for c refuge, the Lord shall be 
d merciful unto them.

13 And  this  is  according  to  the 
prophecy, that they shall again be 
a brought  to  the  true  knowledge, 
which  is  the  knowledge  of  their 
Redeemer, and their great and true 
b shepherd, and be numbered among 
his c sheep.

14 Therefore  I  say  unto  you,  it 
shall be  a better for them than for 
you except ye repent.

15 For  behold,  a had  the  mighty 
works been shown unto them which 
have  been  shown  unto  you,  yea, 
unto them who have dwindled in 
unbelief because of the traditions 
of their fathers, ye can see of your-
selves that they never would again 
have dwindled in unbelief.

16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will  
not  utterly  destroy  them,  but  I  
will  cause  that  in  the  day  of  my 
wis dom  they  shall  a return  again 
unto me, saith the Lord.

17 And  now  behold,  saith  the 
Lord, concerning the people of the 
Nephites:  If  they  will  not  repent, 
and observe to do my will, I will ut-
terly a destroy them, saith the Lord, 
because of their unbelief notwith-
standing  the  many  mighty  works 
which  I  have  done  among  them; 
and  as  surely  as  the  Lord  liveth 
shall these things be, saith the Lord.

CHAPTER 16

The Nephites who believe Samuel are 
baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be 
slain with the arrows and stones of the 
unrepentant  Nephites—Some  harden 
their hearts, and others see angels—The 
unbelievers say it is not reasonable to 
believe  in  Christ  and  His  coming  in 
Jerusalem. About 6–1 b.c.
