these  things;  for  I  truly  had  seen 
b angels,  and  they  had  ministered 
unto me. And also, I had c heard the 
voice of the Lord speaking unto me 
in  very  word,  from  time  to  time; 
wherefore, I could not be shaken.

6 And it came to pass that he came 
unto me, and on this wise did he 
speak unto me, saying: Brother Ja-
cob, I have sought much opportu-

for I have heard and also know that 
thou goest about much, preaching 
that  which  ye  call  the  a gospel,  or

9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou 
the Christ who shall come? And he 
said: If there should be a Christ, I 
would  not  deny  him;  but  I  know 
that there is no Christ, neither has 
been, nor ever will be.

10 And I said unto him: Believest 
thou the scriptures? And he said, 
Yea.

11 And I said unto him: Then ye do 
not understand them; for they truly 
testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto
