35 And it would be better for them 
if they had not been born. For do ye  
suppose that ye can get rid of the  
justice of an a offended God, who hath  
been b trampled under feet of men, 
that thereby salvation might come?
36 And  now  behold,  as  I  spake 
concerning  those  whom  the  Lord 
hath chosen, yea, even three who 
were  caught  up  into  the  heavens, 
that I knew not whether they were 
a cleansed  from  b mortality  to  im-
mortality—

37 But behold, since I wrote, I have 
inquired of the Lord, and he hath 
made it manifest unto me that there 
must  needs  be  a  change  wrought 
upon their bodies, or else it needs 
be that they must taste of death;

38 Therefore, that they might not 
taste of death there was a a change 
wrought  upon  their  bodies,  that 
they  might  not  b suffer  pain  nor 
sorrow save it were for the sins of 
the world.

39 Now this change was not equal 
to that which shall take place at the 
last  day;  but  there  was  a  change 
wrought  upon  them,  insomuch 
that  Satan  could  have  no  power 
over them, that he could not a tempt 
them; and they were b sanctified in 
the flesh, that they were c holy, and

that the powers of the earth could 
not hold them.

40 And in this state they were to 
remain until the judgment day of 
Christ; and at that day they were 
to receive a greater change, and to 
be  received  into  the  kingdom  of 
the Father to go no more out, but 
to dwell with God eternally in the 
heavens.

CHAPTER 29

The coming forth of the Book of Mor-
mon is a sign that the Lord has com-
menced  to  gather  Israel  and  fulfill 
His covenants—Those who reject His 
latter-day revelations and gifts will be 
cursed. About a.d. 34–35.
