Moreover,  the  word  of  the  Lord 
said unto me: Take thee a great a roll, 
and write in it with a man’s pen, 
concerning b Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
2 And  I  took  unto  me  faithful 
a witnesses  to  record,  Uriah  the 
priest,  and  Zechariah  the  son  of 
Jeberechiah.

3 And I went unto the prophetess; 
and she conceived and bare a son. 
Then said the Lord to me: a Call his 
name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4 For behold, a the child shall b not 
have knowledge to cry, My father, 
and my mother, before the riches 
of Damascus and the c spoil of d Sa-
maria shall be taken away before 
the king of e Assyria.

5 The  Lord  spake  also  unto  me

again, saying:

6 Forasmuch as this people refus-
eth the waters of a Shiloah that go 
softly,  and  rejoice  in  b Rezin  and 
Remaliah’s son;

7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord 
bringeth up upon them the waters 
of the river, strong and many, even 
the king of a Assyria and all his glory; 
and he shall come up over all his 
channels, and go over all his banks.
8 And  he  shall  pass  through  Ju-
dah; he shall overflow and go over, 
he  shall  a reach  even  to  the  neck; 
and the stretching out of his wings 
shall fill the breadth of thy land, 
O Immanuel.

10 Take  counsel  together,  and  it 
shall  come  to  naught;  speak  the 
word,  and  it  shall  not  stand;  for 
God is with us.

11 For the Lord spake thus to me 
with a strong hand, and instructed 
me  that  I  should  not  walk  in  the 
way of this people, saying:

12 Say  ye  not,  A  confederacy,  to 
all to whom this people shall say, A 
a confederacy; neither fear ye their 
fear, nor be afraid.

13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts him-
self, and let him be your fear, and 
let him be your dread.

14 And he shall be for a sanctuary;  
but for a a stone of b stumbling, and 
for a  c rock of  d offense to both the 
houses of Israel, for a gin and a e snare  
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15 And  many  among  them  shall 
a stumble and fall, and be broken, 
and be snared, and be taken.

16 a Bind up the testimony, seal the

law among my disciples.
