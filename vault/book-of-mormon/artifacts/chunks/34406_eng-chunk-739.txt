And thus we can behold how false, 
and  also  the  unsteadiness  of  the 
hearts of the children of men; yea, 
we  can  see  that  the  Lord  in  his 
great infinite goodness doth bless 
and  a prosper those who put their 
b trust in him.

2 Yea, and we may see at the very 
a time  when  he  doth  b prosper  his 
people, yea, in the increase of their 
fields, their flocks and their herds, 
and in gold, and in silver, and in all 
manner of c precious things of every 
kind  and  art;  sparing  their  lives,  
and  delivering  them  out  of  the 
hands of their enemies; softening 
the hearts of their enemies that they 
should  not  declare  wars  against 
them;  yea,  and  in  fine,  doing  all 
things for the welfare and happiness 
of his people; yea, then is the time 
that they do  d harden their hearts, 
and do e forget the Lord their God, 
and do f  trample under their feet the

Holy One—yea, and this because of 
their  ease,  and  their  exceedingly 
great prosperity.

3 And thus we see that except the 
Lord doth a chasten his people with 
many afflictions, yea, except he doth 
visit them with b death and with ter-
ror, and with famine and with all 
manner of pestilence, they will not

and how evil, and devilish, and how 
b quick to do iniquity, and how slow 
to do good, are the children of men; 
yea, how quick to hearken unto the 
words  of  the  evil  one,  and  to  set 
their c hearts upon the vain things of  
the world!
