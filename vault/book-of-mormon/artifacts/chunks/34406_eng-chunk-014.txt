of  b goodly  c parents, therefore I  
was d taught somewhat in all the 
learning of my father; and having 
seen many e afflictions in the course 
of  my  days,  nevertheless,  having 
been highly favored of the Lord in all  
my  days;  yea,  having  had  a  great

d prophets,  prophesying  unto  the 
people  that  they  must  e repent,  or 
the  great  city  f Jerusalem  must  be  
destroyed.

5 Wherefore it came to pass that 
my  father,  Lehi,  as  he  went  forth 
prayed  unto  the  Lord,  yea,  even
