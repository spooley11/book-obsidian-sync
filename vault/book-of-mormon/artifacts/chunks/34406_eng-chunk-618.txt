36 Now these  a dissenters, having 
the same instruction and the same 
information  of  the  Nephites,  yea, 
having been instructed in the same 
b knowledge of the Lord, neverthe-
less, it is strange to relate, not long 
after their dissensions they became 
more hardened and c impenitent, and 
more  wild,  wicked  and  ferocious 
than  the  Lamanites—drinking  in  
with the d traditions of the Laman-
ites; giving way to e indolence, and 
all manner of lasciviousness; yea, en-
tirely forgetting the Lord their God.

CHAPTER 48
Amalickiah  incites  the  Lamanites 
against the Nephites—Moroni prepares 
his  people  to  defend  the  cause  of  the 
Christians—He rejoices in liberty and 
freedom and is a mighty man of God. 
About 72 b.c.

And  now  it  came  to  pass  that,  as 
soon as a Amalickiah had obtained  
the kingdom he began to b inspire the  
hearts  of  the  Lamanites  against 
the  people  of  Nephi;  yea,  he  did 
appoint men to speak unto the La-
manites from their c towers, against 
the Nephites.

2 And  thus  he  did  inspire  their 
hearts  against  the  Nephites,  inso-
much that in the latter end of the 
a nineteenth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the judges, he having accomplished 
his designs thus far, yea, having been 
made king over the Lamanites, he 
b sought also to  c reign over all the  
land, yea, and all the people who 
were in the land, the Nephites as 
well as the Lamanites.

3 Therefore he had accomplished 
his design, for he had hardened the 
hearts of the Lamanites and blinded 
their minds, and stirred them up to 
anger, insomuch that he had gath-
ered together a numerous host to 
go to battle against the Nephites.

4 For he was determined, because 
of the greatness of the number of his 
people, to a overpower the Nephites 
and to bring them into bondage.

5 And thus he did appoint a chief 
captains of the b Zoramites, they be-
ing the most acquainted with the 
strength of the Nephites, and their 
places  of  resort,  and  the  weakest 
parts  of  their  cities;  therefore  he 
appointed them to be chief captains 
over his armies.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
took their camp, and moved forth 
toward  the  land  of  Zarahemla  in 
the wilderness.
