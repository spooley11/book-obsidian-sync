9 And they said unto him: Behold, 
he is feeding thy a horses. Now the 
king had commanded his servants, 
previous to the time of the water-
ing of their flocks, that they should 
prepare  his  horses  and  chari ots, 
and conduct him forth to the land 
of  Nephi;  for  there  had  been  a 
b great c feast appointed at the land 
of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, 
who was king over all the land.

10 Now when king Lamoni heard 
that  Ammon  was  preparing  his 
horses and his a chariots he was more 
astonished, because of the faithful-
ness of Ammon, saying: Surely there 
has not been any servant among all 
my servants that has been so faith-
ful  as  this  man;  for  even  he  doth 
remember all my commandments 
to execute them.

11 Now I surely know that this is 
the Great Spirit, and I would desire

him that he come in unto me, but 
I durst not.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon had made ready the horses 
and the chariots for the king and 
his  servants,  he  went  in  unto  the 
king,  and  he  saw  that  the  a coun-
tenance of the king was changed; 
therefore  he  was  about  to  return 
out of his presence.

13 And one of the king’s servants 
said unto him,  a Rabbanah, which 
is, being interpreted, powerful or 
great king, considering their kings 
to  be  powerful;  and  thus  he  said 
unto him: Rabbanah, the king de-
sireth thee to stay.

14 Therefore Ammon turned him-
self  unto  the  king,  and  said  unto 
him: What wilt thou that I should 
do for thee, O king? And the king 
answered him not for the space of 
an  a hour, according to their time, 
for  he  knew  not  what  he  should 
say unto him.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  said  unto  him  again:  What 
desirest thou of me? But the king 
answered him not.
