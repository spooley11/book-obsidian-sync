1 NEPHI 12  : 12–23

righteousness; and their garments 
were white even like unto the Lamb 
of God. And the angel said unto me: 
These are made white in the blood 
of the Lamb, because of their faith 
in him.

12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of 
the a fourth generation who passed 
away in righteousness.

13 And it came to pass that I saw 
the  multitudes  of  the  earth  gath-
ered together.

14 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold thy seed, and also the seed 
of thy brethren.

15 And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld the people of my seed 
gathered  together  in  multitudes 
a against the seed of my brethren; 
and  they  were  gathered  together 
to battle.

16 And the angel spake unto me, 
saying:  Behold  the  fountain  of 
a filthy water which thy father saw; 
yea,  even  the  b river  of  which  he 
spake; and the depths thereof are 
the depths of c hell.

17 And the a mists of darkness are 
the temptations of the devil, which 
b blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth 
the hearts of the children of men, 
and leadeth them away into c broad 
roads, that they perish and are lost.
18 And  the  large  and  spacious 
a building, which thy father saw, is 
vain b imaginations and the c pride 
of the children of men. And a great 
and a terrible d gulf divideth them; 
yea, even the word of the e justice of 
the Eternal God, and the Messiah 
who is the Lamb of God, of whom 
the  Holy  Ghost  beareth  record, 
from  the  beginning  of  the  world

until this time, and from this time 
henceforth and forever.
