17 And  at  some  period  of  time 
they will be a brought to believe in 
his word, and to know of the incor-
rectness of the traditions of their 
fathers; and many of them will be 
saved, for the Lord will be merci-
ful unto all who b call on his name.
18 But behold, I say unto you that 
if ye persist in your wickedness that 
your days shall not be a prolonged 
in the land, for the b Lamanites shall 
be sent upon you; and if ye repent 
not they shall come in a time when 
you know not, and ye shall be vis-
ited  with  c utter  destruction;  and 
it shall be according to the fierce 
d anger of the Lord.

19 For he will not suffer you that 
ye  shall  live  in  your  iniquities, 
to  a destroy  his  people.  I  say  unto 
you,  Nay;  he  would  rather  suffer 
that the Lamanites might destroy 
all  his  people  who  are  called  the 
people of Nephi, if it were possible 
that they could b fall into sins and 
transgressions,  after  having  had 
so much light and so much knowl-
edge given unto them of the Lord  
their God;

20 Yea, after having been such a 
highly favored people of the Lord; 
yea,  after  having  been  favored 
above every other a nation, kindred,

tongue, or people; after having had 
all things b made known unto them, 
according to their desires, and their 
faith, and prayers, of that which has 
been,  and  which  is,  and  which  is  
to come;

21 Having  been  a visited  by  the 
Spirit  of  God;  having  conversed 
with angels, and having been spo-
ken unto by the voice of the Lord; 
and having the spirit of prophecy, 
and the spirit of revelation, and also 
many gifts, the gift of speaking with 
tongues, and the gift of preaching, 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
the gift of b translation;
