27 And it must needs be that the 
a power of God must be with him, 
even  unto  his  commanding  you 
that  ye  must  obey.  But  behold,  it 
was not he, but it was the b Spirit of 
the Lord which was in him, which 
c opened his mouth to utterance that 
he could not shut it.

28 And now my son, Laman, and 
also Lemuel and Sam, and also my 
sons who are the sons of Ishmael, 
behold, if ye will hearken unto the 
voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. 
And  if  ye  will  hearken  unto  him 
I  leave  unto  you  a  a blessing,  yea, 
even my first blessing.

29 But if ye will not hearken unto 
him I take away my a first blessing, 
yea, even my blessing, and it shall 
rest upon him.

30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto 
you: Behold, thou art the a servant 
of  Laban;  nevertheless,  thou  hast

been brought out of the land of Je-
rusalem, and I know that thou art 
a true b friend unto my son, Nephi, 
forever.

31 Wherefore, because thou hast 
been  faithful  thy  seed  shall  be 
blessed  a with  his  seed,  that  they 
dwell in prosperity long upon the 
face of this land; and nothing, save it 
shall be iniquity among them, shall 
harm  or  disturb  their  prosperity 
upon the face of this land forever.
32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the 
commandments  of  the  Lord,  the 
Lord  hath  consecrated  this  land 
for  the  security  of  thy  seed  with 
the seed of my son.

CHAPTER 2
Redemption  comes  through  the  Holy 
Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is 
essential to existence and progression—
Adam fell that men might be—Men are 
free to choose liberty and eternal life. 
About 588–570 b.c.
And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: 
Thou art my a firstborn in the days 
of my tribulation in the wilderness. 
And behold, in thy childhood thou 
hast suffered afflictions and much 
sorrow, because of the rudeness of 
thy brethren.

2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn 
in  the  wilderness,  thou  knowest 
the greatness of God; and he shall 
consecrate  thine  a afflictions  for  
thy gain.
