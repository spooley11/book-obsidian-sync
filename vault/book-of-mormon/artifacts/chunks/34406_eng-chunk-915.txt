The brother of Jared sees the finger of 
the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—
Christ  shows  His  spirit  body  to  the 
brother  of  Jared—Those  who  have  a 
perfect knowledge cannot be kept from 
within  the  veil—Interpreters  are  pro-
vided to bring the Jaredite record to light.

And it came to pass that the brother 
of Jared, (now the number of the 
vessels  which  had  been  prepared 
was  eight)  went  forth  unto  the 
a mount, which they called the mount  
b Shelem, because of its exceeding 
height, and did c molten out of a rock 
sixteen small stones; and they were 
white and clear, even as transpar-
ent  d glass; and he did carry them 
in  his  hands  upon  the  top  of  the 
mount,  and  cried  again  unto  the 
Lord, saying:

2 O Lord, thou hast said that we 
must be encompassed about by the 
floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do 
not be a angry with thy servant be-
cause of his weakness before thee; 
for we know that thou art holy and 
dwellest  in  the  heavens,  and  that 
we are b unworthy before thee; be-
cause of the c fall our d natures have 
become evil continually; neverthe-
less, O Lord, thou hast given us a 
commandment  that  we  must  call 
upon thee, that from thee we may 
receive according to our desires.

3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten 
us because of our iniquity, and hast 
driven us forth, and for these many 
years we have been in the wilder-
ness; nevertheless, thou hast been 
a merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon 
me in pity, and turn away thine an-
ger from this thy people, and suffer 
not that they shall go forth across

this  raging  deep  in  darkness;  but 
behold these b things which I have 
molten out of the rock.
