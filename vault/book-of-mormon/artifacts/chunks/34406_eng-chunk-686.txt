47 Yea, and regulations were made 
concerning  the  law.  And  their 
a judges, and their chief judges were 
chosen.

48 And  the  people  of  Nephi  be-
gan to a prosper again in the land, 
and began to multiply and to wax 
exceedingly  strong  again  in  the 
land. And they began to grow ex-
ceedingly rich.

49 But  notwithstanding  their 
riches,  or  their  strength,  or  their 
prosperity, they were not lifted up 
in the pride of their eyes; neither 
were  they  a slow  to  remember  the 
Lord their God; but they did humble 
themselves exceedingly before him.
50 Yea,  they  did  remember  how 
great things the Lord had done for 
them, that he had a delivered them 
from death, and from bonds, and 
from prisons, and from all manner 
of  b afflictions,  and  he  had  c deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their 
enemies.

51 And  they  did  pray  unto  the 
Lord  their  God  continually,  inso-
much that the Lord did bless them, 
according to his word, so that they 
did wax strong and a prosper in the 
land.

52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  all 
these things were done. And  a He-
laman died, in the thirty and fifth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.
