CHAPTER 5
Mormon again leads the Nephite armies 
in  battles  of  blood  and  carnage—The 
Book of Mormon will come forth to con- 
vince all Israel that Jesus is the Christ 
—Because of their unbelief, the Laman-
ites will be scattered, and the Spirit will 
cease to strive with them—They will re-
ceive the gospel from the Gentiles in the 
latter days. About a.d. 375–84.
And it came to pass that I did go 
forth among the Nephites, and did 
repent  of  the  a oath  which  I  had  
made that I would no more assist 
them; and they gave me command 
again  of  their  armies,  for  they 
looked upon me as though I could 
deliver them from their afflictions.
2 But behold, I was a without hope, 
for I knew the judgments of the Lord 
which should come upon them; for 
they repented not of their iniqui-
ties, but did struggle for their lives 
without  calling  upon  that  Being 
who created them.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come against us as 
we had fled to the city of Jordan; 
but behold, they were driven back 
that  they  did  not  take  the  city  at 
that time.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  against  us  again,  and  we 
did  maintain  the  city.  And  there 
were also other cities which were 
maintained by the Nephites, which 
strongholds did cut them off that 
they could not get into the country 
which lay before us, to destroy the 
inhabitants of our land.

5 But it came to pass that whatso-
ever lands we had passed by, and 
the  inhabitants  thereof  were  not 
gathered in, were destroyed by the 
Lamanites, and their towns, and vil-
lages, and cities were burned with 
fire;  and  thus  three  hundred  and 
seventy and nine years passed away.
6 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and eightieth year 
the  Lamanites  did  come  again 
against us to battle, and we did stand  
against them boldly; but it was all in 
vain, for so a great were their num-
bers that they did tread the people 
of the Nephites under their feet.

7 And it came to pass that we did  
again take to flight, and those whose 
flight was swifter than the Laman-
ites’  did  escape,  and  those  whose 
flight did not exceed the Lamanites’ 
were swept down and destroyed.
