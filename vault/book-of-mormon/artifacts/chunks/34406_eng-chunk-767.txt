3 NEPHI 3  : 2–12

the leader and the governor of this 
band of robbers; and these were the 
words which were written, saying:
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief 
governor of the land, behold, I write 
this epistle unto you, and do give 
unto you exceedingly great praise 
because of your firmness, and also 
the  firmness  of  your  people,  in 
a maintaining that which ye suppose 
to be your right and b liberty; yea, 
ye do stand well, as if ye were sup-
ported by the hand of a god, in the 
defence of your liberty, and your 
property, and your country, or that  
which ye do call so.

3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, 
most  noble  Lachoneus,  that  ye 
should be so foolish and vain as to 
suppose that ye can stand against 
so many brave men who are at my 
command, who do now at this time 
stand in their arms, and do await 
with great anxiety for the word—
Go  down  upon  the  Nephites  and 
a destroy them.

4 And I, knowing of their uncon-
querable spirit, having proved them 
in the field of battle, and knowing of 
their everlasting hatred towards you 
because of the many wrongs which 
ye have done unto them, therefore 
if they should come down against 
you they would visit you with utter 
destruction.

5 Therefore  I  have  written  this  
epistle,  sealing  it  with  mine  own 
hand, feeling for your welfare, be-
cause of your firmness in that which 
ye believe to be right, and your noble  
spirit in the field of battle.

6 Therefore I write unto you, desir-
ing that ye would yield up unto this 
my people, your cities, your lands, 
and your possessions, rather than 
that they should visit you with the 
sword and that destruction should 
come upon you.

7 Or  in  other  words,  yield  your-
