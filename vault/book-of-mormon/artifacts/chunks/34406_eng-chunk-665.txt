3 Yea,  and  it  became  expedient 
that we should employ our men to 
the maintaining those parts of the 
land which we had regained of our 
possessions; therefore it became ex-
pedient that we should wait, that we 
might receive more strength from 
the land of Zarahemla and also a 
new supply of provisions.

4 And it came to pass that I thus 
did send an embassy to the governor 
of our land, to acquaint him con-
cerning the affairs of our people. 
And it came to pass that we did wait 
to receive provisions and strength 
from the land of Zarahemla.

5 But behold, this did profit us but 
little; for the Lamanites were also 
receiving great strength from day 
to day, and also many provisions; 
and  thus  were  our  circumstances 
at this period of time.

6 And the Lamanites were sallying 
forth against us from time to time, 
resolving by stratagem to destroy us; 
nevertheless we could not come to 
battle with them, because of their 
a retreats and their strongholds.

7 And it came to pass that we did 
wait in these difficult circumstances 
for the space of many months, even 
until we were about to a perish for 
the want of food.

8 But it came to pass that we did 
receive food, which was guarded to 
us by an army of two thousand men 
to our assistance; and this is all the 
assistance which we did receive, to 
defend ourselves and our country

from falling into the hands of our 
enemies,  yea,  to  contend  with  an 
enemy which was innumerable.

9 And now the cause of these our 
embarrassments, or the cause why 
they did not send more strength unto 
us, we knew not; therefore we were 
grieved and also filled with fear, lest  
by any means the judgments of God 
should come upon our land, to our 
overthrow and utter destruction.

10 Therefore we did pour out our 
souls in prayer to God, that he would 
strengthen us and deliver us out of 
the hands of our enemies, yea, and 
also give us strength that we might 
retain our cities, and our lands, and 
our possessions, for the support of 
our people.
