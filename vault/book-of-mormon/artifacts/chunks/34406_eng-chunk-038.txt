my family also, I beheld a a river of 
water; and it ran along, and it was 
near the tree of which I was par-

14 And  I  looked  to  behold  from 
whence it came; and I saw the head 
thereof a little way off; and at the 
head thereof I beheld your mother

desirous  that  Laman  and  Lemuel 
should  come  and  partake  of  the 
fruit  also;  wherefore,  I  cast  mine 
eyes towards the head of the river,

them,  but  they  would  a not  come 
unto me and partake of the fruit.
