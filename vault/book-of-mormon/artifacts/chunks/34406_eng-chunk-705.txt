2 For as their laws and their gov-
ernments were established by the 
a voice of the people, and they who 
b chose  evil  were  c more  numerous 
than they who chose good, therefore 
they were d ripening for destruction, 
for the laws had become corrupted.
3 Yea,  and  this  was  not  all;  they 
were  a  a stiffnecked  people,  inso-
much that they could not be gov-
erned by the law nor justice, save 
it were to their destruction.

4 And it came to pass that Nephi 
had become weary because of their 
iniquity;  and  he  yielded  up  the 
judgment-seat,  and  took  it  upon 
him to preach the word of God all 
the remainder of his days, and his 
brother Lehi also, all the remain-
der of his days;

5 For they remembered the words 
which their a father Helaman spake 
unto them. And these are the words 
which he spake:

6 Behold,  my  sons,  I  desire  that 
ye  should  remember  to  keep  the 
commandments  of  God;  and  I 
would that ye should declare unto 
the people these words. Behold, I 
have given unto you the names of 
our  first  a parents  who  came  out  
of the land of Jerusalem; and this 
I have done that when you remem-
ber your names ye may remember 
them; and when ye remember them 
ye may remember their works; and 
when ye remember their works ye 
may know how that it is said, and 
also written, that they were b good.
7 Therefore, my sons, I would that 
ye  should  do  that  which  is  good, 
that it may be said of you, and also 
written, even as it has been said and 
written of them.

8 And now my sons, behold I have 
somewhat  more  to  desire  of  you, 
which  desire  is,  that  ye  may  not 
do these things that ye may boast, 
but that ye may do these things to 
lay up for yourselves a a treasure in 
heaven, yea, which is eternal, and 
which  fadeth  not  away;  yea,  that 
ye may have that b precious gift of 
eternal life, which we have reason 
to suppose hath been given to our 
fathers.
