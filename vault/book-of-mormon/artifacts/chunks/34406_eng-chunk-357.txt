7 Therefore they sent their armies 
forth;  yea,  even  the  king  himself 
went  before  his  people;  and  they 
went  up  to  the  land  of  Nephi  to 
destroy the people of Limhi.

8 And  now  Limhi  had  discov-
ered  them  from  the  a tower,  even 
all their preparations for war did 
he discover; therefore he gathered 
his people together, and laid wait 
for  them  in  the  fields  and  in  the  
forests.

9 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites had come up, that the 
people of Limhi began to fall upon 
them from their waiting places, and 
began to slay them.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
battle became exceedingly sore, for 
they fought like lions for their prey.
11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of Limhi began to drive the 
Lamanites  before  them;  yet  they 
were not half so numerous as the 
Lamanites.  But  they  a fought  for 
their  lives,  and  for  their  b wives, 
and  for  their  children;  therefore 
they  exerted  themselves  and  like 
dragons did they fight.

12 And it came to pass that they 
found  the  king  of  the  Lamanites

among  the  number  of  their  dead; 
yet  he  was  not  dead,  having  been 
wounded and left upon the ground, 
so speedy was the flight of his people.
13 And they took him and bound 
up his wounds, and brought him be-
fore Limhi, and said: Behold, here 
is  the  king  of  the  Lamanites;  he 
having received a wound has fallen 
among their dead, and they have left 
him; and behold, we have brought 
him  before  you;  and  now  let  us  
slay him.
