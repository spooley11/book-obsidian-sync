6 And it came to pass that we did 
pitch  our  tents  by  the  seashore; 
and  notwithstanding  we  had  suf-
fered many a afflictions and much 
difficulty, yea, even so much that 
we cannot write them all, we were 
exceedingly rejoiced when we came 
to the seashore; and we called the 
place Bountiful, because of its much  
fruit.

7 And it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had been in the land of Boun-
tiful  for  the  space  of  many  days,  
the  voice  of  the  Lord  came  unto 
me, saying: a Arise, and get thee into 
the mountain. And it came to pass 
that I arose and went up into the 
mountain, and cried unto the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that the Lord 
spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt 
a construct  a  ship,  after  the  b man-
ner which I shall show thee, that I 
may carry thy people across these  
waters.

9 And I said: Lord, whither shall 
I go that I may find ore to molten, 
that I may make a tools to construct 
the  ship  after  the  manner  which 
thou hast shown unto me?

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord told me whither I should go 
to find ore, that I might make tools.
11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,  
did make a bellows wherewith to 
a blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; 
and after I had made a bellows, that 
I might have wherewith to blow the

fire, I did smite two stones together 
that I might make fire.

12 For the Lord had not hitherto 
suffered that we should make much 
fire, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness;  for  he  said:  I  will  make  thy 
food become sweet, that ye  a cook  
it not;

13 And I will also be your a light in 
the wilderness; and I will prepare 
the way before you, if it so be that 
ye shall keep my commandments; 
wherefore,  inasmuch  as  ye  shall 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be led towards the b promised land; 
and ye shall c know that it is by me 
that ye are led.
