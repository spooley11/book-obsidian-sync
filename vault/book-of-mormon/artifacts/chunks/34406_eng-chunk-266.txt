BEHOLD,  it  came  to  pass  that

I,  a Enos,  knowing  my  father  
   that  b he was a just man—for 
he c taught me in his language, and  
also  in  the  d nurture  and  admoni-
tion  of  the  Lord—and  blessed  be 
the name of my God for it—

2 And I will tell you of the a wres-
tle which I had before God, before 
I received a b remission of my sins.
3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in 
the forests; and the words which I 
had  often  heard  my  father  speak 
concerning eternal life, and the a joy 
of  the  saints,  b sunk  deep  into  my  
heart.

4 And  my  soul  a hungered;  and  I 
b kneeled  down  before  my  Maker, 
and  I  c cried  unto  him  in  mighty 
d prayer and supplication for mine 
own soul; and all the day long did 
I cry unto him; yea, and when the 
night came I did still raise my voice 
high that it reached the heavens.

5 And there came a a voice unto me, 
saying: Enos, thy sins are b forgiven 
thee, and thou shalt be blessed.

6 And  I,  Enos,  knew  that  God 
a could not lie; wherefore, my guilt 
was swept away.

7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?
8 And he said unto me: a Because 
of thy b faith in Christ, whom thou 
hast never before heard nor seen. 
And many years pass away before 
he  shall  manifest  himself  in  the 
flesh;  wherefore,  go  to,  thy  faith 
hath made thee c whole.

9 Now, it came to pass that when 
I had heard these words I began to 
feel a a desire for the b welfare of my 
brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, 
I did c pour out my whole soul unto 
God for them.
