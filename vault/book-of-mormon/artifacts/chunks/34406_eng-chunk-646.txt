and they were exceedingly valiant 
for a courage, and also for strength 
and activity; but behold, this was 
not all—they were men who were 
true at all times in whatsoever thing 
they were entrusted.

21 Yea, they were men of truth and 
a soberness, for they had been taught 
to keep the commandments of God 
and to b walk uprightly before him.
22 And now it came to pass that 
Helaman did march at the head of 
his a two thousand stripling soldiers, 
to the support of the people in the 
borders of the land on the south by 
the west sea.

23 And  thus  ended  the  twenty 
and eighth year of the reign of the 
judges over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 54

Ammoron and Moroni negotiate for the 
exchange of prisoners—Moroni demands 
that the Lamanites withdraw and cease 
their  murderous  attacks—Ammoron 
demands  that  the  Nephites  lay  down 
their arms and become subject to the 
Lamanites. About 63 b.c.

And now it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the twenty and ninth 
year of the judges, that a Ammoron 
sent unto Moroni desiring that he 
would exchange prisoners.

2 And it came to pass that Moroni 
felt to a rejoice exceedingly at this 
request,  for  he  desired  the  provi-
sions which were imparted for the 
support of the Lamanite prisoners 
for  the  support  of  his  own  peo-
ple;  and  he  also  desired  his  own 
people  for  the  strengthening  of  
his army.

3 Now  the  Lamanites  had  taken 
many  women  and  children,  and 
there was not a woman nor a child 
among all the prisoners of Moroni, 
or the prisoners whom Moroni had 
taken;  therefore  Moroni  resolved

upon a stratagem to obtain as many 
prisoners of the Nephites from the 
Lamanites as it were possible.

4 Therefore  he  wrote  an  epistle, 
and sent it by the servant of Am-
moron, the same who had brought 
an  epistle  to  Moroni.  Now  these 
are the words which he wrote unto 
Ammoron, saying:

5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written 
unto you somewhat concerning this 
war which ye have waged against 
my  people,  or  rather  which  thy 
a brother hath waged against them, 
and which ye are still determined 
to carry on after his death.
