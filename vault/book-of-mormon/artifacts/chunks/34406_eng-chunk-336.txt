25 And it came to pass that after 
Abinadi had made an end of these 
sayings that he said unto them: Have 
ye  a taught  this  people  that  they 
should observe to do all these things 
for to keep these commandments?
26 I  say  unto  you,  Nay;  for  if  ye 
had, the Lord would not have caused 
me to come forth and to prophesy 
evil concerning this people.

27 And now ye have said that sal-
vation cometh by the law of Moses. 
I say unto you that it is expedient 
that  ye  should  a keep  the  law  of 
Moses  as  yet;  but  I  say  unto  you,

that  the  time  shall  come  when  it 
shall b no more be expedient to keep 
the law of Moses.

28 And moreover, I say unto you, 
that  a salvation  doth  not  come  by 
the b law alone; and were it not for 
the c atonement, which God himself 
shall make for the sins and iniqui-
ties of his people, that they must 
unavoidably perish, notwithstand-
ing the law of Moses.

29 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
it was expedient that there should 
be  a  law  given  to  the  children  of 
Israel, yea, even a very a strict law; 
for they were a stiffnecked people, 
b quick to do iniquity, and slow to 
remember the Lord their God;
