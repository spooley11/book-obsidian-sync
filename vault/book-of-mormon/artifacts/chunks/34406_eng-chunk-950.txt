21 And after the brother of Jared 
had beheld the finger of the Lord, 
because of the a promise which the 
brother of Jared had obtained by 
faith, the Lord could not withhold 
anything from his sight; wherefore 
he showed him all things, for he could  
no longer be kept without the b veil.
22 And it is by faith that my fathers  
have  obtained  the  a promise  that 
these  things  should  come  unto 
their brethren through the Gentiles; 
therefore the Lord hath commanded 
me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

23 And I said unto him: Lord, the 
Gentiles will a mock at these things, 
because of our b weakness in writing; 
for Lord thou hast made us c mighty 
in word by faith, but thou hast not 
made us mighty in writing; for thou 
hast made all this people that they 
could speak much, because of the 
Holy Ghost which thou hast given 
them;

24 And thou hast made us that we 
could  write  but  little,  because  of 
the a awkwardness of our hands. Be-
hold, thou hast not made us mighty 
in  b writing  like  unto  the  brother 
of Jared, for thou madest him that 
the  things  which  he  c wrote  were 
mighty even as thou art, unto the 
overpowering of man to read them.
25 Thou hast also made our words 
powerful  and  great,  even  that  we 
a cannot write them; wherefore, when  
we write we behold our b weakness, 
and  stumble  because  of  the  plac-
ing of our words; and I fear lest the 
Gentiles shall c mock at our words.
26 And when I had said this, the 
Lord spake unto me, saying: a Fools 
b mock, but they shall mourn; and 
my grace is sufficient for the meek, 
that they shall take no advantage 
of your weakness;

27 And  if  men  come  unto  me  I 
will show unto them their  a weak-
ness.  I  b give  unto  men  weakness 
that they may be humble; and my 
c grace is sufficient for all men that 
d humble themselves before me; for 
if they humble themselves before 
me, and have faith in me, then will 
I make e weak things become strong 
unto them.
