11 Now the people of Akish were 
desirous for gain, even as Akish was 
desirous for a power; wherefore, the 
sons of Akish did offer them b money,  
by which means they drew away the 
more part of the people after them.
12 And  there  began  to  be  a  war 
between  the  sons  of  Akish  and  
Akish, which lasted for the space 
of  many  years,  yea,  unto  the  de-
struction of nearly all the people 
of the kingdom, yea, even all, save 
it were thirty souls, and they who 
fled with the house of Omer.

13 Wherefore, Omer was restored 
again to the a land of his inheritance.
14 And it came to pass that Omer 
began  to  be  old;  nevertheless,  in 
his old age he begat Emer; and he 
anointed Emer to be king to reign 
in his stead.

15 And after that he had anointed 
Emer  to  be  king  he  saw  peace  in 
the land for the space of two years, 
and  he  died,  having  seen  exceed-
ingly many days, which were full 
of sorrow. And it came to pass that 
Emer did reign in his stead, and did 
fill the steps of his father.

16 And  the  Lord  began  again  to 
take the curse from off the land, and 
the house of Emer did prosper ex-
ceedingly under the reign of Emer; 
and in the space of sixty and two 
years they had become exceedingly 
strong, insomuch that they became 
exceedingly rich—

17 Having  a all  manner  of  fruit, 
and of grain, and of b silks, and of 
fine linen, and of c gold, and of sil-
ver, and of precious things;

18 And also a all manner of cattle, 
of  oxen,  and  cows,  and  of  sheep, 
and of swine, and of goats, and also 
many other kinds of animals which 
were useful for the food of man.

19 And they also had a horses, and 
asses,  and  there  were  elephants 
and cureloms and cumoms; all of 
which were useful unto man, and 
more especially the elephants and 
cureloms and cumoms.
