10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies  of  Coriantumr  did  press 
upon the armies of Shiz that they 
beat them, that they caused them 
to flee before them; and they did 
flee southward, and did pitch their 
tents in a place which was called  
Ogath.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
army of Coriantumr did pitch their 
tents by the hill Ramah; and it was 
that  same  hill  where  my  father 
Mormon did  a hide up the records 
unto the Lord, which were sacred.

ETHER 15  : 12–28

12 And it came to pass that they 
did gather together all the people 
upon all the face of the land, who 
had not been slain, save it was Ether.
13 And it came to pass that Ether 
did  a behold  all  the  doings  of  the 
people; and he beheld that the peo-
ple who were for Coriantumr were 
gathered  together  to  the  army  of 
Cori antumr;  and  the  people  who 
were  for  Shiz  were  gathered  to-
gether to the army of Shiz.

14 Wherefore,  they  were  for  the 
space  of  four  years  gathering  to-
gether the people, that they might 
get all who were upon the face of 
the land, and that they might re-
ceive all the strength which it was 
possible that they could receive.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they were all gathered together, ev-
ery one to the army which he would,  
with their wives and their children— 
both men, women and children be-
ing  armed  with  a weapons  of  war, 
having  shields,  and  b breastplates, 
and head-plates, and being clothed 
after the manner of war—they did 
march forth one against another to 
battle; and they fought all that day, 
and conquered not.
