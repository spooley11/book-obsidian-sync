24 And now, except ye do repent 
of  that  which  ye  have  done,  and 
begin to be up and doing, and send 
forth food and men unto us, and also 
unto Helaman, that he may support 
those  parts  of  our  country  which 
he has regained, and that we may 
also recover the remainder of our 
possessions in these parts, behold it 
will be expedient that we contend 
no more with the Lamanites until 
we have first cleansed our inward 
vessel, yea, even the great head of 
our government.

25 And except ye grant mine epis-
tle,  and  come  out  and  show  unto 
me a true  a spirit of freedom, and

strive to strengthen and fortify our 
armies, and grant unto them food 
for their support, behold I will leave 
a part of my freemen to maintain 
this  part  of  our  land,  and  I  will 
leave the strength and the blessings 
of God upon them, that none other 
power can operate against them—
26 And  this  because  of  their  ex-
ceeding  faith,  and  their  patience 
in their a tribulations—

27 And I will come unto you, and 
if  there  be  any  among  you  that 
has  a  desire  for  freedom,  yea,  if 
there be even a spark of freedom 
remaining, behold I will stir up in-
surrections among you, even until 
those  who  have  desires  to  usurp 
power and authority shall become  
extinct.

28 Yea, behold I do not fear your 
power  nor  your  authority,  but  it 
is my  a God whom I fear; and it is 
according  to  his  commandments 
that I do take my sword to defend 
the cause of my country, and it is 
because  of  your  iniquity  that  we 
have suffered so much loss.

29 Behold it is time, yea, the time 
is now at hand, that except ye do 
bestir yourselves in the defence of 
your country and your little ones, 
the a sword of justice doth hang over 
you; yea, and it shall fall upon you 
and  visit  you  even  to  your  utter 
destruction.

30 Behold,  I  wait  for  assistance 
from  you;  and,  except  ye  do  ad-
minister unto our relief, behold, I 
come unto you, even in the land of 
Zarahemla, and smite you with the 
sword, insomuch that ye can have no 
more power to impede the progress 
of this people in the cause of our  
freedom.
