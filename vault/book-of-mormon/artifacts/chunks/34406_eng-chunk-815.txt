5 Behold,  a I  am  he  that  gave  the 
law,  and  I  am  he  who  covenanted 
with  my  people  Israel;  therefore, 
the law in me is fulfilled, for I have 
come to b fulfil the law; therefore it 
hath an end.

6 Behold,  I  do  a not  destroy  the 
prophets, for as many as have not 
been fulfilled in me, verily I say unto  
you, shall all be fulfilled.

7 And because I said unto you that 
old things have passed away, I do not 
destroy that which hath been spoken  
concerning things which are to come.
8 For behold, the a covenant which 
I have made with my people is not 
all fulfilled; but the law which was 
given unto Moses hath an end in me.
9 Behold, I am the  a law, and the 
b light. Look unto me, and endure to 
the end, and ye shall c live; for unto 
him that d endureth to the end will 
I give eternal life.

10 Behold, I have given unto you 
the a commandments; therefore keep 
my commandments. And this is the 
law and the prophets, for they truly 
b testified of me.

11 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words, 
he  a said  unto  those  twelve  whom 
he had chosen:

12 Ye are my a disciples; and ye are 
a b light unto this people, who are a  
remnant of the house of c Joseph.

13 And behold, this is the a land of 
your  inheritance;  and  the  Father 
hath given it unto you.

14 And not at any time hath the 
Father given me commandment that 
I should a tell it unto your brethren 
at Jerusalem.

15 Neither  at  any  time  hath  the 
Father given me commandment that 
I should tell unto them concerning 
the  a other  tribes  of  the  house  of 
Israel,  whom  the  Father  hath  led 
away out of the land.

16 This much did the Father a com-
mand  me,  that  I  should  tell  unto 
them:

17 That other sheep I have which 
are  not  of  this  fold;  them  also  I 
must bring, and they shall hear my 
voice; and there shall be one fold, 
and one a shepherd.
