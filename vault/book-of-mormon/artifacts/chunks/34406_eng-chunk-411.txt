7 Now this was the cause of much 
affliction to Alma, yea, and to many  
of the people whom Alma had con-
secrated to be a teachers, and b priests, 
and  c elders  over  the  church;  yea, 
many of them were sorely grieved 
for the wickedness which they saw 
had begun to be among their people.
8 For  they  saw  and  beheld  with 
great sorrow that the people of the 
church began to be lifted up in the 
pride of their eyes, and to set their 
a hearts upon riches and upon the 
vain things of the world, that they 
began to be scornful, one towards 
another, and they began to persecute 
those that did b not believe accord-
ing to their own will and pleasure.
9 And thus, in this eighth year of 
the reign of the judges, there began 
to be great a contentions among the 
people of the church; yea, there were 
b envyings, and c strife, and malice, 
and persecutions, and pride, even 
to  exceed  the  pride  of  those  who 
did not belong to the church of God.
10 And  thus  ended  the  eighth

year of the reign of the judges; and 
the wickedness of the church was 
a  great  a stumbling-block  to  those 
who did not belong to the church; 
and thus the church began to fail 
in its progress.

11 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the ninth year, Alma 
saw the wickedness of the church, 
and he saw also that the a example 
of the church began to lead those 
who were unbelievers on from one 
piece  of  iniquity  to  another,  thus 
bringing on the destruction of the 
people.

12 Yea,  he  saw  great  inequality 
among  the  people,  some  lifting 
themselves up with their pride, de-
spising others, turning their backs 
upon the a needy and the naked and 
those who were b hungry, and those 
who  were  athirst,  and  those  who 
were sick and afflicted.
