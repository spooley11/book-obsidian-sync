we trust God will a deliver us, not-
withstanding the weakness of our 
armies, yea, and deliver us out of 
the hands of our enemies.

38 Behold, this is the twenty and 
ninth year, in the latter end, and we 
are in the possession of our lands; 
and the Lamanites have fled to the 
land of Nephi.

39 And  those  sons  of  the  people  
of  Ammon,  of  whom  I  have  so 
highly spoken, are with me in the 
city of Manti; and the Lord has sup-
ported  them,  yea,  and  kept  them 
from  falling  by  the  sword,  inso-
much that even  a one soul has not  
been slain.

40 But behold, they have received 
many  wounds;  nevertheless  they 
a stand fast in that b liberty where-
with God has made them free; and 
they are strict to remember the Lord 
their God from day to day; yea, they 
do observe to keep his statutes, and 
his judgments, and his command-
ments continually; and their faith 
is strong in the prophecies concern-
ing that which is to come.

41 And now, my beloved brother, 
Moroni, may the Lord our God, who 
has redeemed us and made us free, 
keep  you  continually  in  his  pres-
ence;  yea,  and  may  he  favor  this 
people, even that ye may have suc-
cess in obtaining the possession of 
all that which the Lamanites have 
taken from us, which was for our 
support. And now, behold, I close 
mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son  
of Alma.

CHAPTER 59

Moroni asks Pahoran to strengthen the 
forces  of  Helaman—The  Lamanites 
take  the  city  of  Nephihah—Moroni 
is  angry  with  the  government.  About  
62 b.c.
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, after Moroni 
had  received  and  had  read  Hela-
man’s a epistle, he was exceedingly 
rejoiced because of the welfare, yea,

the exceeding success which Hela-
man had had, in obtaining  b those 
lands which were lost.
