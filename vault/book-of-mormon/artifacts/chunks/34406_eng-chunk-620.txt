13 Yea,  and  he  was  a  man  who 
was firm in the faith of Christ, and 
he had a sworn with an oath to de-
fend his people, his rights, and his 
country, and his religion, even to 
the loss of his blood.

14 Now the Nephites were taught

to defend themselves against their 
enemies,  even  to  the  shedding  of 
blood if it were necessary; yea, and 
they were also taught a never to give 
an offense, yea, and never to raise 
the sword except it were against an 
enemy, except it were to preserve 
their lives.

15 And this was their a faith, that by 
so doing God would b prosper them 
in the land, or in other words, if they 
were faithful in keeping the com-
mandments of God that he would 
prosper them in the land; yea, warn 
them to flee, or to prepare for war, 
according to their danger;

16 And also, that God would make 
it known unto them a whither they 
should  go  to  defend  themselves 
against  their  enemies,  and  by  so 
doing, the Lord would deliver them; 
and  this  was  the  faith  of  Moroni, 
and his heart did glory in it;  b not 
in the shedding of blood but in do-
ing good, in preserving his people, 
yea, in keeping the commandments 
of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.
17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, 
if all men had been, and were, and 
ever would be, like unto  a Moroni, 
behold,  the  very  powers  of  hell 
would  have  been  shaken  forever; 
yea,  the  b devil  would  never  have 
power over the hearts of the children  
of men.

18 Behold, he was a man like unto 
a Ammon,  the  son  of  Mosiah,  yea, 
and even the other sons of Mosiah, 
yea, and also Alma and his sons, for 
they were all men of God.

19 Now behold, Helaman and his 
brethren were no less a serviceable 
unto the people than was Moroni; 
for  they  did  preach  the  word  of 
God,  and  they  did  baptize  unto
