them, but it is a commandment of 
the Lord.

6 Therefore go, my son, and thou 
shalt be favored of the Lord, because 
thou hast a not b murmured.

7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
said unto my father: I a will go and 
do the things which the Lord hath 
commanded,  for  I  know  that  the 
Lord  giveth  no  b commandments 
unto the children of men, save he 
shall c prepare a way for them that 
they  may  accomplish  the  thing 
which he commandeth them.

8 And it came to pass that when 
my father had heard these words he 
was exceedingly glad, for he knew 
that I had been blessed of the Lord.
9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren 
took our journey in the wilderness, 
with our tents, to go up to the land 
of Jerusalem.

10 And it came to pass that when 
we had gone up to the land of Je-
rusalem,  I  and  my  brethren  did 
consult one with another.

11 And  we  a cast  lots—who  of  us 
should go in unto the house of Laban.  
And it came to pass that the lot fell 
upon Laman; and Laman went in 
unto  the  house  of  Laban,  and  he 
talked  with  him  as  he  sat  in  his 
house.

12 And  he  desired  of  Laban  the 
records which were engraven upon 
the plates of brass, which contained 
the a genealogy of my father.

13 And  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
that Laban was angry, and thrust 
him out from his presence; and he 
would not that he should have the 
records.  Wherefore,  he  said  unto 
him: Behold thou art a robber, and 
I will slay thee.

14 But Laman fled out of his pres-
ence, and told the things which La-
ban had done, unto us. And we began  
to  be  exceedingly  sorrowful,  and 
my brethren were about to return  
unto my father in the wilderness.
