10 And I would, my brethren, that 
ye should know that all the kindreds 
of the earth cannot be blessed un-
less he shall make a bare his arm in 
the eyes of the nations.

11 Wherefore, the Lord God will 
proceed to make bare his arm in the 
eyes of all the a nations, in bringing 
about his covenants and his gospel 
unto  those  who  are  of  the  house 
of Israel.

12 Wherefore, he will a bring them 
again  out  of  b captivity,  and  they 
shall be  c gathered together to the 
lands  of  their  d inheritance;  and  
they  shall  be  e brought  out  of  ob-
scurity  and  out  of  f darkness;  and 
they  shall  know  that  the  g Lord  is

their  h Savior and their Redeemer, 
the i  Mighty One of Israel.

13 And the blood of that great and 
a abominable church, which is the  
whore  of  all  the  earth,  shall  turn 
upon their own heads; for they shall 
b war  among  themselves,  and  the 
sword of their c own hands shall fall 
upon their own heads, and they shall 
be drunken with their own blood.
14 And every a nation which shall 
war against thee, O house of Israel,  
shall  be  turned  one  against  an-
other, and they shall b fall into the 
pit  which  they  digged  to  ensnare 
the people of the Lord. And all that  
c fight  against  Zion  shall  be  de-
stroyed, and that great whore, who 
hath  perverted  the  right  ways  of 
the Lord, yea, that great and abomi-
nable church, shall tumble to the 
d dust and great shall be the fall of it.
15 For behold, saith the prophet, 
the time cometh speedily that Sa-
tan shall have no more power over 
the hearts of the children of men; 
for the day soon cometh that all the 
proud and they who do wickedly 
shall  be  as  a stubble;  and  the  day 
cometh that they must be b burned.
16 For the time soon cometh that 
the fulness of the a wrath of God shall  
be poured out upon all the children
