13 Yea, and that same God did es-
tablish his church among them; yea, 
and that same God hath called me 
by  a  a holy  calling,  to  b preach  the 
word  unto  this  people,  and  hath 
given me much success, in the which 
my joy is full.

14 But  I  do  not  joy  in  my  own 
a success alone, but my joy is more 
full  because  of  the  success  of  my 
brethren, who have been up to the 
land of Nephi.

15 Behold, they have labored ex-
ceedingly, and have brought forth 
much fruit; and how great shall be 
their reward!

16 Now, when I think of the suc-
cess of these my brethren my soul 
is carried away, even to the separa-
tion of it from the body, as it were, 
so great is my a joy.

17 And now may God grant unto 
these, my brethren, that they may 
sit down in the kingdom of God; yea,  
and also all those who are the fruit 
of their labors that they may go no 
more out, but that they may praise 
him  forever.  And  may  God  grant 
that  it  may  be  done  according  to 
my words, even as I have spoken. 
Amen.

CHAPTER 30

Korihor, the anti-Christ, ridicules Christ,  
the Atonement, and the spirit of proph-
ecy—He teaches that there is no God, no 
fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no 
Christ—Alma testifies that Christ will 
come and that all things denote there is 
a God—Korihor demands a sign and is 
struck dumb—The devil had appeared 
to Korihor as an angel and taught him 
what to say—Korihor is trodden down 
and dies. About 76–74 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that 
after the  a people of Ammon were 
established in the land of Jershon, 
yea,  and  also  after  the  Lamanites 
were  b driven out of the land, and 
their dead were buried by the peo-
ple of the land—
