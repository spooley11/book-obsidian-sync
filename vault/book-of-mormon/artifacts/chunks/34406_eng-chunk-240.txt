35 Behold, ye have done a greater 
iniquities than the Lamanites, our 
brethren. Ye have broken the hearts 
of your tender wives, and lost the 
confidence  of  your  children,  be-
cause of your bad examples before 
them;  and  the  sobbings  of  their 
hearts  ascend  up  to  God  against 
you. And because of the b strictness 
of the word of God, which cometh 
down against you, many hearts died, 
pierced with deep wounds.

CHAPTER 3

The pure in heart receive the pleasing 
word of God—Lamanite righteousness 
exceeds  that  of  the  Nephites—Jacob 
warns against fornication, lascivious-
ness, and every sin. About 544–421 b.c.

But behold, I, Jacob, would speak 
unto  you  that  are  pure  in  heart. 
Look  unto  God  with  firmness  of 
mind, and a pray unto him with ex-
ceeding faith, and he will b console 
you in your c afflictions, and he will 
plead your cause, and send down 
d justice upon those who seek your 
destruction.

2 O all ye that are pure in heart, 
lift up your heads and receive the 
pleasing  word  of  God,  and  feast

upon his a love; for ye may, if your 
b minds are c firm, forever.

3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are 
not  pure  in  heart,  that  are  filthy 
this day before God; for except ye 
repent the land is a cursed for your 
sakes;  and  the  Lamanites,  which 
are not b filthy like unto you, nev-
ertheless  they  are  c cursed  with  a 
sore cursing, shall scourge you even 
unto destruction.

4 And the time speedily cometh, 
that except ye repent they shall pos-
sess the land of your inheritance, 
and the Lord God will a lead away 
the righteous out from among you.
5 Behold,  the  Lamanites  your 
brethren,  whom  ye  hate  because 
of their filthiness and the cursing 
which hath come upon their skins,  
are more righteous than you; for they 
have not a forgotten the command-
ment of the Lord, which was given 
unto our father—that they should 
have  save  it  were  b one  wife,  and  
c concubines they should have none, 
and there should not be d whoredoms 
committed among them.

6 And  now,  this  commandment 
they  observe  to  keep;  wherefore, 
because of this observance, in keep-
ing  this  commandment,  the  Lord 
God will not destroy them, but will 
be  a merciful  unto  them;  and  one 
day  they  shall  b become  a  blessed  
people.
