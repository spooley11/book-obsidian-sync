many miracles among the children 
of men, how is it that he cannot a in-
struct me, that I should build a ship?
52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, said many things unto my 
brethren, insomuch that they were 
a confounded and could not contend 
against me; neither durst they lay 
their  hands  upon  me  nor  touch 
me  with  their  fingers,  even  for 
the space of many days. Now they 
durst not do this lest they should 
wither before me, so powerful was 
the b Spirit of God; and thus it had 
wrought upon them.

53 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  said  unto  me:  Stretch  forth 
thine hand again unto thy breth-
ren, and they shall not wither be-
fore  thee,  but  I  will  a shock  them, 
saith the Lord, and this will I do, 
that they may know that I am the 
Lord their God.

54 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I 
stretched forth my hand unto my 
brethren, and they did not wither 
before me; but the Lord did shake 
them, even according to the word 
which he had spoken.

55 And now, they said: We know 
of  a  surety  that  the  Lord  is  a with 
thee,  for  we  know  that  it  is  the 
power of the Lord that has shaken 
us. And they fell down before me, 
and were about to b worship me, but 
I would not suffer them, saying: I am 
thy brother, yea, even thy younger 
brother;  wherefore,  worship  the 
Lord thy God, and honor thy father 
and thy mother, that thy c days may 
be long in the land which the Lord 
thy God shall give thee.

CHAPTER 18
The ship is finished—The births of Jacob  
and  Joseph  are  mentioned —The

company  embarks  for  the  promised 
land—The sons of Ishmael and their 
wives  join  in  revelry  and  rebellion—
Nephi is bound, and the ship is driven 
back  by  a  terrible  tempest—Nephi 
is  freed,  and  by  his  prayer  the  storm 
ceases—The people arrive in the prom-
ised land. About 591–589 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
a worship the Lord, and did go forth 
with me; and we did work timbers 
of curious b workmanship. And the 
Lord did show me from time to time 
after what manner I should work 
the timbers of the c ship.
