20 It  shall  never  be  a inhabited, 
neither  shall  it  be  dwelt  in  from 
generation  to  generation:  neither 
shall the Arabian pitch tent there; 
neither shall the shepherds make 
their fold there.

21 But  a wild beasts of the desert 
shall  lie  there;  and  their  houses 
shall  be  full  of  doleful  creatures; 
and owls shall dwell there, and sa-
tyrs shall dance there.

22 And the wild beasts of the islands  
shall cry in their desolate houses, and 
dragons  in  their  pleasant  palaces; 
and her time is near to come, and 
her day shall not be prolonged. For I  
will  destroy  her  speedily;  yea,  for 
I will be merciful unto my people, 
but the wicked shall perish.

CHAPTER 24

Israel will be gathered and will enjoy 
millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out 
of heaven for rebellion—Israel will tri-
umph over Babylon (the world)—Com-
pare Isaiah 14. About 559–545 b.c.
a For the Lord will have mercy on 
Jacob, and will yet  b choose Israel, 
and set them in their own land; and 
the c strangers shall be joined with 
them, and they shall cleave to the 
house of Jacob.

2 And the people shall take them 
and bring them to their place; yea, 
from far unto the ends of the earth; 
and they shall return to their a lands 
of promise. And the house of Israel 
shall  b possess  them,  and  the  land 
of  the  Lord  shall  be  for  c servants 
and handmaids; and they shall take 
them captives unto whom they were 
captives; and they shall d rule over 
their oppressors.

3 And it shall come to pass in that 
day  that  the  Lord  shall  give  thee 
a rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy 
fear,  and  from  the  hard  bondage 
wherein thou wast made to serve.
4 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that  day,  that  thou  shalt  take  up 
this  proverb  a against  the  king  of 
b Babylon,  and  say:  How  hath  the 
oppressor  ceased,  the  golden  city  
ceased!

5 The Lord hath broken the staff 
of the a wicked, the scepters of the 
rulers.

6 a He  who  smote  the  people  in 
wrath with a continual stroke, he 
that ruled the nations in anger, is 
persecuted, and none hindereth.
