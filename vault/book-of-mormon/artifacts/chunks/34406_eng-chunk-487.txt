ALMA 19  : 7–18

his soul, yea, he knew that this had 
d overcome his natural frame, and 
he was carried away in God—

7 Therefore,  what  the  queen  de-
sired  of  him  was  his  only  desire. 
Therefore,  he  went  in  to  see  the 
king  according  as  the  queen  had 
desired him; and he saw the king, 
and he knew that he was not dead.
8 And  he  said  unto  the  queen: 
He is not dead, but he sleepeth in 
God, and on the morrow he shall 
rise again; therefore bury him not.

forth  his  hand  unto  the  woman, 
and  said:  Blessed  be  the  name  of 
God, and blessed art thou.

13 For as sure as thou livest, be-
hold,  I  have  a seen  my  Redeemer; 
and  he  shall  come  forth,  and  be 
b born of a c woman, and he shall re-

his name. Now, when he had said 
these words, his heart was swollen 
within him, and he sunk again with
