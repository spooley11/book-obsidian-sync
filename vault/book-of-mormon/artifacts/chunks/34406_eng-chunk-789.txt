12 But behold, there was a more 
great  and  terrible  destruction  in 
the  land  northward;  for  behold, 
the  a whole  face  of  the  land  was 
changed,  because  of  the  tempest 
and the whirlwinds, and the thun-

in broken fragments, and in seams 
and in cracks, upon all the face of 
the land.

19 And it came to pass that when 
the thunderings, and the lightnings, 
and  the  storm,  and  the  tempest,
