diSCiPLeS Of JeSUS ChriST

An account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.

The  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites  are 
all converted unto the Lord—They have 
all things in common, work miracles, 
and prosper in the land—After two cen-
turies, divisions, evils, false churches, 
and  persecutions  arise—After  three 
hundred years, both the Nephites and 
the  Lamanites  are  wicked—Amma-
ron hides up the sacred records. About  
a.d. 35–321.

AND  it  came  to  pass  that  the

thirty and fourth year passed  
   away, and also the thirty and 
fifth,  and  behold  the  disciples  of 
Jesus had formed a church of Christ 
in all the lands round about. And as 
many as did come unto them, and 
did truly repent of their sins, were 
a baptized in the name of Jesus; and 
they did also receive the Holy Ghost.
2 And it came to pass in the thirty 
and sixth year, the people were all  
converted unto the Lord, upon all 
the face of the land, both Nephites 
and Lamanites, and there were no 
contentions and disputations among 
them, and every man did deal justly 
one with another.

3 And  they  had  a all  things  com-
mon among them; therefore there 
were not rich and poor, bond and 
free, but they were all made free, 
and partakers of the heavenly b gift.
4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
thirty and seventh year passed away 
also, and there still continued to be 
a peace in the land.
