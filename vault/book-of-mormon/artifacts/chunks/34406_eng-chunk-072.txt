35 And there is a place prepared, 
yea, even that a awful b hell of which 
I have spoken, and the c devil is the 
preparator of it; wherefore the fi-
nal state of the souls of men is to 
dwell in the kingdom of God, or to 
be cast out because of that d justice 
of which I have spoken.

36 Wherefore, the wicked are re-
jected from the righteous, and also 
from that a tree of life, whose fruit is 
most precious and most b desirable 
above all other fruits; yea, and it is 
the c greatest of all the d gifts of God. 
And thus I spake unto my brethren.  
Amen.

CHAPTER 16

The wicked take the truth to be hard—
Lehi’s  sons  marry  the  daughters  of

Ishmael—The  Liahona  guides  their 
course  in  the  wilderness—Messages 
from the Lord are written on the Lia-
hona from time to time—Ishmael dies; 
his family murmurs because of afflic-
tions. About 600–592 b.c.

And now it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had made an end of speaking 
to  my  brethren,  behold  they  said 
unto me: Thou hast declared unto 
us hard things, more than we are 
able to bear.

2 And it came to pass that I said 
unto them that I knew that I had 
spoken  a hard  things  against  the 
wicked,  according  to  the  truth; 
and the righteous have I justified, 
and  testified  that  they  should  be 
lifted  up  at  the  last  day;  where-
fore,  the  b guilty  taketh  the  c truth 
to be hard, for it d cutteth them to 
the very center.

3 And  now  my  brethren,  if  ye 
were righteous and were willing to  
hearken to the truth, and give heed 
unto  it,  that  ye  might  a walk  up-
rightly before God, then ye would 
not murmur because of the truth, 
and say: Thou speakest hard things  
against us.

4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  exhort  my  brethren,  with  all 
dil i gence,  to  keep  the  command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did a humble themselves before the 
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and 
great hopes of them, that they would 
walk in the paths of righteousness.
6 Now, all these things were said

33 a  Ezek. 18:26;

Mosiah 15:26;  
Moro. 10:26.
