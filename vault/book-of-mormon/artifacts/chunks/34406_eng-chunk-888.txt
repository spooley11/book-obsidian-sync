14 And behold, they shall go unto 
the a unbelieving of the b Jews; and 
for this intent shall they go—that 
they may be c persuaded that Jesus

is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God;  that  the  Father  may  bring 
about,  through  his  most  Beloved, 
his  great  and  eternal  purpose,  in 
restoring the Jews, or all the house 
of Israel, to the d land of their inheri-
tance,  which  the  Lord  their  God 
hath given them, unto the fulfilling 
of his e covenant;

15 And also that the seed of a this 
people may more fully believe his 
gospel, which shall b go forth unto 
them  from  the  Gentiles;  for  this 
people shall be c scattered, and shall 
d become a dark, a filthy, and a loath-
some people, beyond the descrip-
tion of that which ever hath been 
amongst  us,  yea,  even  that  which 
hath been among the Lamanites, and 
this because of their unbelief and  
idolatry.

16 For  behold,  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord hath already ceased to a strive 
with  their  fathers;  and  they  are 
without Christ and God in the world; 
and they are driven about as b chaff 
before the wind.

17 They were once a delightsome 
people, and they had Christ for their 
a shepherd; yea, they were led even 
by God the Father.

18 But now, behold, they are a led 
about  by  Satan,  even  as  chaff  is 
driven before the wind, or as a ves-
sel is tossed about upon the waves, 
without sail or anchor, or without 
anything  wherewith  to  steer  her; 
and even as she is, so are they.

19 And behold, the Lord hath re-
served their blessings, which they
