15 And they came down again that 
they might pitch battle against the 
Nephites. And they were led by a 
man whose name was a Coriantumr; 
and he was a descendant of Zara-
hemla; and he was a b dissenter from 
among the Nephites; and he was a 
large and a mighty man.

16 Therefore, the king of the La-
manites,  whose  name  was  Tubal-
oth, who was the son of a Ammoron, 
supposing that Coriantumr, being 
a mighty man, could stand against 
the Nephites, with his strength and 
also with his great b wisdom, inso-
much  that  by  sending  him  forth 
he  should  gain  power  over  the  
Nephites—

17 Therefore he did a stir them up 
to anger, and he did gather together 
his armies, and he did appoint Co-
riantumr  to  be  their  leader,  and 
did cause that they should march 
down to the land of Zarahemla to 
battle against the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that because 
of so much contention and so much 
difficulty in the government, that 
they had not kept sufficient guards 
in the land of Zarahemla; for they 
had  supposed  that  the  Lamanites 
durst  not  come  into  the  heart  of 
their lands to attack that great city 
Zarahemla.

19 But it came to pass that Corian-
tumr did march forth at the head 
of  his  numerous  host,  and  came 
upon  the  inhabitants  of  the  city, 
and  their  march  was  with  such 
exceedingly great speed that there

was  no  time  for  the  Nephites  to 
gather together their armies.

20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut 
down the watch by the entrance 
of  the  city,  and  did  march  forth 
with his whole army into the city, 
and they did slay every one who 
did  oppose  them,  insomuch  that 
they  did  take  possession  of  the 
whole city.
