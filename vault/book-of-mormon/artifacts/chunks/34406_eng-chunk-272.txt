6 And  they  were  scattered  upon 
a much of the face of the land, and 
the Lamanites also. And they were 
exceedingly more b numerous than 
were they of the Nephites; and they 
loved c murder and would drink the 
d blood of beasts.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  many  times  against  us,  the 
Nephites, to battle. But our a kings 
and our b leaders were mighty men 
in the faith of the Lord; and they 
taught the people the ways of the 
Lord; wherefore, we withstood the 
Lamanites and swept them away out

of c our lands, and began to fortify 
our  cities,  or  whatsoever  place  of 
our inheritance.

8 And we multiplied exceedingly, 
and  spread  upon  the  face  of  the 
land, and became exceedingly rich 
in a gold, and in silver, and in pre-
cious things, and in fine b workman-
ship of wood, in buildings, and in 
c machinery,  and  also  in  iron  and 
copper, and brass and steel, making 
all manner of tools of every kind 
to till the ground, and d weapons of 
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, 
and the quiver, and the dart, and 
the  javelin,  and  all  preparations  
for war.

9 And thus being prepared to meet 
the Lamanites, they did not prosper 
against us. But the word of the Lord 
was verified, which he spake unto 
our fathers, saying that: a Inasmuch 
as ye will keep my commandments 
ye shall b prosper in the land.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
prophets of the Lord did threaten 
the people of Nephi, according to 
the  word  of  God,  that  if  they  did 
not keep the commandments, but 
should fall into transgression, they 
should be a destroyed from off the 
face of the land.

11 Wherefore,  the  prophets,  and 
the priests, and the  a teachers, did 
labor diligently, exhorting with all 
long-suffering the people to  b dili-
gence; teaching the c law of Moses, 
and  the  intent  for  which  it  was 
given;  persuading  them  to  d look 
forward unto the Messiah, and be-
lieve in him to come e as though he
