45 Now,  behold,  I  have  spoken 
unto you concerning the a death of 
the mortal body, and also concern-
ing the b resurrection of the mortal 
body. I say unto you that this mor-
tal body is c raised to an d immortal 
body, that is from death, even from 
the first death unto life, that they 
can e die no more; their spirits unit-
ing with their bodies, never to be 
divided; thus the whole becoming 
f spiritual and immortal, that they 
can no more see corruption.

46 Now, when Amulek had finished 
these words the people began again 
to be astonished, and also Zeezrom 
began to tremble. And thus ended 
the words of Amulek, or this is all 
that I have written.

CHAPTER 12
Alma speaks to Zeezrom—The mysteries 
of God can be given only to the faith-
ful—Men are judged by their thoughts, 
beliefs, words, and works—The wicked 
will suffer a spiritual death—This mor-
tal  life  is  a  probationary  state—The 
plan of redemption brings to pass the 
Resurrection and, through faith, a re-
mission of sins—The repentant have a 
claim on mercy through the Only Be-
gotten Son. About 82 b.c.
Now Alma, seeing that the words of 
Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for 
he beheld that Amulek had caught 
him in his a lying and deceiving to de-
stroy him, and seeing that he began 
to tremble under a b consciousness

of his guilt, he opened his mouth 
and began to speak unto him, and 
to establish the words of Amulek, 
and to explain things beyond, or to 
unfold the scriptures beyond that 
which Amulek had done.

2 Now the words that Alma spake 
unto  Zeezrom  were  heard  by  the 
people  round  about;  for  the  mul-
titude was great, and he spake on 
this wise:

3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou 
hast  been  taken  in  thy  lying  and 
craftiness,  for  thou  hast  not  lied 
unto men only but thou hast lied 
unto God; for behold, he knows all 
thy a thoughts, and thou seest that 
thy b thoughts are made known unto 
us by his Spirit;

4 And  thou  seest  that  we  know 
that  thy  plan  was  a  very  a subtle 
plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, 
for to lie and to deceive this peo-
ple  that  thou  mightest  set  them 
against us, to b revile us and to cast  
us out—
