9 And now, the Lamanites had a 
king, and his name was a Aaron; and 
he came against us with an army of 
forty and four thousand. And be-
hold, I withstood him with forty and 
two thousand. And it came to pass 
that I beat him with my army that 
he fled before me. And behold, all 
this was done, and three hundred 
and thirty years had passed away.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began to repent of their 
iniquity, and began to cry even as 
had been prophesied by Samuel the 
prophet; for behold no man could 
a keep that which was his own, for 
the  thieves,  and  the  robbers,  and 
the murderers, and the magic art, 
and  the  witchcraft  which  was  in 
the land.

11 Thus there began to be a a mourn-
ing  and  a  lamentation  in  all  the 
land  because  of  these  things,  and 
more especially among the people 
of Nephi.

12 And it came to pass that when I, 
Mormon, saw their lamentation and 
their  a mourning and their sorrow 
before the Lord, my heart did begin 
to rejoice within me, knowing the 
mercies and the long-suffering of

the Lord, therefore supposing that 
he  would  be  merciful  unto  them 
that  they  would  b again  become  a 
righteous people.

13 But behold this my joy was vain, 
for their  a sorrowing was not unto 
repentance, because of the goodness 
of God; but it was rather the b sor-
rowing of the c damned, because the 
Lord would not always suffer them 
to take d happiness in sin.

14 And  they  did  not  come  unto 
Jesus with broken a hearts and con-
trite spirits, but they did b curse God, 
and wish to die. Nevertheless they 
would struggle with the sword for 
their lives.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
sorrow did return unto me again, 
and  I  saw  that  the  a day  of  b grace 
c was passed with them, both tem-
porally  and  spiritually;  for  I  saw 
thousands of them hewn down in 
open d rebellion against their God, 
and heaped up as e dung upon the 
face  of  the  land.  And  thus  three 
hundred and forty and four years 
had passed away.
