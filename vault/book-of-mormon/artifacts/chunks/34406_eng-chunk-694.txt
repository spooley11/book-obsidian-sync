CHAPTER 2
Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes 
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band 
of  Kishkumen—Helaman’s  servant 
slays Kishkumen, and the Gadianton 
band flees into the wilderness. About 
50–49 b.c.
And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  forty 
and  second  year  of  the  reign  of 
the  judges,  after  Moronihah  had 
established  again  peace  between 
the  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites, 
behold there was no one to fill the 
judgment-seat; therefore there be-
gan to be a contention again among 
the people concerning who should 
fill the judgment-seat.

2 And it came to pass that a Hela-
man, who was the son of Helaman, 
was appointed to fill the judgment-
seat, by the b voice of the people.

3 But  behold,  a Kishkumen,  who 
had  murdered  Pahoran,  did  lay 
wait to destroy Helaman also; and 
he  was  upheld  by  his  band,  who 
had entered into a covenant that no 
one should know his wickedness.

4 For  there  was  one  a Gadianton, 
who was exceedingly expert in many 
words, and also in his craft, to carry 
on the secret work of murder and 
of robbery; therefore he became the  
leader of the band of Kishkumen.
5 Therefore he did a flatter them, 
and  also  Kishkumen,  that  if  they 
would place him in the judgment-
seat  he  would  grant  unto  those 
who belonged to his band that they 
should be placed in power and au-
thority  among  the  people;  there-

fore Kishkumen sought to destroy 
Helaman.

6 And it came to pass as he went 
forth  towards  the  judgment-seat 
to destroy Helaman, behold one of 
the  servants  of  Helaman,  having 
been out by night, and having ob-
tained, through disguise, a knowl-
edge  of  those  plans  which  had 
been laid by this band to destroy  
Helaman—

7 And it came to pass that he met 
Kishkumen, and he gave unto him 
a sign; therefore Kishkumen made 
known unto him the object of his 
desire, desiring that he would con-
duct him to the judgment-seat that 
he might murder Helaman.
