9 And the people who were in the 
land northward did dwell in a tents, 
and in houses of cement, and they 
did suffer whatsoever tree should 
spring  up  upon  the  face  of  the 
land  that  it  should  grow  up,  that 
in time they might have timber to 
build their houses, yea, their cities, 
and their temples, and their b syna-
gogues, and their sanctuaries, and 
all manner of their buildings.

10 And it came to pass as timber 
was exceedingly scarce in the land 
northward,  they  did  send  forth 
much by the way of a shipping.

HELAMAN 3  : 11–24

11 And thus they did enable the 
people in the land northward that 
they might build many cities, both 
of wood and of cement.

12 And it came to pass that there 
were many of the  a people of Am-
mon, who were Lamanites by birth, 
did also go forth into this land.

13 And  now  there  are  many 
a records kept of the proceedings of  
this people, by many of this people,  
which are particular and very large, 
concerning them.

14 But behold, a a hundredth part 
of the proceedings of this people, 
yea,  the  account  of  the  Laman-
ites and of the Nephites, and their  
wars, and contentions, and dissen-
sions,  and  their  preaching,  and 
their prophecies, and their shipping  
and  their  building  of  ships,  and 
their building of b temples, and of 
synagogues and their c sanctuaries, 
and their righteousness, and their 
wickedness, and their murders, and 
their robbings, and their plundering,  
and all manner of abominations and 
whoredoms,  cannot  be  contained 
in this work.

15 But  behold,  there  are  many 
books and many a records of every  
kind,  and  they  have  been  kept 
chiefly by the Nephites.
