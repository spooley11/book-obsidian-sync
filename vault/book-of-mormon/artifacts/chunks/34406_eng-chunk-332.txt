19 And  they  began  to  question 
him, that they might cross him, that 
thereby they might have wherewith 
to  a accuse  him;  but  he  answered 
them boldly, and withstood all their  
questions,  yea,  to  their  astonish-

ment; for he did  b withstand them 
in  all  their  questions,  and  did  
confound them in all their words.
20 And it came to pass that one of 
them said unto him: a What meaneth 
the words which are written, and 
which  have  been  taught  by  our 
fathers, saying:

21 a How beautiful upon the moun-
tains  are  the  feet  of  him  b that 
bringeth  good  tidings;  that  pub-
lisheth  peace;  that  bringeth  good 
tidings  of  good;  that  publisheth 
salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy 
God reigneth;

22 a Thy  watchmen  shall  lift  up 
the voice; with the voice together 
shall  they  sing;  for  they  shall  see 
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring 
again Zion;

23 Break  forth  into  joy;  sing  to-
gether ye waste places of Jerusalem; 
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;

24 The Lord hath made bare his 
holy a arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions, and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of our God?
25 And  now  Abinadi  said  unto 
them: Are you a priests, and pretend 
to teach this people, and to under-
stand the spirit of prophesying, and 
yet desire to know of me what these 
things mean?

26 I say unto you, wo be unto you 
for perverting the ways of the Lord! 
For if ye understand these things  
ye  have  not  taught  them;  there-
fore,  ye  have  perverted  the  ways 
of the Lord.

27 Ye have not applied your a hearts 
to  b understanding;  therefore,  ye 
have not been wise. Therefore, what 
teach ye this people?

28 And  they  said:  We  teach  the

law of Moses.

29 And again he said unto them:
