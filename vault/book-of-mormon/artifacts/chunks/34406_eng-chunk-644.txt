6 And it came to pass that Moroni 
had thus gained a victory over one 
of the greatest of the armies of the 
Lamanites, and had obtained pos-
session of the city of  a Mulek, which 
was  one  of  the  strongest  holds  of 
the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; 
and thus he had also built a strong-
hold to retain his prisoners.

7 And it came to pass that he did 
no more attempt a battle with the 
Lamanites in that year, but he did 
employ  his  men  in  preparing  for 
war, yea, and in making fortifica-
tions to guard against the Lamanites, 
yea, and also delivering their women 
and their children from famine and

affliction, and providing food for 
their armies.

8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
the armies of the Lamanites, on the 
west sea, south, while in the absence 
of Moroni on account of some in-
trigue amongst the Nephites, which 
caused a dissensions amongst them, 
had gained some ground over the 
Nephites, yea, insomuch that they 
had obtained possession of a num-
ber  of  their  cities  in  that  part  of  
the land.

9 And  thus  because  of  a iniquity 
amongst themselves, yea, because 
of dissensions and intrigue among 
themselves they were placed in the 
most dangerous circumstances.

10 And now behold, I have some-
what to say concerning the a people 
of Ammon, who, in the beginning, 
were  Lamanites;  but  by  Ammon 
and his brethren, or rather by the 
power and word of God, they had 
been b converted unto the Lord; and 
they had been brought down into 
the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and  had 
ever  since  been  protected  by  the 
Nephites.

11 And because of their oath they 
had been kept from taking up arms 
against their brethren; for they had 
taken an oath that they a never would 
shed  blood  more;  and  according 
to their oath they would have per-
ished; yea, they would have suffered 
themselves to have fallen into the 
hands of their brethren, had it not 
been for the pity and the exceeding 
love which Ammon and his breth-
ren had had for them.
