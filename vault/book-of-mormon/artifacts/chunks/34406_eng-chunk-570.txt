you concerning those a twenty-four 
plates, that ye keep them, that the 
b mysteries and the works of dark-
ness, and their secret works, or the 
secret works of those people who 
have been destroyed, may be made 
c manifest unto this people; yea, all 
their  murders,  and  robbings,  and 
their  plunderings,  and  all  their 
wickedness and abominations, may 
be made manifest unto this people; 
yea, and that ye preserve these d in-
terpreters.

22 For behold, the Lord saw that 
his people began to work in dark-
ness, yea, work secret murders and 
abominations;  therefore  the  Lord 
said,  if  they  did  not  repent  they 
should  be  destroyed  from  off  the 
face of the earth.

23 And the Lord said: I will prepare  
unto my servant Gazelem, a a stone, 
which shall shine forth in darkness 
unto light, that I may b discover unto 
my  people  who  serve  me,  that  I 
may discover unto them the works 
of their brethren, yea, their secret 
works, their works of darkness, and 
their wickedness and abominations.
24 And now, my son, these a inter-
preters were prepared that the word 
of God might be fulfilled, which he 
spake, saying:

25 I will a bring forth out of dark-
ness unto light all their secret works 
and their abominations; and except 
they repent I will b destroy them from 
off the face of the earth; and I will 
bring to light all their secrets and 
abominations,  unto  every  nation  
that shall hereafter possess the land.
26 And now, my son, we see that 
they did not repent; therefore they 
have been destroyed, and thus far 
the word of God has been fulfilled;

yea, their a secret abominations have 
been brought out of darkness and 
made known unto us.
