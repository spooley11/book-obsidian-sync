31 He hath given unto you that ye 
might a know good from evil, and he 
hath given unto you that ye might 
b choose  life  or  death;  and  ye  can 
do good and be c restored unto that 
which is good, or have that which is  
good restored unto you; or ye can 
do evil, and have that which is evil 
restored unto you.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord chastened the Nephites because 
He loved them—Converted Lamanites 
are firm and steadfast in the faith—The 
Lord will be merciful unto the Lamanites 
in the latter days. About 6 b.c.

And now, my beloved brethren, be-
hold, I declare unto you that except 
ye  shall  repent  your  houses  shall  
be left unto you a desolate.

2 Yea, except ye repent, your women  
shall have great cause to mourn in 
the day that they shall give suck; for 
ye shall attempt to flee and there 
shall be no place for  a refuge; yea, 
and wo unto them which are b with 
child, for they shall be heavy and 
cannot  flee;  therefore,  they  shall 
be trodden down and shall be left 
to perish.

3 Yea, wo unto this  a people who

are called the b people of Nephi ex-
cept they shall repent, when they 
shall see all these signs and wonders 
which shall be showed unto them;  
for behold, they have been a chosen  
people of the Lord; yea, the people 
of  Nephi  hath  he  loved,  and  also 
hath  he  c chastened  them;  yea,  in 
the days of their iniquities hath he 
chastened them because he loveth 
them.

4 But  behold  my  brethren,  the  
a Lamanites hath he hated because 
their deeds have been evil continu-
ally, and this because of the iniquity 
of  the  b tradition  of  their  fathers. 
But  behold,  salvation  hath  come 
unto them through the preaching 
of  the  Nephites;  and  for  this  in-
tent hath the Lord c prolonged their  
days.

5 And I would that ye should be-
hold  that  the  a more  part  of  them 
are in the path of their duty, and 
they do walk circumspectly before 
God, and they do observe to keep 
his commandments and his statutes 
and his judgments according to the 
law of Moses.
