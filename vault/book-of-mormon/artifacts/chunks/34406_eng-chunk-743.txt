this  people,  and  it  surely  cometh 
unto this people, and nothing can 
save this people save it be repentance  
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
who  surely  shall  come  into  the 
world, and shall suffer many things 
and shall be slain for his people.

7 And behold, an a angel of the Lord 
hath declared it unto me, and he 
did bring b glad tidings to my soul. 
And  behold,  I  was  sent  unto  you 
to declare it unto you also, that ye 
might have glad tidings; but behold 
ye would c not receive me.

8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: 
Because  of  the  hardness  of  the 
hearts of the people of the Neph-

away my word from them, and I will 
a withdraw my Spirit from them, and 
I will suffer them no longer, and I 
will turn the hearts of their brethren

9 And  a four hundred years shall 
not pass away before I will cause 
that  they  shall  be  smitten;  yea,  I 
will visit them with the sword and 
with famine and with pestilence.

10 Yea,  I  will  visit  them  in  my 
fierce  anger,  and  there  shall  be 
those  of  the  a fourth  generation 
who shall live, of your enemies, to 
behold your utter destruction; and 
this shall surely come except ye re-
pent, saith the Lord; and those of the 
fourth generation shall visit your  
destruction.

11 But if ye will repent and a return 
unto the Lord your God I will turn 
away  mine  anger,  saith  the  Lord; 
yea,  thus  saith  the  Lord,  blessed 
are they who will repent and turn 
unto me, but wo unto him that re-
penteth not.

12 Yea, a wo unto this great city of 
Zarahemla; for behold, it is because 
of those who are righteous that it
