25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi 
did fortify against them with their 
arms, and with all their might, trust-
ing in the God and  a rock of their 
salvation; wherefore, they became 
as yet, conquerors of their enemies.
26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I,  
Jacob,  began  to  be  old;  and  the 
record of this people being kept on 
the a other plates of Nephi, where-
fore, I conclude this record, declar-
ing that I have written according to 
the best of my knowledge, by say-
ing that the time passed away with 
us, and also our b lives passed away 
like as it were unto us a c dream, we 
being  a  d lonesome  and  a  solemn 
people,  e wanderers, cast out from 
Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a 
wilderness, and hated of our breth-
ren, which caused wars and conten-
tions; wherefore, we did mourn out  
our days.

27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must 
soon go down to my grave; where-
fore, I said unto my son a Enos: Take 
these  b plates.  And  I  told  him  the 
things  which  my  brother  Nephi 
had c commanded me, and he prom-
ised obedience unto the commands. 
And I make an end of my writing 
upon  these  plates,  which  writing 
has been d small; and to the reader 
I bid farewell, hoping that many of 
my brethren may read my words. 
Brethren, adieu.
