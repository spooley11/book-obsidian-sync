15 And the Lord shall utterly a de-
stroy  the  tongue  of  the  Egyptian 
sea;  and  with  his  mighty  wind 
he  shall  shake  his  hand  over  the  
river, and shall smite it in the seven 
streams, and make men go over b dry  
shod.

16 And there shall be a a highway 
for the remnant of his people which 
shall be left, from Assyria, like as 
it was to Israel in the day that he 
came up out of the land of Egypt.

CHAPTER 22
In the millennial day all men will praise 
the Lord—He will dwell among them—
Compare Isaiah 12. About 559–545 b.c.
a And  in  that  day  thou  shalt  say: 
O Lord, I will praise thee; though 
thou wast angry with me thine an-
ger is turned away, and thou com-
fortedst me.

2 Behold,  God  is  my  salvation;  I 
will  a trust,  and  not  be  afraid;  for 
the Lord b Jehovah is my c strength 
and my d song; he also has become 
my salvation.

3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw 
a water out of the wells of salvation.
4 And  in  that  day  shall  ye  say: 
a Praise the Lord, call upon his name, 
declare his doings among the peo-
ple, make mention that his name 
is exalted.

5 a Sing unto the Lord; for he hath 
done excellent things; this is known 
in all the earth.

6 a Cry out and shout, thou inhabi-
tant of Zion; for great is the Holy 
One of Israel in the midst of thee.
