12 And  he  will  take  upon  him 
a death, that he may b loose the bands 
of  death  which  bind  his  people; 
and  he  will  take  upon  him  their 
infirmities, that his bowels may be 
filled with mercy, according to the 
flesh, that he may know according 
to the flesh how to c succor his peo-
ple according to their infirmities.
13 Now  the  Spirit  a knoweth  all 
things; nevertheless the Son of God 
suffereth according to the b flesh that 
he might c take upon him the sins of 
his people, that he might blot out 
their  transgressions  according  to 
the power of his deliverance; and 
now behold, this is the testimony 
which is in me.

14 Now  I  say  unto  you  that  ye 
must  a repent,  and  be  born  again; 
for  the  Spirit  saith  if  ye  are  not 
born  again  ye  cannot  inherit  the 
kingdom of heaven; therefore come 
and be baptized unto repentance, 
that ye may be washed from your 
sins, that ye may have faith on the 
Lamb of God, who taketh away the 
sins  of  the  world,  who  is  mighty 
to save and to cleanse from all un-
righteousness.

15 Yea, I say unto you come and 
fear  not,  and  lay  aside  every  sin, 
which easily doth a beset you, which 
doth bind you down to destruction, 
yea, come and go forth, and show 
unto your God that ye are willing

to  repent  of  your  sins  and  enter 
into a covenant with him to keep 
his  commandments,  and  witness 
it unto him this day by going into 
the waters of baptism.

16 And  whosoever  doeth  this, 
and  keepeth  the  commandments 
of God from thenceforth, the same 
will a remember that I say unto him, 
yea, he will remember that I have 
said unto him, he shall have eter-
nal life, according to the testimony 
of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth  
in me.

17 And now my beloved brethren,  
do  you  believe  these  things?  Be-
hold,  I  say  unto  you,  yea,  I  know 
that ye believe them; and the way 
that I know that ye believe them is 
by the manifestation of the Spirit 
which is in me. And now because 
your faith is strong concerning that, 
yea, concerning the things which I 
have spoken, great is my joy.
