of them that afflict thee; who have 
said to thy soul: Bow down, that we 
may  go  over—and  thou  hast  laid 
thy body as the ground and as the 
street to them that went over.

24 a Awake,  awake,  put  on  thy 
b strength, O c Zion; put on thy beau-
tiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy 
city; for henceforth there shall d no 
more come into thee the uncircum-
cised and the unclean.

25 Shake  thyself  from  the  dust; 
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose 
thyself from the a bands of thy neck, 
O captive daughter of Zion.

CHAPTER 9

Jacob  explains  that  the  Jews  will  be 
gathered in all their lands of promise—
The Atonement ransoms man from the 
Fall—The bodies of the dead will come 
forth  from  the  grave,  and  their  spirits 
from hell and from paradise—They will 
be judged—The Atonement saves from 
death,  hell,  the  devil,  and  endless  tor-
ment—The righteous are to be saved in 
the kingdom of God—Penalties for sins 
are set forth—The Holy One of Israel is 
the keeper of the gate. About 559–545 b.c.
And  now,  my  beloved  brethren,  I 
have read these things that ye might 
know concerning the a covenants of 
the  Lord  that  he  has  covenanted 
with all the house of Israel—

2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, 
by the mouth of his holy prophets, 
even  from  the  beginning  down, 
from generation to generation, until 
the time comes that they shall be

a restored to the true church and fold 
of God; when they shall be b gathered 
home to the c lands of their inheri-
tance, and shall be established in 
all their lands of promise.

3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I 
speak unto you these things that ye 
may rejoice, and a lift up your heads 
forever,  because  of  the  blessings 
which  the  Lord  God  shall  bestow 
upon your children.

4 For I know that ye have searched 
much,  many  of  you,  to  know  of 
things to come; wherefore I know 
that ye know that our a flesh must 
waste away and die; nevertheless, 
in our b bodies we shall see God.
