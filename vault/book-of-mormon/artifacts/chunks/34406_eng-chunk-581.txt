as one day with God, and time only 
is measured unto men.

9 Therefore,  there  is  a  time  ap-
pointed unto men that they shall 
rise from the dead; and there is a 
space  between  the  time  of  death 
and  the  resurrection.  And  now, 
concerning this space of time, what 
becometh of the souls of men is the 
thing  which  I  have  inquired  dili-
gently  of  the  Lord  to  know;  and 
this is the thing of which I do know.
10 And  when  the  time  cometh 
when all shall rise, then shall they 
know  that  God  a knoweth  all  the 
b times  which  are  appointed  unto 
man.

11 Now, concerning the  a state of 
the  soul  between  b death  and  the 
resurrection—Behold,  it  has  been 
made known unto me by an angel, 
that the spirits of all men, as soon 
as they are departed from this mor-
tal body, yea, the spirits of all men, 
whether they be good or evil, are 
c taken d home to that God who gave 
them life.

12 And then shall it come to pass, 
that  the  spirits  of  those  who  are 
righteous are received into a state  
of  a happiness,  which  is  called 
b paradise, a state of rest, a state of 
c peace, where they shall rest from 
all their troubles and from all care, 
and sorrow.

13 And then shall it come to pass, 
that the a spirits of the wicked, yea, 
who are evil—for behold, they have 
no part nor portion of the Spirit of 
the Lord; for behold, they chose evil 
works rather than good; therefore

the spirit of the b devil did enter into 
them, and take possession of their 
house—and these shall be cast out 
into c outer darkness; there shall be 
d weeping, and wailing, and gnashing 
of teeth, and this because of their 
own iniquity, being led captive by 
the will of the devil.
