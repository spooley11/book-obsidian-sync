Israel will be scattered upon all the face 
of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse 
and nourish Israel with the gospel in 
the last days—Israel will be gathered 
and saved, and the wicked will burn as 
stubble—The kingdom of the devil will 
be destroyed, and Satan will be bound. 
About 588–570 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had read these things which 
were engraven upon the a plates of 
brass, my brethren came unto me 
and said unto me: What b meaneth 
these things which ye have read? 
Behold, are they to be understood 
according to things which are c spiri-
tual, which shall come to pass ac-
cording  to  the  spirit  and  not  the 
flesh?

2 And  I,  Nephi,  said  unto  them: 
Behold  they  were  a manifest  unto 
the  prophet  by  the  voice  of  the 
b Spirit;  for  by  the  Spirit  are  all 
things made known unto the c proph-
ets,  which  shall  come  upon  the 
children  of  men  according  to  the  
flesh.

3 Wherefore, the things of which 
I  have  read  are  things  pertaining 
to things both a temporal and spiri-
tual; for it appears that the house 
of  Israel,  sooner  or  later,  will  be 
b scattered upon all the face of the 
earth, and also c among all nations.

4 And behold, there are many who 
are already lost from the knowledge 
of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, 
the more part of all the a tribes have 
been b led away; and they are c scat-
tered to and fro upon the d isles of 
the sea; and whither they are none 
of us knoweth, save that we know 
that they have been led away.

5 And  since  they  have  been  led 
away, these things have been pro- 
phesied  concerning  them,  and  
also concerning all those who shall 
hereafter be scattered and be con-
founded, because of the Holy One 
of Israel; for against him will they 
a harden  their  hearts;  wherefore, 
they  shall  be  scattered  among 
all nations and shall be  b hated of  
all men.
