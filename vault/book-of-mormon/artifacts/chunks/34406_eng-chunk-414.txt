establish a church in the d land which  
was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the 
land which was called the land of 
Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his 
brethren in the waters of Mormon.
4 And behold, I say unto you, they 
were  a delivered  out  of  the  hands 
of the people of king Noah, by the 
mercy and power of God.

5 And behold, after that, they were 
brought into a bondage by the hands 
of the Lamanites in the wilderness; 
yea,  I  say  unto  you,  they  were  in 
captivity,  and  again  the  Lord  did 
deliver  them  out  of  b bondage  by 
the power of his word; and we were 
brought  into  this  land,  and  here 
we  began  to  establish  the  church 
of God throughout this land also.

6 And now behold, I say unto you, 
my  brethren,  you  that  belong  to 
this church, have you sufficiently 
retained in a remembrance the cap-
tivity of your fathers? Yea, and have 
you sufficiently retained in remem-
brance his mercy and long-suffering 
towards them? And moreover, have 
ye sufficiently retained in remem-
brance that he has b delivered their 
souls from hell?
