2 Wherefore,  the  things  which  I 
have written sufficeth me, save it 
be a few words which I a must speak 
concerning the doctrine of Christ; 
wherefore, I shall speak unto you 
plainly, according to the plainness 
of my prophesying.

3 For my soul delighteth in a plain-
ness; for after this manner doth the 
Lord God work among the children 
of  men.  For  the  Lord  God  giveth 
light unto the b understanding; for 
he  speaketh  unto  men  according 
to  their  c language,  unto  their  un-
derstanding.

4 Wherefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should remember that I have spoken 
unto you concerning that a prophet 
which  the  Lord  showed  unto  me, 
that  should  baptize  the  b Lamb  of 
God, which should take away the 
sins of the world.

5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he 
being  a holy,  should  have  need  to 
be b baptized by water, to fulfil all 
righteousness,  O  then,  how  much 
more need have we, being unholy, 
to be c baptized, yea, even by water!
6 And now, I would ask of you, my 
beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb

of God did fulfil all righteousness 
in being baptized by water?

7 Know ye not that he was holy ? 
But notwithstanding he being holy, 
he  showeth  unto  the  children  of 
men that, according to the flesh he 
humbleth himself before the Father, 
and witnesseth unto the Father that 
he would be a obedient unto him in 
keeping his commandments.

8 Wherefore, after he was baptized 
with water the Holy Ghost descended  
upon him in the a form of a b dove.

9 And again, it showeth unto the 
children of men the straitness of the 
path, and the narrowness of the a gate, 
by which they should enter, he hav-
ing set the b example before them.

10 And he said unto the children 
of  men:  a Follow  thou  me.  Where-
fore, my beloved brethren, can we 
b follow Jesus save we shall be will-
ing to keep the commandments of 
the Father?

11 And the Father said: Repent ye, 
repent ye, and be baptized in the 
name of my Beloved Son.
