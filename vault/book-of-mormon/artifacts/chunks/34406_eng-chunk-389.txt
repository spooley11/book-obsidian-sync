18 Now this account did cause the 
people of Mosiah to mourn exceed-
ingly,  yea,  they  were  filled  with 
sorrow; nevertheless it gave them 
much knowledge, in the which they 
did rejoice.

19 And this account shall be a writ-
ten hereafter; for behold, it is expe-
dient that all people should know 
the  things  which  are  written  in 
this account.

20 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
that  after  king  Mosiah  had  done 
these things, he took the plates of 
a brass,  and  all  the  things  which 
he had kept, and b conferred them  
upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; 
yea,  all  the  records,  and  also  the 
c interpreters, and conferred them 
upon  him,  and  commanded  him 
that he should keep and d preserve 
them, and also keep a record of the 
people, handing them down from

one generation to another, even as 
they had been handed down from 
the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

CHAPTER 29
Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen 
in place of a king—Unrighteous kings 
lead  their  people  into  sin—Alma  the 
younger  is  chosen  chief  judge  by  the 
voice of the people—He is also the high 
priest over the Church—Alma the el-
der and Mosiah die. About 92–91 b.c.
Now  when  Mosiah  had  done  this 
he sent out throughout all the land, 
among  all  the  people,  desiring  to 
know  their  will  concerning  who 
should be their king.

2 And it came to pass that the voice 
of the people came, saying: We are 
desirous that Aaron thy son should 
be our king and our ruler.
