3 And  ye  shall  a tread  down  the 
wicked; for they shall be ashes un-
der the soles of your feet in the day 
that I shall do this, saith the Lord 
of Hosts.

4 Remember ye the law of Moses, 
my  servant,  which  I  commanded 
unto him in  a Horeb for all Israel, 
with the statutes and judgments.

5 Behold, I will send you a Elijah 
the  prophet  before  the  coming 
of the great and dreadful  b day of  
the Lord;

6 And he shall a turn the heart of 
the  b fathers  to  the  children,  and 
the  heart  of  the  children  to  their 
fathers, lest I come and c smite the 
earth with a curse.

CHAPTER 26
Jesus expounds all things from the be-
ginning to the end—Babes and children 
utter marvelous things that cannot be 
written—Those in the Church of Christ 
have all things in common among them. 
About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that when 
Jesus had told these things he ex-
pounded them unto the multitude; 
and he did expound all things unto 
them, both great and small.

2 And he saith: a These scriptures, 
which  ye  had  not  with  you,  the 
Father  commanded  that  I  should 
give  unto  you;  for  it  was  wisdom 
in him that they should be given 
unto future generations.

3 And he did expound all things, 
even from the beginning until the 
a time  that  he  should  come  in  his 
b glory—yea, even all things which 
should come upon the face of the 
earth,  even  until  the  c elements 
should melt with fervent heat, and 
the earth should be d wrapt together 
as a scroll, and the heavens and the 
earth should pass away;

4 And even unto the a great and last 
day, when all people, and all kin-
dreds, and all nations and tongues 
shall b stand before God, to be judged
