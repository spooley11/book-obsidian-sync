is b none other way nor c name given 
under heaven whereby man can be 
saved in the kingdom of God. And 
now,  behold,  this  is  the  d doctrine 
of  Christ,  and  the  only  and  true 
doctrine of the e Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which 
is f one God, without end. Amen.

CHAPTER 32

Angels speak by the power of the Holy 
Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowl-
edge for themselves from the Holy Ghost. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I suppose that ye ponder some-
what in your hearts concerning that 
which ye should do after ye have 
entered in by the way. But, behold, 
why do ye ponder these things in 
your hearts?

2 Do ye not remember that I said 
unto you that after ye had a received 
the Holy Ghost ye could speak with 
the b tongue of angels? And now, how 
could ye speak with the tongue of  
angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
3 a Angels  speak  by  the  power  of 
the  Holy  Ghost;  wherefore,  they 
speak the words of Christ. Where-
fore,  I  said  unto  you,  b feast  upon  
the c words of Christ; for behold, the  
words  of  Christ  will  d tell  you  all 
things what ye should do.

4 Wherefore,  now  after  I  have 
spoken  these  words,  if  ye  cannot  
understand them it will be because 
ye  a ask  not,  neither  do  ye  knock; 
wherefore, ye are not brought into

the  light,  but  must  perish  in  the 
dark.

5 For behold, again I say unto you 
that if ye will enter in by the way, 
and receive the Holy Ghost, it will 
a show unto you all things what ye 
should do.

6 Behold,  this  is  the  doctrine  of 
Christ, and there will be no more 
doctrine given until after he shall 
a manifest himself unto you in the 
flesh. And when he shall manifest 
himself unto you in the flesh, the 
things which he shall say unto you 
shall ye observe to do.
