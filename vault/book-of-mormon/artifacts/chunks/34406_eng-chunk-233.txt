8 Wherefore, we would to God that 
we could persuade all men a not to 
rebel against God, to b provoke him 
to anger, but that all men would be-
lieve in Christ, and view his death, 
and suffer his  c cross and bear the 
shame  of  the  world;  wherefore,  I,

Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the  
commandment of my brother Nephi.
9 Now  Nephi  began  to  be  old, 
and he saw that he must soon a die; 
wherefore, he b anointed a man to be 
a king and a ruler over his people  
now, according to the reigns of the 
c kings.

10 The people having loved Nephi 
exceedingly, he having been a great 
protector for them, having wielded 
the a sword of Laban in their defence, 
and having labored in all his days 
for their welfare—

11 Wherefore, the people were de-
sirous to retain in remembrance his 
name. And whoso should reign in 
his stead were called by the people, 
second Nephi, third Nephi, and so 
forth, according to the reigns of the 
kings; and thus they were called by 
the people, let them be of whatever 
name they would.

12 And it came to pass that Nephi

died.

13 Now the people which were not 
a Lamanites  were  Nephites;  never-
theless, they were called Nephites, 
Jacobites,  Josephites,  b Zoramites, 
Lamanites,  Lemuelites,  and  Ish-
maelites.

14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter 
distinguish a them by these names, 
but  I  shall  b call  them  Lamanites 
that seek to destroy the people of 
Nephi, and those who are friendly 
to Nephi I shall call  c Nephites, or 
the d people of Nephi, according to 
the reigns of the kings.
