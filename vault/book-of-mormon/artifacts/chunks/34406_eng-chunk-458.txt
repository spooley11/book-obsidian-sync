And  again,  my  brethren,  I  would 
cite your minds forward to the time 
when the Lord God gave these com-
mandments unto his children; and 
I would that ye should remember 
that the Lord God a ordained priests, 
after his holy order, which was after 
the order of his Son, to teach these 
things unto the people.

2 And those priests were ordained 
after  the  a order  of  his  Son,  in  a 
b manner  that  thereby  the  people 
might know in what manner to look 
forward to his Son for redemption.
3 And  this  is  the  manner  after 
which they were ordained—being 
a called  and  b prepared  from  the 
c foundation of the world according 
to the d foreknowledge of God, on ac-
count of their exceeding faith and 
good works; in the first place being 
left to e choose good or evil; there-
fore they having chosen good, and

exercising exceedingly great f faith, 
are g called with a holy calling, yea, 
with  that  holy  calling  which  was 
prepared with, and according to, a 
preparatory redemption for such.

4 And thus they have been a called 
to this holy calling on account of 
their faith, while others would re-
ject  the  Spirit  of  God  on  account 
of the hardness of their hearts and 
b blindness of their minds, while, if 
it had not been for this they might 
have had as great c privilege as their 
brethren.

5 Or in fine, in the first place they 
were  on  the  a same  standing  with 
their brethren; thus this holy calling 
being prepared from the foundation 
of the world for such as would not 
harden their hearts, being in and 
through the atonement of the Only 
Begotten Son, who was prepared—
6 And  thus  being  called  by  this 
holy calling, and ordained unto the 
high priesthood of the holy order of 
God, to teach his commandments 
unto the children of men, that they 
also might enter into his a rest—

7 This high priesthood being after 
the order of his Son, which order was 
from the foundation of the world; 
or in other words, being  a without 
beginning of days or end of years, 
being  prepared  from  b eternity  to 
all eternity, according to his c fore-
knowledge of all things—
