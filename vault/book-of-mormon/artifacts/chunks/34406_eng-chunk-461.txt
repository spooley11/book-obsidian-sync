ALMA 13  : 21–31

before you; if ye will b wrest them 
it shall be to your own destruction.
21 And now it came to pass that 
when  Alma  had  said  these  words 
unto them, he stretched forth his 
hand unto them and cried with a 
mighty  voice,  saying:  a Now  is  the 
time to repent, for the day of sal-
vation draweth nigh;

22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, 
by the  a mouth of angels, doth de-
clare it unto all nations; yea, doth 
declare it, that they may have glad 
tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth 
sound these glad tidings among all 
his people, yea, even to them that 
are scattered abroad upon the face 
of the earth; wherefore they have 
come unto us.

23 And they are made known unto 
us in a plain terms, that we may un-
derstand, that we cannot err; and 
this because of our being b wander-
ers in a strange land; therefore, we 
are thus highly favored, for we have 
these glad tidings declared unto us 
in all parts of our vineyard.

24 For behold, a angels are declar-
ing it unto many at this time in our 
land; and this is for the purpose of 
preparing the hearts of the children 
of men to receive his word at the 
time of his coming in his glory.

25 And now we only wait to hear 
the  joyful  news  declared  unto  us 
by the mouth of angels, of his com-
ing; for the time cometh, we a know 
not how soon. Would to God that 
it might be in my day; but let it be 
sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
26 And it shall be made known unto 
a just and holy men, by the mouth 
of angels, at the time of his coming,
