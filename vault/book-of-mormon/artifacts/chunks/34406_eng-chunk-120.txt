a purposes in the end of man, after 
he  had  b created  our  first  parents, 
and the beasts of the field and the 
c fowls  of  the  air,  and  in  fine,  all 
things  which  are  created,  it  must 
needs be that there was an opposi-
tion; even the d forbidden e fruit in 
f opposition to the g tree of life; the 
one being sweet and the other bitter.
16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave 
unto  man  that  he  should  a act  for 
himself. Wherefore, man could not 
b act  for  himself  save  it  should  be 
that he was c enticed by the one or 
the other.

17 And  I,  Lehi,  according  to  the 
things which I have read, must needs 
suppose that an a angel of God, ac-
cording to that which is written, had 
b fallen from heaven; wherefore, he 
became a c devil, having sought that 
which was evil before God.

18 And because he had fallen from 
heaven, and had become miserable 
forever, he a sought also the misery 
of all mankind. Wherefore, he said 
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, 
who is the devil, who is the father 
of all b lies, wherefore he said: Par-
take of the forbidden fruit, and ye 
shall not die, but ye shall be as God, 
c knowing good and evil.

19 And after Adam and Eve had 
a partaken  of  the  forbidden  fruit 
they were driven out of the garden 
of b Eden, to till the earth.
