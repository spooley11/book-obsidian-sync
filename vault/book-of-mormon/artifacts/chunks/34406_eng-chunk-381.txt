Mosiah forbids persecution and enjoins 
equality—Alma  the  younger  and  the 
four  sons  of  Mosiah  seek  to  destroy 
the  Church—An  angel  appears  and 
commands  them  to  cease  their  evil 
course—Alma  is  struck  dumb—All 
mankind must be born again to gain 
salvation —Alma  and  the  sons  of 
Mosiah  declare  glad  tidings.  About 
100–92 b.c.

And now it came to pass that the 
persecutions which were inflicted 
on the church by the unbelievers 
became  so  great  that  the  church 
began  to  murmur,  and  complain 
to  their  leaders  concerning  the 
matter; and they did complain to 
Alma. And Alma laid the case be-
fore their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah 
a consulted with his priests.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Mosiah sent a proclamation through-
out the land round about that there 
should not any unbeliever a perse-
cute any of those who belonged to 
the church of God.

3 And there was a strict command 
throughout  all  the  churches  that 
there  should  be  no  a persecutions 
among them, that there should be 
an b equality among all men;

4 That they should let no pride nor 
haughtiness  disturb  their  a peace; 
that every man should b esteem his

c neighbor as himself, d laboring with 
their own hands for their support.
5 Yea,  and  all  their  priests  and 
teachers a should b labor with their 
own  hands  for  their  support,  in 
all  cases  save  it  were  in  sickness, 
or in much want; and doing these 
things, they did abound in the c grace  
of God.

6 And  there  began  to  be  much 
peace  again  in  the  land;  and  the 
people began to be very numerous,  
and began to scatter abroad upon the  
face of the earth, yea, on the north 
and on the south, on the east and on 
the west, building large cities and 
villages in all quarters of the land.
7 And the Lord did a visit them and 
b prosper them, and they became a 
large and wealthy people.
