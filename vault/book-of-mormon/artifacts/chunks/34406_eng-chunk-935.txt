25 For it cometh to pass that whoso 
buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow 
the a freedom of all lands, nations, 
and  countries;  and  it  bringeth  to 
pass the destruction of all people, 
for it is built up by the devil, who is  
the father of all lies; even that same 
liar who b beguiled our first parents, 
yea, even that same liar who hath 
caused man to commit murder from 
the beginning; who hath c hardened  
the  hearts  of  men  that  they  have 
d murdered the prophets, and stoned 
them, and cast them out from the 
beginning.

26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am com-
manded to write these things that 
evil  may  be  done  away,  and  that 
the time may come that Satan may 
have a no power upon the hearts of 
the children of men, but that they 
may be b persuaded to do good con-
tinually, that they may come unto 
the  fountain  of  all  c righteousness 
and be saved.

CHAPTER 9
The kingdom passes from one to another 
by  descent,  intrigue,  and  murder—

Emer saw the Son of Righteousness—
Many  prophets  cry  repentance —A 
famine and poisonous serpents plague  
the people.

And  now  I,  Moroni,  proceed  with 
my  record.  Therefore,  behold,  it 
came  to  pass  that  because  of  the 
a secret combinations of Akish and 
his friends, behold, they did over-
throw the kingdom of Omer.

2 Nevertheless, the Lord was mer-
ciful unto Omer, and also to his sons 
and to his daughters who did not 
seek his destruction.

3 And  the  Lord  a warned  Omer 
in a dream that he should depart 
out  of  the  land;  wherefore  Omer 
b departed out of the land with his 
family, and traveled many days, and 
came over and passed by the hill of 
c Shim, and came over by the place 
d where the Nephites were destroyed, 
and  from  thence  eastward,  and 
came to a place which was called 
Ablom, by the seashore, and there 
he  pitched  his  tent,  and  also  his 
sons and his daughters, and all his 
household, save it were Jared and  
his family.
