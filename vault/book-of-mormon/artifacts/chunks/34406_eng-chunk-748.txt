38 But behold, your a days of pro-
bation are past; ye have  b procras-
tinated  the  day  of  your  salvation 
until it is everlastingly too late, and 
your destruction is made sure; yea, 
for ye have sought all the days of 
your lives for that which ye could 
not obtain; and ye have sought for 
c happiness in doing iniquity, which 
thing is d contrary to the nature of 
that righteousness which is in our 
great and Eternal Head.

39 O  ye  people  of  the  land,  that 
ye  would  hear  my  words!  And  I 
pray that the anger of the Lord be 
turned away from you, and that ye 
would repent and be saved.

CHAPTER 14

Samuel predicts light during the night 
and a new star at Christ’s birth—Christ 
redeems men from temporal and spir-
itual  death—The  signs  of  His  death 
include three days of darkness, the rend-
ing of the rocks, and great upheavals 
of nature. About 6 b.c.
And now it came to pass that a Sam-
uel,  the  Lamanite,  did  prophesy 
a  great  many  more  things  which 
cannot be written.

2 And behold, he said unto them: 
Behold, I give unto you a sign; for 
a five  years  more  cometh,  and  be-
hold, then cometh the Son of God

you  for  a  a sign  at  the  time  of  his 
coming; for behold, there shall be 
great  lights  in  heaven,  insomuch

there shall be no darkness, insomuch 
that it shall appear unto man as if 
it was day.
