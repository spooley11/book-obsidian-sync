12 And  now,  when  Amulek  had 
spoken these words the people be-
gan to be astonished, seeing there 
was  a more  than  one  witness  who 
testified of the things whereof they 
were accused, and also of the things 
which were to come, according to 
the  spirit  of  prophecy  which  was 
in them.

13 Nevertheless, there were some 
among them who thought to ques-

a devices they might catch them in 
their words, that they might b find

might deliver them to their judges 
that they might be judged accord-
ing to the law, and that they might 
be slain or cast into prison, accord-
ing to the crime which they could 
make  appear  or  witness  against

14 Now  it  was  those  men  who

a lawyers,  who  were  hired  or  ap-

or at the trials of the crimes of the 
people before the judges.

people; and this was to enable them 
that they might be skilful in their 
profession.

began  to  question  Amulek,  that 
thereby they might make him a cross 
his words, or contradict the words 
which he should speak.
