first began to preach to the Amale-
kites.  And  he  began  to  preach  to 
them in their a synagogues, for they 
had built synagogues after the b or-
der of the Nehors; for many of the 
Amalekites  and  the  Amulonites 
were after the order of the Nehors.
5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into 
one of their a synagogues to preach 
unto  the  people,  and  as  he  was 
speaking unto them, behold there 
arose  an  Amalekite  and  began  to 
contend with him, saying: What is 
that thou hast testified? Hast thou 
seen an b angel? Why do not angels 
appear  unto  us?  Behold  c are  not 
this people as good as thy people?
6 Thou also sayest, except we re-
pent we shall perish. How knowest 
thou the thought and intent of our 
hearts? How knowest thou that we 
have cause to repent? How knowest 
thou that we are not a a righteous peo-
ple? Behold, we have built b sanctu-
aries, and we do assemble ourselves  
together  to  worship  c God.  We  do 
believe that God will save all men.
7 Now Aaron said unto him: Be-
lievest  thou  that  the  Son  of  God 
shall  come  to  redeem  mankind 
from their sins?

8 And the man said unto him: We 
do not a believe that thou knowest 
any such thing. We do not believe 
in these foolish traditions. We do 
not  believe  that  thou  knowest  of 
things to come, neither do we be-
lieve that thy fathers and also that 
our  fathers  did  know  concerning 
the things which they spake, of that 
which is to come.

9 Now  Aaron  began  to  open  the 
a scriptures  unto  them  concern-
ing the coming of Christ, and also 
concerning the resurrection of the 
dead, and that there could be  b no 
redemption  for  mankind  c save  it

were through the d death and suffer-
ings of Christ, and the atonement of  
his blood.
