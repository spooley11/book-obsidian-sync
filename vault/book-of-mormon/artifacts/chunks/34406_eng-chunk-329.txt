Abinadi, and they sought from that 
time forward to take him. And king 
Noah  hardened  his  heart  against 
the  word  of  the  Lord,  and  he  did 
not repent of his evil doings.

CHAPTER 12
Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying 
the  destruction  of  the  people  and  the 
death of King Noah—The false priests 
quote the scriptures and pretend to keep 
the  law  of  Moses—Abinadi  begins  to 
teach  them  the  Ten  Commandments. 
About 148 b.c.
And it came to pass that after the 
space of two years that Abinadi came 
among them in disguise, that they 
knew him not, and began to a proph-
esy among them, saying: Thus has 
the Lord commanded me, saying— 
Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this 
my people, for they have hardened 
their hearts against my words; they 
have repented not of their evil do-
ings; therefore, I will b visit them in 
my anger, yea, in my fierce anger 
will I visit them in their iniquities 
and abominations.
