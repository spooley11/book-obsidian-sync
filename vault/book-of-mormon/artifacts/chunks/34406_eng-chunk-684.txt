33 And the armies of the Laman-
ites were all gathered together, in-
somuch that they were all in one 
body  in  the  land  of  Moroni.  Now 
Ammoron, the king of the Laman-
ites, was also with them.

34 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and Lehi and Teancum did encamp 
with their armies round about in 
the borders of the land of Moroni, 
insomuch that the Lamanites were 
encircled about in the borders by 
the  wilderness  on  the  south,  and  
in the borders by the wilderness on  
the east.

35 And thus they did encamp for 
the  night.  For  behold,  the  Neph-
ites  and  the  Lamanites  also  were

weary because of the greatness of 
the march; therefore they did not 
resolve upon any stratagem in the 
night-time, save it were Teancum; 
for he was exceedingly angry with 
Ammoron, insomuch that he con-
sidered that Ammoron, and Amal-
ickiah  his  brother,  had  been  the 
a cause of this great and lasting war 
between them and the Lamanites, 
which had been the cause of so much 
war  and  bloodshed,  yea,  and  so  
much famine.

36 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum in his anger did go forth into 
the camp of the Lamanites, and did 
let himself down over the walls of 
the city. And he went forth with a 
cord, from place to place, insomuch 
that he did find the king; and he 
did  a cast  a  javelin  at  him,  which 
did pierce him near the heart. But 
behold,  the  king  did  awaken  his 
servants before he died, insomuch 
that they did pursue Teancum, and 
slew him.

37 Now it came to pass that when 
Lehi and Moroni knew that Tean-
cum was dead they were exceedingly  
sorrowful; for behold, he had been 
a  man  who  had  a fought  valiantly 
for his country, yea, a true friend 
to liberty; and he had suffered very 
many exceedingly sore afflictions. 
But behold, he was dead, and had 
gone the way of all the earth.

38 Now it came to pass that Mo-
roni marched forth on the morrow, 
and came upon the Lamanites, inso-
much that they did slay them with 
a great slaughter; and they did drive 
them out of the land; and they did 
flee, even that they did not return 
at that time against the Nephites.
