7 Yea, and they also became idola-
trous, because they were deceived 
by the vain and flattering words of 
the king and priests; for they did 
speak flattering things unto them.
8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Noah built many elegant and spa-
cious buildings; and he ornamented 
them with fine work of wood, and 
of all manner of a precious things, of 
gold, and of silver, and of iron, and 
of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;
9 And he also built him a spacious 
palace, and a throne in the midst 
thereof, all of which was of fine wood  
and was ornamented with gold and 
silver and with precious things.

10 And  he  also  caused  that  his 
workmen should work all manner 
of  fine  work  within  the  walls  of 
the  a temple,  of  fine  wood,  and  of 
copper, and of brass.

11 And the seats which were set

apart for the  a high priests, which 
were above all the other seats, he 
did ornament with pure gold; and 
he caused a breastwork to be built 
before them, that they might rest 
their bodies and their arms upon 
while they should speak lying and 
vain words to his people.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
built a a tower near the temple; yea, 
a very high tower, even so high that 
he could stand upon the top thereof 
and overlook the land of b Shilom, 
and also the land of c Shemlon, which 
was  possessed  by  the  Lamanites; 
and he could even look over all the 
land round about.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
caused many buildings to be built 
in the land Shilom; and he caused a 
great tower to be built on the a hill 
north  of  the  land  Shilom,  which 
had been a resort for the children 
of Nephi at the time they b fled out 
of the land; and thus he did do with 
the riches which he obtained by the 
taxation of his people.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
placed  his  heart  upon  his  riches, 
and  he  spent  his  time  in  a riotous 
living with his wives and his con-
cubines; and so did also his priests 
spend their time with harlots.
