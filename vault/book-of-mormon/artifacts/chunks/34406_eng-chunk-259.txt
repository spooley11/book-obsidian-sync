77 And when the time cometh that  
evil fruit shall again come into my 
vineyard, then will I cause the a good 
and the bad to be gathered; and the 
good will I preserve unto myself, and  
the bad will I cast away into its own 
place. And then cometh the b season 
and the end; and my vineyard will 
I cause to be c burned with d fire.

CHAPTER 6

The Lord will recover Israel in the last 
days—The world will be burned with 
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid 
the lake of fire and brimstone. About 
544–421 b.c.

And now, behold, my brethren, as I 
said unto you that I would proph-
esy, behold, this is my prophecy—
that the things which this prophet 
a Zenos spake, concerning the house 
of Israel, in the which he likened 
them unto a tame b olive tree, must 
surely come to pass.

2 And  the  day  that  he  shall  set 
his hand again the second time to 
a recover his people, is the day, yea, 
even  the  last  time,  that  the  b ser-
vants of the Lord shall go forth in 
his  c power, to  d nourish and prune 
his  e vineyard;  and  after  that  the 
f end soon cometh.

3 And how a blessed are they who 
have labored b diligently in his vine-
yard; and how c cursed are they who  
shall  be  cast  out  into  their  own 
place!  And  the  d world  shall  be 
e burned with fire.

4 And  how  merciful  is  our  God 
unto  us,  for  he  remembereth  the 
house  of  a Israel,  both  roots  and 
branches; and he stretches forth his 
b hands unto them all the day long; 
and they are a  c stiffnecked and a 
gainsaying people; but as many as 
will not harden their hearts shall 
be saved in the kingdom of God.

5 Wherefore,  my  beloved  breth-
ren,  I  beseech  of  you  in  words  of 
soberness that ye would repent, and 
come  with  full  purpose  of  heart, 
and a cleave unto God as he cleaveth 
unto  you.  And  while  his  b arm  of 
mercy is extended towards you in
