13 And now behold, this was the 
desire which I desired of him—that 
if it should so be, that my people, 
the Nephites, should fall into trans-
gression, and by any means be a de-
stroyed, and the Lamanites should 
not  be  b destroyed,  that  the  Lord 
God  would  c preserve  a  record  of 
my people, the Nephites; even if it 
so be by the power of his holy arm, 
that it might be  d brought forth at 
some future day unto the Laman-
ites,  that,  perhaps,  they  might  be 
e brought unto salvation—

14 For  at  the  present  our  strug-
glings were a vain in restoring them 
to the true faith. And they swore in 
their wrath that, if it were possible, 
they  would  b destroy  our  records 
and us, and also all the traditions 
of our fathers.

15 Wherefore, I knowing that the 
Lord God was able to a preserve our 
records, I cried unto him continu-
ally, for he had said unto me: What-
soever thing ye shall ask in faith, 
believing that ye shall receive in the 
name of Christ, ye shall receive it.
16 And I had faith, and I did cry 
unto God that he would a preserve 
the  b records;  and  he  covenanted 
with me that he would c bring d them 
forth unto the Lamanites in his own 
due time.

17 And I, Enos, a knew it would be 
according  to  the  covenant  which 
he  had  made;  wherefore  my  soul 
did rest.

18 And  the  Lord  said  unto  me: 
Thy fathers have also required of 
me this thing; and it shall be done 
unto them according to their faith; 
for their faith was like unto thine.
19 And now it came to pass that I, 
Enos, went about among the people 
of Nephi, prophesying of things to 
come, and testifying of the things 
which I had heard and seen.
