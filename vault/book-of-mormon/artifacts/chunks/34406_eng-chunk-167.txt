16 Moreover,  the  Lord  saith:  Be-
cause  the  daughters  of  Zion  are 
a haughty, and b walk with stretched-
forth necks and wanton eyes, walk-
ing  and  mincing  as  they  go,  and 
making a tinkling with their feet—
17 Therefore the Lord will smite 
with a a scab the crown of the head 
of the daughters of Zion, and the 
Lord  will  b discover  their  secret  
parts.

18 In that a day the Lord will take 
away the bravery of their tinkling 
ornaments,  and  cauls,  and  round 
tires like the moon;

19 The chains and the bracelets,

and the mufflers;

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments 
of the legs, and the headbands, and 
the tablets, and the ear-rings;

21 The rings, and nose jewels;
22 The changeable suits of apparel, 
and the mantles, and the wimples, 
and the crisping-pins;

23 The glasses, and the fine linen,

and hoods, and the veils.

24 And it shall come to pass, in-
stead of sweet smell there shall be 
stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; 
and instead of well set hair, a bald-
ness; and instead of a stomacher, a 
girding of sackcloth;  b burning in-
stead of c beauty.

25 Thy men shall fall by the sword

and thy mighty in the war.

26 And her a gates shall lament and 
b mourn; and she shall be desolate, 
and shall c sit upon the ground.

CHAPTER 14
Zion and her daughters will be redeemed 
and cleansed in the millennial day—
Compare Isaiah 4. About 559–545 b.c.
a And in that day, seven women shall 
take hold of one man, saying: We 
will eat our own bread, and wear 
our  own  apparel;  only  let  us  be 
called  by  thy  name  to  take  away 
our b reproach.

2 In that day shall the a branch of 
the Lord be beautiful and glorious; 
the fruit of the earth excellent and
