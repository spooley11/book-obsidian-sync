4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in 
God might with  a surety  b hope for 
a better world, yea, even a place at 
the right hand of God, which c hope 
cometh of d faith, maketh an e anchor 
to the souls of men, which would 
make them sure and steadfast, al-
ways  abounding  in  f good  works, 
being led to g glorify God.

5 And it came to pass that Ether 
did prophesy great and marvelous 
things unto the people, which they 
did not believe, because they a saw 
them not.

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak 
somewhat concerning these things; 
I would show unto the world that 
a faith  is  things  which  are  b hoped 
for  and  c not  seen;  wherefore,  dis-
pute not because ye see not, for ye 
receive no d witness until after the 
e trial of your faith.

7 For  it  was  by  faith  that  Christ 
showed  himself  unto  our  fathers, 
after he had risen from the dead; 
and  he  showed  not  himself  unto 
them  until  after  they  had  faith 
in  him;  wherefore,  it  must  needs

be  that  some  had  faith  in  him, 
for  he  showed  himself  a not  unto  
the world.

8 But because of the faith of men 
he  has  shown  himself  unto  the 
world,  and  glorified  the  name  of 
the Father, and prepared a way that 
thereby others might be partakers 
of the heavenly gift, that they might 
hope for those things which they 
have not seen.

9 Wherefore,  ye  may  also  have 
hope, and be partakers of the gift, 
if ye will but have faith.

10 Behold it was by faith that they 
of old were  a called after the holy 
order of God.

11 Wherefore, by faith was the law 
of Moses given. But in the a gift of 
his Son hath God prepared a more 
b excellent  way;  and  it  is  by  faith 
that it hath been fulfilled.

12 For if there be no a faith among 
the children of men God can do no 
b miracle  among  them;  wherefore, 
he showed not himself until after 
their faith.

13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma 
and Amulek that caused the a prison 
to tumble to the earth.

14 Behold,  it  was  the  faith  of 
Nephi and Lehi that wrought the 
a change upon the Lamanites, that 
they  were  baptized  with  fire  and 
with the b Holy Ghost.
