CHAPTER 46
Amalickiah conspires to be king—Mo-
roni raises the title of liberty—He rallies 
the  people  to  defend  their  religion—
True believers are called Christians—A 
remnant of Joseph will be preserved—
Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to 
the land of Nephi—Those who will not 
support the cause of freedom are put to 
death. About 73–72 b.c.

And it came to pass that as many 
as would not hearken to the a words 
of Helaman and his brethren were 
gathered  together  against  their 
brethren.

2 And now behold, they were ex-
ceedingly  wroth,  insomuch  that 
they were determined to slay them.
3 Now  the  leader  of  those  who 
were wroth against their brethren 
was a large and a strong man; and 
his name was a Amalickiah.

4 And Amalickiah was desirous to 
be a  a king; and those people who 
were wroth were also desirous that

he should be their king; and they 
were the greater part of them the 
lower b judges of the land, and they 
were seeking for power.

5 And  they  had  been  led  by  the 
a flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they 
would  support  him  and  establish 
him to be their king that he would 
make them rulers over the people.
6 Thus  they  were  led  away  by 
Amalickiah to dissensions, notwith-
standing the preaching of Helaman 
and  his  brethren,  yea,  notwith-
standing  their  exceedingly  great 
care over the church, for they were 
a high priests over the church.

7 And  there  were  many  in  the 
church who believed in the  a flat-
tering words of Amalickiah, there-
fore they b dissented even from the 
church; and thus were the affairs 
of  the  people  of  Nephi  exceed-
ingly  precarious  and  dangerous, 
notwithstanding  their  great  c vic-
tory which they had had over the 
Lamanites, and their great rejoic-
ings which they had had because 
of their d deliverance by the hand of  
the Lord.

8 Thus we see how a quick the chil-
dren of men do b forget the Lord their 
God, yea, how quick to do c iniquity, 
and to be led away by the evil one.
9 Yea,  and  we  also  see  the  great 
a wickedness one very wicked man 
can cause to take place among the 
children of men.
