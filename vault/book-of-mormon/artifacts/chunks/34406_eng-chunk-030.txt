4 And  it  had  come  to  pass  that 
my father spake unto her, saying: 
I know that I am a a visionary man; 
for if I had not seen the things of 
God in a b vision I should not have 
known  the  goodness  of  God,  but 
had tarried at Jerusalem, and had 
perished with my brethren.

5 But  behold,  I  have  a obtained  a 
b land of promise, in the which things 
I do rejoice; yea, and I  c know that 
the Lord will deliver my sons out of 
the hands of Laban, and bring them 
down again unto us in the wilderness.
6 And  after  this  manner  of  lan-
guage did my father, Lehi, a comfort 
my mother, Sariah, concerning us, 
while we journeyed in the wilder-
ness  up  to  the  land  of  Jerusalem, 
to obtain the record of the Jews.

7 And when we had returned to 
the tent of my father, behold their 
joy  was  full,  and  my  mother  was 
comforted.

8 And  she  spake,  saying:  Now  I 
know of a surety that the Lord hath 
a commanded my husband to b flee 
into the wilderness; yea, and I also 
know of a surety that the Lord hath 
protected  my  sons,  and  delivered 
them  out  of  the  hands  of  Laban, 
and  given  them  power  whereby 
they  could  c accomplish  the  thing 
which the Lord hath commanded 
them.  And  after  this  manner  of 
language did she speak.

9 And it came to pass that they did 
rejoice exceedingly, and did offer 
a sacrifice and burnt offerings unto 
the  Lord;  and  they  gave  b thanks 
unto the God of Israel.

10 And after they had given thanks 
unto the God of Israel, my father, 
Lehi, took the records which were 
engraven upon the a plates of brass, 
and he did search them from the 
beginning.

11 And  he  beheld  that  they  did 
contain  the  five  a books  of  Moses, 
which gave an account of the cre-
ation of the world, and also of Adam 
and Eve, who were our first parents;
