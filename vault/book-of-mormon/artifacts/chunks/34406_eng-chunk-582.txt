14 Now  this  is  the  state  of  the 
a souls of the b wicked, yea, in dark-
ness, and a state of awful, c fearful 
looking for the fiery d indignation of 
the wrath of God upon them; thus 
they remain in this  e state, as well 
as the righteous in paradise, until 
the time of their resurrection.

15 Now, there are some that have 
understood that this state of happi-
ness and this state of misery of the 
soul,  before  the  resurrection,  was 
a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it 
may be termed a resurrection, the 
a raising of the spirit or the soul and 
their  consignation  to  happiness 
or misery, according to the words 
which have been spoken.

16 And behold, again it hath been 
spoken, that there is a a first b resur-
rection, a resurrection of all those 
who have been, or who are, or who 
shall be, down to the resurrection 
of Christ from the dead.

17 Now,  we  do  not  suppose  that 
this first resurrection, which is spo-
ken of in this manner, can be the 
resurrection of the souls and their 
a consignation to happiness or mis-
ery. Ye cannot suppose that this is 
what it meaneth.

18 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Nay; 
but it meaneth the a reuniting of the
