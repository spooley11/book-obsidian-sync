27 And it came to pass that when 
two  hundred  and  ten  years  had 
passed  away  there  were  many 
churches in the land; yea, there were 
many churches which professed to 
know the Christ, and yet they did 
a deny the more parts of his gospel, 
insomuch that they did receive all 
manner of wickedness, and did ad-
minister that which was sacred unto 
him to whom it had been b forbidden  
because of unworthiness.

28 And this church did multiply 
exceedingly  because  of  iniquity, 
and because of the power of a Satan 
who did get hold upon their b hearts.
29 And again, there was another 
church  which  denied  the  Christ; 
and  they  did  a persecute  the  true 
b church of Christ, because of their 
humility and their belief in Christ; 
and they did despise them because 
of the many miracles which were 
wrought among them.

30 Therefore  they  did  exercise  
power and authority over the dis-
ciples of Jesus who did tarry with

them, and they did cast them into 
a prison;  but  by  the  power  of  the 
word of God, which was in them, 
the prisons were rent in twain, and 
they went forth doing mighty mir-
acles among them.

31 Nevertheless, and notwithstand-
ing all these miracles, the people 
did  harden  their  hearts,  and  did 
seek to kill them, even as the Jews 
at  Jerusalem  sought  to  kill  Jesus, 
according to his word.

32 And  they  did  cast  them  into 
a furnaces  of  b fire,  and  they  came 
forth receiving no harm.

33 And  they  also  cast  them  into 
a dens of wild beasts, and they did 
play with the wild beasts even as a 
child with a lamb; and they did come 
forth from among them, receiving  
no harm.

34 Nevertheless,  the  people  did 
harden their hearts, for they were 
led  by  many  priests  and  a false 
prophets to build up many churches, 
and to do all manner of iniquity. 
And they did b smite upon the peo-
ple of Jesus; but the people of Jesus 
did not smite again. And thus they 
did dwindle in unbelief and wick-
edness, from year to year, even until 
two hundred and thirty years had  
passed away.

35 And now it came to pass in this 
year, yea, in the two hundred and 
thirty  and  first  year,  there  was  a 
great division among the people.
