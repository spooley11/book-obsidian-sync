18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come out with their 
numerous  army  against  us.  And 
when they had come and were about 
to  fall  upon  us  with  the  sword,  I 
caused  that  my  men,  those  who 
were with me, should retreat into 
the wilderness.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did follow after us with 
great speed, for they were exceed-
ingly desirous to overtake us that 
they might slay us; therefore they did 
follow us into the wilderness; and we 
did pass by in the midst of Gid and 
Teomner, insomuch that they were  
not discovered by the Lamanites.

20 And it came to pass that when 
the  Lamanites  had  passed  by,  or 
when the army had passed by, Gid 
and Teomner did rise up from their 
secret  places,  and  did  cut  off  the 
spies  of  the  Lamanites  that  they 
should not return to the city.

21 And it came to pass that when 
they had cut them off, they ran to 
the city and fell upon the guards 
who were left to guard the city, in-
somuch that they did destroy them 
and did take possession of the city.
22 Now this was done because the 
Lamanites  did  suffer  their  whole 
army, save a few guards only, to be 
led away into the wilderness.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Gid 
and  Teomner  by  this  means  had 
obtained possession of their strong-
holds. And it came to pass that we 
took our course, after having trav-
eled much in the wilderness towards 
the land of Zarahemla.

24 And when the Lamanites saw 
that  they  were  marching  towards 
the land of Zarahemla, they were 
exceedingly afraid, lest there was 
a plan laid to lead them on to de-
struction; therefore they began to 
retreat into the wilderness again, 
yea,  even  back  by  the  same  way 
which they had come.

25 And behold, it was night and 
they did pitch their tents, for the 
chief  a captains  of  the  Lamanites 
had  supposed  that  the  Nephites 
were weary because of their march; 
and supposing that they had driven 
their  whole  army  therefore  they 
took  no  thought  concerning  the 
city of Manti.
