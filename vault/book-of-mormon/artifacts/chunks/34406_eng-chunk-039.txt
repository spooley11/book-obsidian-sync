19 And I beheld a a rod of iron, and 
it extended along the bank of the 
river, and led to the tree by which 
I stood.

20 And I also beheld a a strait and 
narrow path, which came along by 
the rod of iron, even to the tree by 
which I stood; and it also led by the 
head of the fountain, unto a large 
and spacious field, as if it had been 
a b world.

21 And  I  saw  numberless  con-
courses of people, many of whom 
were  a pressing forward, that they 
might obtain the  b path which led 
unto the tree by which I stood.

22 And it came to pass that they 
did come forth, and commence in 
the path which led to the tree.

23 And it came to pass that there 
arose a a mist of darkness; yea, even 
an exceedingly great mist of dark-
ness, insomuch that they who had 
commenced in the path did lose their

way,  that  they  wandered  off  and 
were b lost.

24 And it came to pass that I be-
held others pressing forward, and 
they came forth and caught hold of 
the end of the rod of iron; and they 
did press forward through the mist 
of darkness, a clinging to the rod of 
iron, even until they did come forth 
and partake of the b fruit of the tree.
25 And after they had partaken of 
the fruit of the tree they did cast 
their  eyes  about  as  if  they  were 
a ashamed.

26 And I also cast my eyes round 
about,  and  beheld,  on  the  a other 
side of the river of water, a great 
and b spacious building; and it stood 
as  it  were  in  the  c air,  high  above 
the earth.

27 And it was filled with people, 
both old and young, both male and 
female; and their manner of dress 
was  exceedingly  fine;  and  they 
were in the  a attitude of  b mocking 
and pointing their fingers towards 
those  who  had  come  at  and  were 
partaking of the fruit.

28 And after they had  a tasted of 
the fruit they were  b ashamed, be-
cause of those that were  c scoffing 
at  them;  and  they  d fell  away  into 
forbidden paths and were lost.

29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak

a all the words of my father.
