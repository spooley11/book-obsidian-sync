ALMA 32  : 13–27

13 And now, because ye are com-
pelled to be humble blessed are ye; 
for a man sometimes, if he is com-
pelled to be humble, seeketh a repen-
tance; and now surely, whosoever 
repenteth shall find mercy; and he 
that findeth mercy and b endureth 
to the end the same shall be saved.
14 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
that  because  ye  were  compelled 
to be a humble ye were blessed, do 
ye not suppose that they are more 
blessed  who  truly  humble  them-
selves because of the word?

15 Yea,  he  that  truly  humbleth 
himself, and repenteth of his sins, 
and endureth to the end, the same 
shall be blessed—yea, much more 
blessed  than  they  who  are  com-
pelled  to  be  humble  because  of 
their exceeding poverty.

16 Therefore, blessed are they who 
a humble themselves without being 
b compelled to be humble; or rather, 
in other words, blessed is he that 
believeth in the word of God, and is 
baptized without c stubbornness of 
heart, yea, without being brought to 
know the word, or even compelled 
to know, before they will believe.

17 Yea, there are many who do say: 
If  thou  wilt  show  unto  us  a  a sign 
from heaven, then we shall know 
of a surety; then we shall believe.

18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, 
I  say  unto  you,  Nay;  for  if  a  man 
knoweth a thing he hath no cause 
to a believe, for he knoweth it.

19 And  now,  how  much  a more 
b cursed  is  he  that  c knoweth  the 
d will of God and doeth it not, than 
he that only believeth, or only hath 
cause  to  believe,  and  falleth  into 
e transgression?

20 Now of this thing ye must judge.
