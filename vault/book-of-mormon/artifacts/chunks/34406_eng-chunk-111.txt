CHAPTER 1
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—
His seed will be scattered and smitten if 
they reject the Holy One of Israel—He 
exhorts  his  sons  to  put  on  the  armor 
of righteousness. About 588–570 b.c.

AND  now  it  came  to  pass  that

after  I,  Nephi,  had  made  an  
   end of teaching my brethren, 
our a father, Lehi, also spake many 
things  unto  them,  and  rehearsed 
unto  them,  how  great  things  the 
Lord had done for them in bringing 
them out of the land of Jerusalem.
2 And  he  spake  unto  them  con-
cerning their a rebellions upon the 
waters, and the mercies of God in

sparing their lives, that they were 
not swallowed up in the sea.

3 And he also spake unto them con-
cerning the land of promise, which 
they had obtained—how a merciful 
the Lord had been in b warning us 
that we should flee out of the land 
of Jerusalem.

4 For, behold, said he, I have a seen 
a  b vision,  in  which  I  know  that  
c Jerusalem is d destroyed; and had we 
remained in Jerusalem we should 
also have e perished.

5 But,  said  he,  notwithstanding 
our  afflictions,  we  have  obtained 
a a land of promise, a land which is 
b choice above all other lands; a land  
which the Lord God hath c covenanted
