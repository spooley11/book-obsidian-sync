ALMA 5  : 16–26

redemption  of  him  who  a created 
you? Do you look forward with an 
eye of faith, and view this mortal 
body  raised  in  immortality,  and 
this  corruption  b raised  in  incor-
ruption,  to  stand  before  God  to 
be c judged according to the deeds 
which have been done in the mortal  
body ?

16 I say unto you, can you imagine 
to yourselves that ye hear the voice 
of the Lord, saying unto you, in that 
day: Come unto me ye a blessed, for 
behold, your works have been the 
works  of  righteousness  upon  the 
face of the earth?

17 Or do ye a imagine to yourselves 
that  ye  can  lie  unto  the  Lord  in 
that day, and b say—Lord, our works 
have  been  righteous  works  upon 
the face of the earth—and that he 
will save you?

18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine 
yourselves brought before the tri-
bunal of God with your souls filled 
with  guilt  and  remorse,  having  a 
remembrance of all your guilt, yea, 
a perfect a remembrance of all your 
wickedness,  yea,  a  remembrance 
that  ye  have  set  at  defiance  the 
commandments of God?

19 I say unto you, can ye look up  
to God at that day with a pure heart  
and  clean  hands?  I  say  unto  you, 
can you look up, having the a image  
of God engraven upon your counte-
nances?

20 I say unto you, can ye think of 
being saved when you have yielded 
yourselves to become  a subjects to 
the devil?

21 I say unto you, ye will know at 
that day that ye cannot be a saved;

for  there  can  no  man  be  saved 
except  his  b garments  are  washed 
white;  yea,  his  garments  must  be 
c purified  until  they  are  cleansed 
from  all  stain,  through  the  blood 
of  him  of  whom  it  has  been  spo-
ken  by  our  fathers,  who  should 
come  to  redeem  his  people  from  
their sins.
