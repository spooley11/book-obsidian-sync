15 And  those  who  did  belong  to 
the church were a faithful; yea, all 
those  who  were  true  believers  in 
Christ b took upon them, gladly, the 
name  of  Christ,  or  c Christians  as 
they were called, because of their 
belief in Christ who should come.
16 And  therefore,  at  this  time,  
Moroni prayed that the cause of the

Christians, and the a freedom of the 
land might be favored.

17 And it came to pass that when 
he had poured out his soul to God, 
he named all the land which was 
a south of the land b Desolation, yea, 
and in fine, all the land, both on the 
c north and on the south—A chosen 
land, and the land of d liberty.

18 And he said: Surely God shall 
not a suffer that we, who are despised 
because we take upon us the name 
of Christ, shall be trodden down and 
destroyed, until we bring it upon us 
by our own b transgressions.

19 And  when  Moroni  had  said 
these words, he went forth among 
the people, waving the a rent part of 
his garment in the air, that all might 
see the writing which he had writ-
ten upon the rent part, and crying 
with a loud voice, saying:

20 Behold, whosoever will main-
tain  this  title  upon  the  land,  let 
them  come  forth  in  the  strength 
of the Lord, and a enter into a cov-
enant that they will b maintain their 
rights, and their religion, that the 
Lord God may bless them.

21 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni had proclaimed these words, 
behold,  the people  came  running 
a together with their armor girded 
about their loins, b rending their gar-
ments in token, or as a  c covenant, 
that  they  would  not  forsake  the 
Lord their God; or, in other words, 
if they should transgress the com-
mandments  of  God,  or  fall  into 
transgression, and be d ashamed to 
take upon them the name of Christ, 
the Lord should rend them even as 
they had rent their garments.
