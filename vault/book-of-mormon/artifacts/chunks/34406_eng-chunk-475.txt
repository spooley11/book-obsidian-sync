4 And they had been teaching the 
word of God for the space of fourteen  
years among the Lamanites, having 
had much a success in bringing many 
to the b knowledge of the truth; yea, 
by the power of their words many 
were brought before the altar of God,  
to  call  on  his  name  and  c confess 
their sins before him.

which attended them in their jour-
neyings, for they had many afflic-
tions; they did suffer much, both in 
body and in mind, such as hunger, 
thirst and fatigue, and also much 
a labor in the spirit.

6 Now these were their journey-
ings: Having  a taken leave of their 
father, Mosiah, in the b first year of 
the judges; having c refused the king-

and their slings; and this they did

themselves while in the wilderness.

the wilderness with their numbers 
which they had a selected, to go up 
to the land of Nephi, to preach the 
word of God unto the Lamanites.
