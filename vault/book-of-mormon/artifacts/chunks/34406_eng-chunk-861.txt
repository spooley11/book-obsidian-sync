16 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did  again  minister  upon  the  face 
of the earth; nevertheless they did 
not  minister  of  the  things  which 
they had heard and seen, because 
of  the  commandment  which  was 
given them in heaven.

17 And  now,  whether  they  were 
mortal or immortal, from the day 
of their transfiguration, I know not;
18 But this much I know, accord-
ing to the record which hath been 
given—they did go forth upon the 
face of the land, and did minister 
unto all the people, uniting as many 
to the church as would believe in 
their  preaching;  baptizing  them, 
and as many as were baptized did 
receive the Holy Ghost.

19 And they were cast into prison 
by them who did not belong to the 
church. And the a prisons could not 
hold  them,  for  they  were  rent  in 
twain.

20 And they were cast down into 
the  earth;  but  they  did  smite  the 
earth with the word of God, inso-
much that by his a power they were 
delivered out of the depths of the 
earth; and therefore they could not 
dig pits sufficient to hold them.

21 And thrice they were cast into

a a furnace and received no harm.

22 And twice were they cast into 
a  a den of wild beasts; and behold 
they did play with the beasts as a 
child with a suckling lamb, and re-
ceived no harm.

23 And it came to pass that thus 
they  did  go  forth  among  all  the 
people  of  Nephi,  and  did  preach 
the a gospel of Christ unto all peo-
ple upon the face of the land; and

they were converted unto the Lord, 
and were united unto the church of 
Christ, and thus the people of b that 
generation were blessed, according 
to the word of Jesus.

24 And now I, a Mormon, make an 
end of speaking concerning these 
things for a time.

25 Behold, I was about to write the 
a names of those who were never to 
taste of death, but the Lord forbade; 
therefore I write them not, for they 
are hid from the world.

26 But behold, a I have seen them, 
and they have ministered unto me.
27 And behold they will be a among 
the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall 
know them not.
