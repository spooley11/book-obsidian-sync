4 Therefore,  there  shall  be  one 
a day  and  a  night  and  a  day,  as  if 
it were one day and there were no 
night;  and  this  shall  be  unto  you 
for a sign; for ye shall know of the 
rising of the sun and also of its set-
ting; therefore they shall know of a 
surety that there shall be two days 
and a night; nevertheless the night 
shall not be darkened; and it shall 
be the night before he is b born.

5 And  behold,  there  shall  a  new 
a star arise, such an one as ye never 
have beheld; and this also shall be 
a sign unto you.

6 And behold this is not all, there 
shall be many a signs and wonders 
in heaven.

7 And it shall come to pass that ye  
shall all be amazed, and wonder, inso-
much that ye shall a fall to the earth.
8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
whosoever shall a believe on the Son  
of God, the same shall have ever-
lasting life.

9 And behold, thus hath the Lord 
commanded me, by his angel, that 
I  should  come  and  tell  this  thing 
unto you; yea, he hath commanded 
that I should prophesy these things 
unto  you;  yea,  he  hath  said  unto 
me:  Cry  unto  this  people,  repent 
and prepare the way of the Lord.

10 And  now,  because  I  am  a  La-
manite, and have spoken unto you 
the  words  which  the  Lord  hath 
commanded me, and because it was 
hard against you, ye are angry with 
me and do seek to destroy me, and 
have a cast me out from among you.
11 And ye shall  a hear my words, 
for, for this intent have I come up 
upon the walls of this city, that ye 
might hear and know of the judg-
ments of God which do await you 
because of your iniquities, and also 
that ye might know the conditions 
of repentance;

12 And also that ye might know of 
the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of God, the a Father of heaven and of 
earth, the Creator of all things from 
the beginning; and that ye might 
know  of  the  signs  of  his  coming, 
to the intent that ye might believe 
on his name.
