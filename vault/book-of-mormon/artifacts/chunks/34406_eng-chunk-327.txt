15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
planted vineyards round about in 
the land; and he built wine-presses, 
and made a wine in abundance; and 
therefore he became a wine-bibber, 
and also his people.

16 And it came to pass that the La-
manites began to come in upon his 
people, upon small numbers, and to 
slay them in their fields, and while 
they were tending their flocks.

MOSIAH 11  : 18–29

off; but he did not send a sufficient 
number, and the Lamanites came 
upon  them  and  killed  them,  and 
drove many of their flocks out of 
the land; thus the Lamanites began 
to  destroy  them,  and  to  exercise 
their hatred upon them.

18 And it came to pass that king 
Noah sent his armies against them, 
and they were driven back, or they 
drove them back for a time; there-
fore,  they  returned  rejoicing  in 
their spoil.

19 And now, because of this great 
victory they were lifted up in the 
pride of their hearts; they did a boast 
in their own strength, saying that 
their fifty could stand against thou-
sands  of  the  Lamanites;  and  thus 
they  did  boast,  and  did  delight 
in blood, and the shedding of the 
blood  of  their  brethren,  and  this 
because of the wickedness of their 
king and priests.
