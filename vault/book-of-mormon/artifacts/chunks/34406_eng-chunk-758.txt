Lamanites,  and  began  to  depend 
upon their a own strength and upon 
their own wisdom, saying:

16 Some  things  they  may  have 
guessed right, among so many; but 
behold, we know that all these great 
and marvelous works cannot come 
to pass, of which has been spoken.
17 And they began to reason and to 
contend among themselves, saying:
18 That it is a not reasonable that 
such a being as a Christ shall come; 
if so, and he be the Son of God, the 
Father of heaven and of earth, as it 
has been spoken, why will he not 
show himself unto us as well as unto 
them who shall be at Jerusalem?

19 Yea, why will he not show him-
self  in  this  land  as  well  as  in  the 
land of Jerusalem?

20 But behold, we know that this is 
a wicked a tradition, which has been 
handed down unto us by our fathers,  
to cause us that we should believe 
in some great and marvelous thing 
which should come to pass, but not 
among us, but in a land which is 
far distant, a land which we know 
not; therefore they can keep us in 
ignorance, for we cannot b witness 
with our own eyes that they are true.
21 And they will, by the cunning 
and the mysterious arts of the evil

one, work some great mystery which 
we cannot understand, which will 
keep  us  down  to  be  servants  to 
their words, and also servants unto 
them, for we depend upon them to 
teach  us  the  word;  and  thus  will 
they keep us in ignorance if we will 
yield ourselves unto them, all the 
days of our lives.
