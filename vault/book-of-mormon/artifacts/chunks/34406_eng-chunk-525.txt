23 And  behold,  we  will  set  our 
armies  between  the  land  Jershon 
and the land Nephi, that we may 
a protect our brethren in the land 
Jershon;  and  this  we  do  for  our 
brethren,  on  account  of  their 
fear to take up arms against their 
brethren lest they should commit 
sin; and this their great fear came 
because  of  their  sore  repentance 
which they had, on account of their 
many  murders  and  their  awful  
wickedness.

24 And now behold, this will we

do  unto  our  brethren,  that  they 
may inherit the land Jershon; and 
we will guard them from their en-
emies with our armies, on condition 
that they will give us a a portion of 
their substance to assist us that we 
may maintain our armies.

25 Now, it came to pass that when 
Ammon had heard this, he returned 
to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
and also Alma with him, into the 
wilderness, where they had pitched 
their tents, and made known unto 
them  all  these  things.  And  Alma 
also related unto them his a conver-
sion, with Ammon and Aaron, and 
his brethren.

26 And it came to pass that it did 
cause great joy among them. And 
they  went  down  into  the  land  of 
Jershon,  and  took  possession  of  
the land of Jershon; and they were 
called by the Nephites the a people 
of  Ammon;  therefore  they  were 
distinguished  by  that  name  ever  
after.

27 And they were among the peo-
ple  of  Nephi,  and  also  numbered 
among the people who were of the 
church of God. And they were also 
distinguished for their a zeal towards 
God, and also towards men; for they 
were perfectly b honest and upright 
in all things; and they were  c firm 
in  the  faith  of  Christ,  even  unto  
the end.

28 And they did look upon shed-
ding  the  blood  of  their  brethren 
with the greatest abhorrence; and 
they never could be prevailed upon 
to take up arms against their breth-
ren; and they never did look upon 
death with any degree of terror, for 
their hope and views of Christ and 
the  resurrection;  therefore,  death 
was swallowed up to them by the 
victory of Christ over it.

29 Therefore,  they  would  suffer
