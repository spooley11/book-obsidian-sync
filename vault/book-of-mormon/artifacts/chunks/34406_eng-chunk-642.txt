31 And it came to pass that before 
the Lamanites had retreated far they 
were surrounded by the Nephites,  
by the men of Moroni on one hand, 
and the men of Lehi on the other, 
all of whom were fresh and full of 
strength;  but  the  Lamanites  were 
wearied because of their long march.
32 And  Moroni  commanded  his 
men  that  they  should  fall  upon 
them until they had given up their 
weapons of war.

33 And it came to pass that Jacob,  
being  their  leader,  being  also  a 
a Zoramite,  and  having  an  uncon-
querable spirit, he led the Laman-
ites forth to battle with exceeding 
fury against Moroni.

34 Moroni being in their course of 
march, therefore Jacob was deter-
mined to slay them and cut his way 
through to the city of Mulek. But 
behold, Moroni and his men were 
more powerful; therefore they did 
not give way before the Lamanites.
35 And it came to pass that they 
fought on both hands with exceed-
ing fury; and there were many slain 
on both sides; yea, and Moroni was 
wounded and Jacob was killed.

36 And  Lehi  pressed  upon  their 
rear with such fury with his strong 
men, that the Lamanites in the rear 
delivered up their weapons of war; 
and the remainder of them, being 
much confused, knew not whither 
to go or to strike.

37 Now Moroni seeing their con-
fusion, he said unto them: If ye will

bring  forth  your  weapons  of  war 
and  deliver  them  up,  behold  we 
will forbear shedding your blood.
38 And it came to pass that when 
the  Lamanites  had  heard  these 
words, their chief captains, all those 
who were not slain, came forth and 
threw down their weapons of war 
a at the feet of Moroni, and also com-
manded their men that they should 
do the same.

39 But  behold,  there  were  many 
that  would  not;  and  those  who 
would not deliver up their swords 
were  taken  and  bound,  and  their 
weapons  of  war  were  taken  from 
them, and they were compelled to 
march  with  their  brethren  forth 
into the land Bountiful.
