8 And when they had ministered 
those same words which Jesus had 
spoken—nothing varying from the 
words which Jesus had spoken—be-
hold, they knelt again and prayed 
to the Father in the name of Jesus.
9 And they did pray for that which 
they most desired; and they desired 
that the a Holy Ghost should be given 
unto them.

10 And when they had thus prayed 
they  went  down  unto  the  water’s 
edge, and the multitude followed 
them.

11 And it came to pass that Nephi 
went down a into the water and was 
b baptized.

12 And  he  came  up  out  of  the

water  and  began  to  baptize.  And 
he baptized all those whom Jesus

commanded them that they should 
kneel down again upon the earth, 
and also that his disciples should 
kneel down upon the earth.

17 And it came to pass that when 
they had all knelt down upon the 
earth, he commanded his disciples 
that they should pray.

18 And  behold,  they  began  to  
pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, 
calling  him  their  Lord  and  their 
God.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus 
departed out of the midst of them, 
and  went  a  little  way  off  from

earth, and he said:
