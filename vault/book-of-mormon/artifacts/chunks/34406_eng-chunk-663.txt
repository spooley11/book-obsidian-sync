25 And it came to pass that there 
were two hundred, out of my two 
thousand and sixty, who had fainted 
because of the loss of blood; never-
theless, according to the goodness of 
God, and to our great astonishment, 
and also the joy of our whole army, 
there was a not one soul of them who 
did  perish;  yea,  and  neither  was 
there  one  soul  among  them  who 
had not received many wounds.

26 And  now,  their  a preservation 
was astonishing to our whole army, 
yea,  that  they  should  be  spared 
while there was a thousand of our 
brethren who were slain. And we 
do justly ascribe it to the miracu-
lous b power of God, because of their 
exceeding c faith in that which they 
had  been  taught  to  believe—that 
there was a just God, and whoso-
ever did not doubt, that they should 
be  preserved  by  his  marvelous  
power.

27 Now this was the a faith of these 
of  whom  I  have  spoken;  they  are 
young, and their minds are b firm, 
and they do put their trust in God 
continually.

28 And now it came to pass that 
after we had thus taken care of our 
wounded men, and had buried our 
dead and also the dead of the La-
manites, who were many, behold, 
we  did  inquire  of  Gid  concern-
ing the a prisoners whom they had 
started to go down to the land of 
Zarahemla with.

29 Now Gid was the chief captain 
over the band who was appointed 
to guard them down to the land.

30 And now, these are the words 
which  Gid  said  unto  me:  Behold, 
we did start to go down to the land 
of  Zarahemla  with  our  prisoners. 
And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  did 
meet the spies of our armies, who
