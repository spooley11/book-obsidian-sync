22 And now I ask of you, my breth-
ren, how will any of you feel, if ye 
shall stand before the bar of God, 
having your garments stained with 
a blood and all manner of  b filthiness? 
Behold, what will these things tes-
tify against you?

23 Behold  will  they  not  a testify  
that ye are murderers, yea, and also 
that ye are b guilty of all manner of 
wickedness?

24 Behold,  my  brethren,  do  ye 
suppose that such an one can have 
a  place  to  sit  down  in  the  king-
dom of God, with a Abraham, with 
Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all 
the holy prophets, whose garments 
are cleansed and are spotless, pure 
and white?

25 I say unto you, Nay; except ye 
make  our  Creator  a  liar  from  the 
beginning, or suppose that he is a 
liar from the beginning, ye cannot 
suppose that such can have place 
in  the  kingdom  of  heaven;  but 
they shall be cast out for they are 
the  a children  of  the  kingdom  of  
the devil.

26 And now behold, I say unto you, 
my brethren, if ye have experienced 
a a change of heart, and if ye have 
felt  to  sing  the  b song  of  redeem-
ing love, I would ask,  c can ye feel  
so now?
