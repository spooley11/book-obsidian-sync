is  my  doctrine,  that  such  things 
a should be done away.

31 Behold,  verily,  verily,  I  say 
unto  you,  I  will  declare  unto  you 
my a doctrine.

32 And this is my  a doctrine, and 
it is the doctrine which the Father 
hath  given  unto  me;  and  I  bear 
b record of the Father, and the Father 
beareth record of me, and the c Holy 
Ghost beareth record of the Father 
and me; and I bear record that the 
Father commandeth all men, every-
where, to repent and believe in me.
33 And  whoso  believeth  in  me, 
and is a baptized, the same shall be 
b saved; and they are they who shall 
c inherit the kingdom of God.

34 And  whoso  believeth  not  in 
me, and is not  a baptized, shall be 
damned.

35 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that this is my doctrine, and I bear 
record  of  it  from  the  Father;  and 
whoso  a believeth  in  me  believeth  
in  the  Father  also;  and  unto  him 
will the Father bear record of me, 
for he will visit him b with fire and 
with the c Holy Ghost.

36 And thus will the Father bear 
record of me, and the a Holy Ghost 
will  bear  record  unto  him  of  the 
Father and me; for the Father, and 
I, and the Holy Ghost are b one.

37 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  ye 
must repent, and a become as a b little  
child, and be baptized in my name, 
or ye can in nowise receive these 
things.

38 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  ye 
must repent, and be baptized in my

name, and become as a little a child, 
or  ye  can  in  nowise  inherit  the  
kingdom of God.
