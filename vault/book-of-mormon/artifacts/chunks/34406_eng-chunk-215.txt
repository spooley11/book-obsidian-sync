2 NEPHI 28  : 25–29  : 3

25 Wo  be  unto  him  that  crieth:

All is well!

26 Yea, wo be unto him that a heark-
eneth unto the precepts of men, and 
denieth the power of God, and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost!

27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: 
We  have  received,  and  we  a need 
no more!

31 Cursed  is  he  that  putteth  his 
a trust in man, or maketh flesh his 
arm, or shall hearken unto the b pre-
cepts  of  men,  save  their  precepts 
shall be given by the power of the 
Holy Ghost.

32 a Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith 
the Lord God of Hosts! For notwith-
