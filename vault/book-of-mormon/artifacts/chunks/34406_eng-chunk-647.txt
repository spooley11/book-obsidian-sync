6 Behold, I would tell you some-
what  concerning  the  a justice  of 
God, and the sword of his almighty 
wrath, which doth hang over you 
except ye repent and withdraw your 
armies into your own lands, or the 
land of your possessions, which is 
the land of Nephi.

7 Yea, I would tell you these things 
if  ye  were  capable  of  hearkening 
unto  them;  yea,  I  would  tell  you 
concerning  that  awful  a hell  that 
awaits to receive such b murderers 
as thou and thy brother have been, 
except  ye  repent  and  withdraw 
your  murderous  purposes,  and 
return  with  your  armies  to  your  
own lands.

8 But as ye have once rejected these 
things, and have fought against the 
people of the Lord, even so I may 
expect you will do it again.

9 And now behold, we are prepared 
to receive you; yea, and except you 
withdraw your purposes, behold, ye 
will pull down the  a wrath of that 
God whom you have rejected upon 
you, even to your utter destruction.
10 But,  as  the  Lord  liveth,  our 
armies shall come upon you except 
ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be 
visited with a death, for we will re-
tain our cities and our lands; yea,

and we will maintain our religion 
and the cause of our God.

11 But  behold,  it  supposeth  me 
that I talk to you concerning these 
things in vain; or it supposeth me 
that thou art a a child of hell; there-
fore I will close my epistle by tell-
ing  you  that  I  will  not  exchange 
prisoners, save it be on conditions 
that ye will deliver up a man and 
his wife and his children, for one 
prisoner; if this be the case that ye 
will do it, I will exchange.
