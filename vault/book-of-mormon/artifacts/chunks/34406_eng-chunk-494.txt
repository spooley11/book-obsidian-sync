21 Now  when  the  king  saw  that 
Ammon could slay him, he began 
to plead with Ammon that he would 
spare his life.

22 But Ammon raised his sword, 
and said unto him: Behold, I will 
smite thee except thou wilt grant 
unto me that my brethren may be 
a cast out of prison.

23 Now the king, fearing he should 
lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare 
me I will grant unto thee whatso-
ever thou wilt ask, even to half of 
the kingdom.

24 Now when Ammon saw that he 
had wrought upon the old king ac-
cording to his desire, he said unto 
him:  If  thou  wilt  grant  that  my 
brethren may be cast out of prison, 
and also that Lamoni may retain his 
kingdom,  and  that  ye  be  not  dis-
pleased with him, but grant that he 
may do according to his own desires 
in a whatsoever thing he thinketh,

then will I spare thee; otherwise I 
will smite thee to the earth.

25 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these words, the king began to re-
joice because of his life.

26 And when he saw that Ammon 
had no desire to destroy him, and 
when  he  also  saw  the  great  a love 
he had for his son Lamoni, he was 
astonished  exceedingly,  and  said: 
Because  this  is  all  that  thou  hast 
desired,  that  I  would  b release  thy 
brethren,  and  suffer  that  my  son 
Lamoni should retain his kingdom, 
behold, I will grant unto you that 
my  son  may  retain  his  kingdom 
from this time and forever; and I 
will govern him no more—

27 And I will also grant unto thee 
that thy brethren may be cast out 
of prison, and thou and thy breth-
ren may come unto me, in my king-
dom;  for  I  shall  greatly  desire  to 
see thee. For the king was greatly 
astonished  at  the  words  which  he 
had spoken, and also at the words 
which had been spoken by his son 
Lamoni, therefore he was a desirous to  
learn them.
