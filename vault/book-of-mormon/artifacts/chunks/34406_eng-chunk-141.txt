Jacob  continues  reading  from  Isaiah:  
Isaiah  speaks  messianically—The  
Messiah  will  have  the  tongue  of  the 
learned—He will give His back to the 
smiters—He will not be confounded—
Compare Isaiah 50. About 559–545 b.c.
a Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have 
I put thee away, or have I cast thee 
off forever? For thus saith the Lord: 
Where is the b bill of your mother’s 
c divorcement? To whom have I put 
thee away, or to which of my d credi-
tors have I e sold you? Yea, to whom 
have I sold you? Behold, for your 
iniquities have ye sold yourselves, 
and for your transgressions is your 
mother put away.

2 Wherefore,  when  I  came,  there 
was  no  man;  when  I  a called,  yea, 
there was none to answer. O house of  
Israel, is my hand shortened at all 
that it cannot redeem, or have I no 
power to deliver? Behold, at my re-
buke I b dry up the c sea, I make their 
d rivers a wilderness and their e fish 
to stink because the waters are dried 
up, and they die because of thirst.
3 I clothe the heavens with a black-
ness,  and  I  make  b sackcloth  their 
covering.

4 The Lord God hath given me the 
a tongue of the learned, that I should 
know how to speak a word in season 
unto thee, O house of Israel. When
