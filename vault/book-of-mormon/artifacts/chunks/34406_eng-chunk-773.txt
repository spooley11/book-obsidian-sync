7 And it came to pass that they did 
come up to battle; and it was in the 
sixth month; and behold, great and 
terrible was the day that they did 
come up to battle; and they were 
girded about after the manner of 
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin 
about  their  loins,  and  they  were 
dyed in blood, and their heads were 
shorn,  and  they  had  head-plates 
upon them; and great and terrible 
was the appearance of the armies of 
Giddianhi, because of their armor,  
and  because  of  their  being  dyed 
in blood.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Nephites, when they 
saw  the  appearance  of  the  army 
of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the 
earth, and did lift their cries to the 
Lord their God, that he would spare 
them and deliver them out of the 
hands of their enemies.

9 And it came to pass that when 
the  armies  of  Giddianhi  saw  this 
they  began  to  shout  with  a  loud 
voice, because of their joy, for they 
had supposed that the Nephites had 
fallen with fear because of the ter-
ror of their armies.

10 But  in  this  thing  they  were 
disappointed, for the Nephites did 
not  a fear  them;  but  they  did  fear 
their God and did supplicate him 
for b protection; therefore, when the 
armies of Giddianhi did rush upon 
them they were prepared to meet 
them;  yea,  in  the  strength  of  the 
Lord they did receive them.

11 And the battle commenced in 
this the sixth month; and great and 
terrible was the battle thereof, yea, 
great and terrible was the a slaughter 
thereof, insomuch that there never 
was  known  so  great  a  slaughter 
among all the people of Lehi since 
he left Jerusalem.

12 And  notwithstanding  the 
a threatenings and the oaths which 
Giddianhi  had  made,  behold,  the 
Nephites did beat them, insomuch 
that they did fall back from before 
them.

13 And it came to pass that a Gid-
giddoni commanded that his armies 
should  pursue  them  as  far  as  the 
borders of the wilderness, and that 
they  should  not  spare  any  that 
should fall into their hands by the 
way; and thus they did pursue them 
and did slay them, to the borders 
of the wilderness, even until they 
had fulfilled the commandment of 
Gidgiddoni.
