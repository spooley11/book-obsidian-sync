19 Now it came to pass that after 
Alma and his brethren and his sons 
had heard these prayers, they were 
astonished beyond all measure.

20 For  behold,  every  man  did 
go  forth  and  offer  up  these  same 
a prayers.

21 Now  the  place  was  called  by 
them Rameumptom, which, being 
interpreted, is the holy stand.

22 Now, from this stand they did 
offer up, every man, the selfsame 
prayer  unto  God,  thanking  their 
God that they were chosen of him, 
and that he did not lead them away 
after the tradition of their brethren, 
and that their hearts were not stolen 
away to believe in things to come, 
which they knew nothing about.

23 Now, after the people had all 
offered up thanks after this man-
ner, they returned to their homes, 
a never speaking of their God again 
until they had assembled themselves 
together again to the holy stand, to 
offer up thanks after their manner.
24 Now  when  Alma  saw  this  his 
heart was a grieved; for he saw that 
they were a wicked and a perverse 
people; yea, he saw that their hearts 
were set upon gold, and upon silver, 
and upon all manner of fine goods.

ALMA 31  : 25–38

25 Yea, and he also saw that their 
hearts  were  a lifted  up  unto  great 
boasting, in their pride.

26 And  he  lifted  up  his  voice  to 
heaven, and a cried, saying: O, how 
long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that 
thy servants shall dwell here below 
in the flesh, to behold such gross 
wickedness among the children of 
men?

27 Behold, O God, they a cry unto 
thee, and yet their hearts are swal-
lowed up in their pride. Behold, O 
God, they cry unto thee with their 
mouths, while they are b puffed up, 
even  to  greatness,  with  the  vain 
things of the c world.
