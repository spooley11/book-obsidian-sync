16 Then shall ye, who are a a rem-
nant of the house of Jacob, go forth 
among them; and ye shall be in the 
midst of them who shall be many; 
and ye shall be among them as a lion 
among the beasts of the forest, and 
as a young b lion among the flocks 
of sheep, who, if he goeth through 
both c treadeth down and teareth in 
pieces, and none can deliver.

17 Thy  hand  shall  be  lifted  up 
upon thine adversaries, and all thine 
enemies shall be cut off.

18 And I will  a gather my people 
together  as  a  man  gathereth  his 
sheaves into the floor.

19 For I will make my a people with 
whom the Father hath covenanted, 
yea, I will make thy b horn iron, and 
I  will  make  thy  hoofs  brass.  And 
thou  shalt  c beat  in  pieces  many  
people; and I will consecrate their 
gain unto the Lord, and their sub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole 
earth.  And  behold,  I  am  he  who 
doeth it.

20 And it shall come to pass, saith 
the Father, that the  a sword of my 
justice shall hang over them at that 
day; and except they repent it shall 
fall  upon  them,  saith  the  Father, 
yea,  even  upon  all  the  nations  of 
the Gentiles.

21 And it shall come to pass that I 
will establish my a people, O house 
of Israel.

22 And behold, this  a people will

I  establish  in  this  land,  unto  the 
fulfilling of the b covenant which I 
made with your father Jacob; and 
it shall be a c New Jerusalem. And 
the  d powers of heaven shall be in 
the midst of this people; yea, even 
e I will be in the midst of you.

23 Behold, I am he of whom Mo-
ses spake, saying: a A prophet shall  
the  Lord  your  God  raise  up  unto 
you  of  your  brethren,  like  unto 
me; him shall ye hear in all things 
whatsoever he shall say unto you. 
And it shall come to pass that every 
soul who will not hear that prophet 
shall  be  cut  off  from  among  the  
people.
