journeyed  many  days  in  the  wil-
derness, and they fasted much and 
a prayed much that the Lord would 
grant  unto  them  a  portion  of  his 
Spirit to go with them, and abide 
with them, that they might be an 
b instrument in the hands of God to 
bring, if it were possible, their breth-
ren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge 
of the truth, to the knowledge of the  
baseness of the c traditions of their 
fathers, which were not correct.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did a visit them with his b Spirit, 
and said unto them: Be c comforted. 
And they were comforted.

11 And the Lord said unto them 
also:  Go  forth  among  the  Laman-
ites,  thy  brethren,  and  establish 
my word; yet ye shall be a patient in 
long-suffering and afflictions, that 
ye may show forth good b examples 
unto them in me, and I will make 
an instrument of thee in my hands 
unto the salvation of many souls.

12 And it came to pass that the hearts 
of the sons of Mosiah, and also those  
who were with them, took courage 
to  go  forth  unto  the  Lamanites  to 
declare unto them the word of God.
13 And it came to pass when they 
had arrived in the borders of the 
land  of  the  Lamanites,  that  they 
a separated themselves and departed 
one  from  another,  trusting  in  the 
Lord that they should meet again 
at  the  close  of  their  b harvest;  for 
they  supposed  that  great  was  the 
work which they had undertaken.
14 And  assuredly  it  was  great, 
for they had undertaken to preach 
the word of God to a  a wild and a 
hardened and a ferocious people; 
a people who delighted in murder-
ing the Nephites, and robbing and 
plundering them; and their hearts 
were set upon riches, or upon gold

and silver, and precious stones; yet 
they sought to obtain these things 
by murdering and plundering, that 
they might not labor for them with 
their own hands.

15 Thus they were a very indolent 
people, many of whom did worship 
idols,  and  the  a curse  of  God  had 
fallen  upon  them  because  of  the 
b traditions of their fathers; notwith-
standing the promises of the Lord 
were  extended  unto  them  on  the 
conditions of repentance.
