large,  and  they  are  of  b brass  and 
of copper, and are perfectly sound.
11 And again, they have brought 
swords, the hilts thereof have per-
ished, and the blades thereof were 
cankered with rust; and there is no 
one in the land that is able to inter-
pret the language or the engravings 
that are on the plates. Therefore I 
said unto thee: Canst thou translate?
12 And  I  say  unto  thee  again: 
Knowest thou of any one that can 
translate?  For  I  am  desirous  that 
these records should be translated 
into  our  language;  for,  perhaps, 
they will give us a knowledge of a 
remnant  of  the  people  who  have 
been destroyed, from whence these 
records came; or, perhaps, they will 
give  us  a  knowledge  of  this  very 
people  who  have  been  destroyed; 
and I am desirous to know the cause 
of their destruction.

13 Now Ammon said unto him: I 
can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a 
man that can a translate the records; 
for he has wherewith that he can 
look, and translate all records that 
are of ancient date; and it is a gift 
from God. And the things are called 
b interpreters, and no man can look 
in them except he be commanded, 
lest he should look for that he ought 
not and he should perish. And who-
soever  is  commanded  to  look  in 
them, the same is called c seer.

14 And behold, the king of the peo-
ple who are in the land of Zarahemla 
is the man that is commanded to 
do these things, and who has this 
high gift from God.

15 And the king said that a a seer

is greater than a prophet.

16 And Ammon said that a seer is 
a revelator and a prophet also; and 
a gift which is greater can no man
