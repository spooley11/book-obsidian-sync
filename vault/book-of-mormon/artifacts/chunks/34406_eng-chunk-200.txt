4 Wherefore,  all  those  who  are 
proud,  and  that  do  wickedly,  the 
day that cometh shall a burn them 
up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they 
shall be as stubble.

5 And they that kill the a prophets, 
and  the  saints,  the  depths  of  the 
earth shall b swallow them up, saith 
the Lord of Hosts; and c mountains 
shall cover them, and whirlwinds 
shall carry them away, and build-
ings shall fall upon them and crush 
them to pieces and grind them to 
powder.

6 And they shall be visited with 
thunderings,  and  lightnings,  and 
earthquakes, and all manner of de-
structions, for the a fire of the anger 
of the Lord shall be kindled against 
them, and they shall be as stubble, 
and the day that cometh shall con-
sume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
7 a O  the  pain,  and  the  anguish  
of my soul for the loss of the slain of  
my people! For I, Nephi, have seen 
it, and it well nigh consumeth me 
before  the  presence  of  the  Lord; 
but I must cry unto my God: Thy 
ways are b just.

8 But  behold,  the  righteous  that 
hearken unto the words of the proph-
ets, and destroy them not, but look  
forward unto Christ with a steadfast-

ness for the signs which are given, 
notwithstanding all b persecution—
behold, they are they which shall 
c not perish.

9 But  the  Son  of  Righteousness  
shall  a appear  unto  them;  and  he 
shall b heal them, and they shall have 
c peace with him, until d three genera-
tions  shall  have  passed  away,  and 
many of the e fourth generation shall 
have passed away in righteousness.
10 And  when  these  things  have 
passed  away  a  speedy  a destruc-
tion  cometh  unto  my  people;  for, 
notwithstanding  the  pains  of  my 
soul,  I  have  seen  it;  wherefore,  I 
know that it shall come to pass; and 
they sell themselves for naught; for, 
for the reward of their pride and 
their  b foolishness  they  shall  reap 
destruction; for because they yield 
unto the devil and c choose works of 
d darkness rather than light, there-
fore they must go down to e hell.

11 For the Spirit of the Lord will 
not always  a strive with man. And 
when the Spirit  b ceaseth to strive 
with man then cometh speedy de-
struction,  and  this  grieveth  my  
soul.
