that the words of our fathers may 
be fulfilled, according to that which 
they have spoken concerning him, 
which was according to the spirit 
of prophecy which was in them.

27 And now, my brethren, I a wish 
from the inmost part of my heart, 
yea, with great b anxiety even unto 
pain, that ye would hearken unto 
my  words,  and  cast  off  your  sins, 
and  not  c procrastinate  the  day  of 
your repentance;

28 But  that  ye  would  humble 
yourselves  before  the  Lord,  and 
call on his holy name, and a watch 
and pray continually, that ye may 
not be b tempted above that which 
ye  can  bear,  and  thus  be  c led  by 
the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, 
d meek, submissive, patient, full of 
love and all long-suffering;

29 a Having faith on the Lord; hav-
ing  a  hope  that  ye  shall  receive 
eternal life; having the b love of God 
always in your hearts, that ye may 
be lifted up at the last day and en-
ter into his c rest.

30 And may the Lord grant unto 
you  repentance,  that  ye  may  not 
bring  down  his  wrath  upon  you, 
that  ye  may  not  be  a bound  down 
by the chains of b hell, that ye may 
not suffer the second c death.

31 And  Alma  spake  many  more 
words unto the people, which are 
not written in a this book.
