3 Now Aaron had gone up to the 
land of Nephi, therefore the king 
could not confer the kingdom upon 
him;  a neither  would  Aaron  take 
upon him the kingdom; neither were 
any of the b sons of Mosiah c willing 
to take upon them the kingdom.

4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again  
among the people; yea, even a writ-
ten word sent he among the people. 
And these were the words that were 
written, saying:

5 Behold, O ye my people, or my 
brethren, for I esteem you as such, 
I desire that ye should consider the 
cause which ye are called to a con-
sider—for ye are desirous to have  
a king.

6 Now I declare unto you that he 
to whom the kingdom doth rightly 
belong has declined, and will not 
take upon him the kingdom.

7 And now if there should be an-
other appointed in his stead, behold 
I fear there would rise a contentions

among you. And who knoweth but 
what  my  son,  to  whom  the  king-
dom  doth  belong,  should  turn  to 
be  angry  and  b draw  away  a  part 
of  this  people  after  him,  which 
would cause wars and contentions 
among  you,  which  would  be  the 
cause of shedding much blood and 
perverting  the  way  of  the  Lord, 
yea, and destroy the souls of many  
people.

8 Now I say unto you let us be wise 
and  consider  these  things,  for  we 
have  no  right  to  destroy  my  son, 
neither should we have any right 
to destroy another if he should be 
appointed in his stead.

9 And  if  my  son  should  turn 
again to his pride and vain things 
he  would  recall  the  things  which 
he had said, and claim his right to 
the  kingdom,  which  would  cause 
him  and  also  this  people  to  com-
mit much sin.

10 And  now  let  us  be  wise  and 
look forward to these things, and 
do  that  which  will  make  for  the 
peace of this people.

11 Therefore I will be your king 
the remainder of my days; never-
theless, let a us appoint b judges, to 
judge this people according to our 
law; and we will newly arrange the 
affairs  of  this  people,  for  we  will 
appoint wise men to be judges, that 
will judge this people according to 
the commandments of God.
