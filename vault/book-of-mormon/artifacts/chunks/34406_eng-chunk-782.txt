16 And thus Satan did lead away 
the hearts of the people to do all 
manner of iniquity; therefore they 
had enjoyed peace but a few years.
17 And thus, in the commencement 
of  the  thirtieth  year—the  people 
having been a delivered up for the 
space of a long time to be carried 
about  by  the  b temptations  of  the 
devil whithersoever he desired to 
carry them, and to do whatsoever 
iniquity he desired they should—
and thus in the commencement of 
this, the thirtieth year, they were in 
a state of awful wickedness.

18 Now  they  did  not  sin  a igno-
rantly, for they knew the b will of God 
concerning  them,  for  it  had  been 
taught  unto  them;  therefore  they  
did wilfully c rebel against God.

19 And now it was in the days of 
Lachoneus, the son of a Lachoneus, 
for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his 
father  and  did  govern  the  people  
that year.

20 And there began to be men a in-
spired from heaven and sent forth, 
standing among the people in all 
the land, preaching and testifying 
boldly of the sins and iniquities of 
the people, and testifying unto them 
concerning the redemption which 
the Lord would make for his peo-
ple, or in other words, the resurrec-
tion of Christ; and they did testify 
boldly of his b death and sufferings.
21 Now  there  were  many  of  the 
people who were exceedingly an-
gry because of those who testified 
of these things; and those who were 
angry were chiefly the chief judges, 
and they who a had been high priests 
and lawyers; yea, all those who were

lawyers were angry with those who 
testified of these things.

22 Now there was no lawyer nor 
judge  nor  high  priest  that  could 
have power to condemn any one to 
death save their condemnation was 
signed by the governor of the land.
23 Now there were many of those 
a who testified of the things pertain-
ing to Christ who testified boldly, 
who were taken and put to death 
b secretly  by  the  judges,  that  the 
knowledge of their death came not 
unto the governor of the land until 
after their death.

24 Now behold, this was contrary 
to  the  laws  of  the  land,  that  any 
man should be put to death except 
they had power from the governor 
of the land—
