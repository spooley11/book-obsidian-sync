led  by  a  man  whose  name  was 
Zoram—and  as  he  went  forth 
amongst them, behold, he was run 
upon and trodden down, even until 
he was b dead.

60 And  thus  we  see  the  end  of 
him  who  a perverteth  the  ways  of 
the Lord; and thus we see that the 
devil will not b support his children 
at  the  last  day,  but  doth  speedily 
drag them down to c hell.

CHAPTER 31
Alma heads a mission to reclaim the 
apostate  Zoramites—The  Zoramites 
deny  Christ,  believe  in  a  false  con-
cept of election, and worship with set 
prayers—The  missionaries  are  filled 
with the Holy Spirit—Their afflictions 
are swallowed up in the joy of Christ. 
About 74 b.c.
Now it came to pass that after the end 
of Korihor, Alma having received  
tidings that the Zoramites were per-
verting the ways of the Lord, and 
that Zoram, who was their leader, 
was leading the hearts of the peo-
ple to  a bow down to dumb  b idols, 
his heart again began to c sicken be-
cause of the iniquity of the people.
2 For it was the cause of great a sor-
row  to  Alma  to  know  of  iniquity 
among  his  people;  therefore  his 
heart  was  exceedingly  b sorrowful 
because  of  the  separation  of  the 
Zoramites from the Nephites.

3 Now  the  Zoramites  had  gath-
ered themselves together in a land 
which they called a Antionum, which 
was east of the land of Zarahemla, 
which lay nearly bordering upon the

seashore, which was south of the land 
of  b Jershon,  which  also  bordered 
upon the wilderness south, which  
wilderness was full of the Lamanites.
4 Now the Nephites greatly feared 
that the Zoramites would enter into 
a  a correspondence  with  the  La-
manites, and that it would be the 
means of great loss on the part of 
the Nephites.
