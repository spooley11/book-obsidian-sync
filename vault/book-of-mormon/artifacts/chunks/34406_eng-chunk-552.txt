11 And  thou  didst  hear  me  be-
cause  of  mine  afflictions  and  my 
a sincerity; and it is because of thy 
Son that thou hast been thus mer-
ciful unto me, therefore I will cry 
unto thee in all mine  b afflictions, 
for in thee is my joy; for thou hast 
turned thy judgments away from 
me, c because of thy Son.

12 And now Alma said unto them: 
Do ye a believe those scriptures which  
have been written by them of old?
13 Behold,  if  ye  do,  ye  must  be-
lieve what a Zenos said; for, behold 
he said: Thou hast turned away thy 
judgments because of thy Son.

14 Now  behold,  my  brethren,  I 
would ask if ye have read the scrip-
tures? If ye have, how can ye a dis-
believe on the Son of God?

15 For it is  a not written that Ze-
nos alone spake of these things, but 
b Zenock also spake of these things—
16 For behold, he said: Thou art 
angry, O Lord, with this people, be-
cause they a will not understand thy 
mercies which thou hast bestowed 
upon them because of thy Son.

17 And now, my brethren, ye see 
that  a  second  prophet  of  old  has 
testified of the Son of God, and be-
cause the people would not under-
stand his words they  a stoned him  
to death.

18 But behold, this is not all; these

are  not  the  only  ones  who  have 
spoken concerning the Son of God.
19 Behold,  he  was  spoken  of  by 
a Moses; yea, and behold a b type was 
c raised  up  in  the  wilderness,  that 
whosoever would look upon it might 
live. And many did look and live.
20 But few understood the mean-
ing of those things, and this because 
of  the  hardness  of  their  hearts. 
But there were many who were so 
hardened that they would not look, 
therefore  they  perished.  Now  the 
reason they would not look is be-
cause they did not believe that it 
would a heal them.

21 O my brethren, if ye could be 
healed  by  merely  casting  about 
your eyes that ye might be healed, 
would  ye  not  behold  quickly,  or 
would ye rather harden your hearts 
in a unbelief, and be b slothful, that 
ye would not cast about your eyes, 
that ye might perish?
