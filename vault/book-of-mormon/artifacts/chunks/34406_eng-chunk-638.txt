4 And it came to pass that he did 
command  that  his  people  should 
maintain those cities, which they 
had taken by the shedding of blood; 
for  they  had  not  taken  any  cities 
save they had lost much blood.

5 And  now,  Teancum  saw  that 
the  Lamanites  were  determined 
to  maintain  those  cities  which 
they had taken, and those parts of 
the land which they had obtained 
possession of; and also seeing the 
enormity of their number, Teancum 
thought it was not expedient that 
he should attempt to attack them in  
their forts.

6 But he kept his men round about, 
as if making preparations for war; 
yea, and truly he was preparing to 
defend  himself  against  them,  by 
a casting up walls round about and 
preparing places of resort.

7 And it came to pass that he kept 
thus preparing for war until Moroni 
had sent a large number of men to 
strengthen his army.

8 And Moroni also sent orders unto 
him  that  he  should  retain  all  the 
prisoners who fell into his hands; for 
as the Lamanites had taken many 
prisoners, that he should retain all 
the prisoners of the Lamanites as 
a a ransom for those whom the La-
manites had taken.

9 And  he  also  sent  orders  unto 
him that he should fortify the land 
a Bountiful, and secure the b narrow 
pass which led into the land c north-
ward,  lest  the  Lamanites  should 
obtain that point and should have 
power  to  harass  them  on  every  
side.
