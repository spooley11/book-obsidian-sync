soon  after  Moroni  had  sent  his 
epistle unto the chief governor, he 
received an epistle from a Pahoran, 
the chief governor. And these are 
the words which he received:

2 I,  Pahoran,  who  am  the  chief 
governor of this land, do send these 
words unto Moroni, the chief cap-
tain  over  the  army.  Behold,  I  say 
unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy 
in  your  great  a afflictions,  yea,  it 
grieves my soul.

3 But behold, there are those who 
do joy in your afflictions, yea, in-
somuch that they have risen up in 
a rebellion against me, and also those 
of  my  people  who  are  b freemen, 
yea, and those who have risen up 
are exceedingly numerous.

4 And it is those who have sought 
to  take  away  the  judgment-seat 
from me that have been the cause 
of this great iniquity; for they have 
used great a flattery, and they have 
b led away the hearts of many peo-
ple,  which  will  be  the  cause  of 
sore affliction among us; they have 
withheld our provisions, and have 
daunted  our  c freemen  that  they 
have not come unto you.

5 And  behold,  they  have  driven 
me  out  before  them,  and  I  have 
fled to the land of Gideon, with as 
many men as it were possible that 
I could get.

6 And behold, I have sent a procla-
mation throughout this part of the 
land; and behold, they are  a flock-
ing  to  us  b daily,  to  their  arms,  in 
the  defence  of  their  country  and 
their c freedom, and to avenge our  
d wrongs.

7 And they have come unto us, in-
somuch that those who have risen 
up in rebellion against us are set at 
defiance, yea, insomuch that they 
do fear us and durst not come out 
against us to battle.
