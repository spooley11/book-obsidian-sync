8 And it came to pass after we had 
all gone down into the ship, and had 
taken  with  us  our  provisions  and 
things which had been commanded 
us, we did put forth into the  a sea 
and  were  driven  forth  before  the 
wind towards the b promised land.
9 And after we had been  a driven 
forth before the wind for the space 
of many days, behold, my brethren 
and  the  sons  of  Ishmael  and  also 
their  wives  began  to  make  them-
selves  merry,  insomuch  that  they 
began to dance, and to sing, and to 
speak with much b rudeness, yea, even 
that they did forget by what power 
they had been brought thither; yea, 
they were lifted up unto exceeding 
rudeness.

10 And  I,  Nephi,  began  to  fear 
exceedingly  lest  the  Lord  should 
be angry with us, and smite us be-
cause of our iniquity, that we should 
be swallowed up in the depths of 
the  sea;  wherefore,  I,  Nephi,  be-
gan  to  speak  to  them  with  much 
soberness;  but  behold  they  were  
a angry with me, saying: We will not 
that our younger brother shall be a  
b ruler over us.

11 And it came to pass that Laman 
and Lemuel did take me and a bind 
me with cords, and they did treat 
me with much harshness; neverthe-
less, the Lord did suffer it that he 
might show forth his power, unto the

fulfilling of his word which he had 
b spoken concerning the wicked.

12 And it came to pass that after 
they had bound me insomuch that 
I  could  not  move,  the  a compass, 
which  had  been  prepared  of  the 
Lord, did cease to work.

13 Wherefore,  they  knew  not 
whither they should steer the ship, 
insomuch that there arose a great 
a storm, yea, a great and terrible tem-
pest, and we were b driven back upon 
the  waters  for  the  space  of  three 
days; and they began to be fright-
ened exceedingly lest they should 
be drowned in the sea; nevertheless  
they did not loose me.
