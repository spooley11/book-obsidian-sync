19 And now it came to pass that I, 
Nephi, was exceedingly sorrowful 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts; and now when they saw that 
I began to be sorrowful they were 
glad in their hearts, insomuch that 
they did  a rejoice over me, saying: 
We  knew  that  ye  could  not  con-
struct a ship, for we knew that ye 
were lacking in judgment; where-
fore, thou canst not accomplish so 
great a work.

20 And  thou  art  like  unto  our 
father,  led  away  by  the  foolish 
a imagi nations  of  his  heart;  yea, 
he  hath  led  us  out  of  the  land  of  
Jerusalem, and we have wandered 
in  the  wilderness  for  these  many 
years; and our women have toiled, 
being big with child; and they have 
borne  children  in  the  wilderness 
and  suffered  all  things,  save  it 
were death; and it would have been  
better  that  they  had  died  before 
they  came  out  of  Jerusalem  than 
to have suffered these afflictions.

21 Behold,  these  many  years  we 
have  suffered  in  the  wilderness, 
which time we might have enjoyed 
our possessions and the land of our 
inheritance; yea, and we might have 
been happy.

22 And we know that the people 
who were in the land of Jerusalem 
were a a righteous people; for they 
kept  the  statutes  and  judgments 
of the Lord, and all his command-
ments,  according  to  the  law  of  
Moses;  wherefore,  we  know  that 
they are a righteous people; and our

father hath judged them, and hath  
led  us  away  because  we  would 
hearken  unto  his  words;  yea,  and 
our brother is like unto him. And 
after this manner of language did 
my brethren murmur and complain 
against us.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do  
ye believe that our fathers, who were 
the children of Israel, would have 
been led away out of the hands of 
the a Egyptians if they had not heark-
ened unto the words of the Lord?

24 Yea,  do  ye  suppose  that  they 
would have been led out of bond-
age, if the Lord had not commanded 
Moses  that  he  should  a lead  them 
out of bondage?
