21 I say unto you that if ye should 
a serve  him  who  has  created  you 
from  the  beginning,  and  is  b pre-
serving  you  from  day  to  day,  by 
lending  you  c breath,  that  ye  may 
live and move and do according to 
your own d will, and even supporting 
you from one moment to another—I 
say, if ye should serve him with all 
your e whole souls yet ye would be 
f unprofitable servants.

22 And  behold,  all  that  he  a re-
quires of you is to  b keep his com-
mandments; and he has c promised 
you that if ye would keep his com-
mandments ye should prosper in the 
land; and he never doth d vary from 
that which he hath said; therefore,

if ye do e keep his f commandments 
he doth bless you and prosper you.
23 And now, in the first place, he 
hath created you, and granted unto 
you your lives, for which ye are in-
debted unto him.

24 And secondly, he doth a require 
that ye should do as he hath com-
manded you; for which if ye do, he 
doth immediately  b bless you; and 
therefore  he  hath  paid  you.  And 
ye are still indebted unto him, and 
are, and will be, forever and ever; 
therefore, of what have ye to boast?
25 And now I ask, can ye say aught 
of  yourselves?  I  answer  you,  Nay. 
Ye cannot say that ye are even as 
much as the dust of the earth; yet 
ye were a created of the b dust of the 
earth; but behold, it c belongeth to 
him who created you.

26 And  I,  even  I,  whom  ye  call 
your  king,  am  a no  better  than  ye 
yourselves are; for I am also of the 
dust. And ye behold that I am old, 
and am about to yield up this mor-
tal frame to its mother earth.

27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I 
had a served you, b walking with a clear 
conscience before God, even so I at 
this time have caused that ye should 
assemble yourselves together, that I 
might be found blameless, and that 
your  c blood should not come upon 
me, when I shall stand to be judged 
of God of the things whereof he hath 
commanded me concerning you.
