CHAPTER 8
The  Lamanites  seek  out  and  destroy 
the  Nephites—The  Book  of  Mormon 
will come forth by the power of God—
Woes  pronounced  upon  those  who 
breathe out wrath and strife against the 
work of the Lord—The Nephite record 
will  come  forth  in  a  day  of  wicked-
ness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About  
a.d. 400–421.
Behold  I,  a Moroni,  do  finish  the 
b record of my father, Mormon. Be-
hold, I have but few things to write,  
which  things  I  have  been  com-
manded by my father.

2 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
after  the  a great  and  tremendous 
battle  at  Cumorah,  behold,  the 
Nephites who had escaped into the 
country southward were hunted by 
the b Lamanites, until they were all  
destroyed.

3 And my father also was killed by 
them, and I even a remain b alone to 
write the sad tale of the destruction 
of my people. But behold, they are 
gone, and I fulfil the commandment 
of my father. And whether they will 
slay me, I know not.

4 Therefore I will write and a hide 
up  the  records  in  the  earth;  and 
whither I go it mattereth not.

5 Behold,  my  father  hath  made 
a this  record,  and  he  hath  written 
the  intent  thereof.  And  behold,  I 
would  write  it  also  if  I  had  room 
upon  the  b plates,  but  I  have  not; 
and ore I have none, for I am alone. 
My father hath been slain in battle, 
and all my kinsfolk, and I have not

friends nor whither to go; and c how 
long the Lord will suffer that I may 
live I know not.

6 Behold, a four hundred years have 
passed  away  since  the  coming  of 
our Lord and Savior.

7 And behold, the Lamanites have 
hunted  my  people,  the  Nephites, 
down  from  city  to  city  and  from 
place to place, even until they are 
no more; and great has been their 
a fall;  yea,  great  and  marvelous  is 
the destruction of my people, the 
Nephites.

8 And behold, it is the hand of the 
Lord which hath done it. And behold 
also, the Lamanites are at a war one 
with another; and the whole face of 
this land is one continual round of 
murder and bloodshed; and no one 
knoweth the end of the war.
