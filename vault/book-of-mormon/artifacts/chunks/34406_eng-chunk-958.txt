The iniquity of the people brings a curse 
upon the land—Coriantumr engages in 
warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and 
then  Shiz—Blood  and  carnage  cover 
the land.
And now there began to be a great 
a curse upon all the land because of 
the iniquity of the people, in which, 
if a man should lay his tool or his 
sword upon his shelf, or upon the 
place  whither  he  would  keep  it, 
behold, upon the morrow, he could 
not find it, so great was the curse 
upon the land.

2 Wherefore every man did cleave

8 Now the brother of Shared, whose 
name was Gilead, also received great 
strength to his army, because of se-
cret combinations.

9 And it came to pass that his high 
priest murdered him as he sat upon 
his throne.

10 And it came to pass that one of 
the secret combinations murdered 
him in a secret pass, and obtained 
unto himself the kingdom; and his 
name was Lib; and Lib was a man of 
great stature, more than any other 
man among all the people.

11 And it came to pass that in the 
first year of Lib, Coriantumr came 
up  unto  the  land  of  Moron,  and 
gave battle unto Lib.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
fought with Lib, in which Lib did 
smite  upon  his  arm  that  he  was 
wounded;  nevertheless,  the  army 
of  Coriantumr  did  press  forward 
upon Lib, that he fled to the bor-
ders upon the seashore.

13 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr pursued him; and Lib gave 
battle unto him upon the seashore.
14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lib 
did smite the army of Coriantumr, 
that they fled again to the wilder-
ness of Akish.

15 And it came to pass that Lib did 
pursue  him  until  he  came  to  the 
plains  of  Agosh.  And  Coriantumr 
had taken all the people with him 
as he fled before Lib in that quarter 
of the land whither he fled.
