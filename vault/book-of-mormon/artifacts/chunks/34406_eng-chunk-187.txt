—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—
Compare Isaiah 13. About 559–545 b.c.

a The  burden  of  b Babylon,  which 
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

2 Lift  ye  up  a  banner  upon  the 
high mountain, exalt the voice unto 
them,  a shake  the  hand,  that  they 
may go into the gates of the nobles.
3 I have commanded my sanctified 
ones, I have also called my a mighty 
ones,  for  mine  anger  is  not  upon 
them that rejoice in my highness.
4 The  noise  of  the  multitude  in 
the  mountains  like  as  of  a  great 
people, a tumultuous noise of the 
a kingdoms of nations b gathered to-
gether, the Lord of Hosts mustereth 
the hosts of the battle.

5 They come from a far country, 
from  the  end  of  heaven,  yea,  the 
Lord, and the weapons of his indig-
nation, to destroy the whole land.
6 Howl ye, for the a day of the Lord 
is  at  hand;  it  shall  come  as  a  de-
struction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore  shall  all  hands  be 
faint, every man’s heart shall a melt;
8 And they shall be afraid; pangs 
and sorrows shall take hold of them; 
they shall be amazed one at another; 
their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold,  the  day  of  the  Lord 
cometh, cruel both with wrath and 
fierce anger, to lay the land deso-
late; and he shall a destroy the sin-
ners thereof out of it.

10 For  the  a stars  of  heaven  and 
the b constellations thereof shall not 
give their  c light; the  d sun shall be 
darkened  in  his  going  forth,  and

the moon shall not cause her light 
to shine.

11 And  I  will  a punish  the  world 
for evil, and the b wicked for their 
iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy 
of the c proud to cease, and will lay  
down the haughtiness of the terrible.
12 I will make a a man more pre-
cious  than  fine  gold;  even  a  man 
than the golden wedge of Ophir.
