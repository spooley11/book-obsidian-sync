23 And  Ammon  said  unto  him: 
Yea, I desire to  a dwell among this 
people for a time; yea, and perhaps 
until the day I die.

24 And it came to pass that king 
Lamoni  was  much  pleased  with 
Ammon, and caused that his bands 
should  be  loosed;  and  he  would 
that Ammon should take one of his 
daughters to wife.

25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, 
but I will be thy servant. Therefore 
Ammon became a a servant to king 
Lamoni. And it came to pass that 
he was set among other servants to 
watch the flocks of Lamoni, accord-
ing to the custom of the Lamanites.
26 And after he had been in the 
service of the king three days, as he 
was with the Lamanitish servants 
going forth with their flocks to the 
place of  a water, which was called 
the water of Sebus, and all the La-
manites  drive  their  flocks  hither, 
that they may have water—

27 Therefore, as Ammon and the 
servants of the king were driving 
forth  their  flocks  to  this  place  of 
water, behold, a certain number of 
the Lamanites, who had been with 
their  flocks  to  water,  stood  and 
a scattered the flocks of Ammon and 
the servants of the king, and they 
scattered them insomuch that they 
fled many ways.

28 Now  the  servants  of  the  king 
began  to  murmur,  saying:  Now 
the king will slay us, as he has our 
brethren because their flocks were

scattered by the wickedness of these 
men. And they began to weep ex-
ceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks 
are scattered already.

29 Now they wept because of the 
fear of being slain. Now when Am-
mon saw this his heart was swollen 
within him with joy; for, said he, 
I  will  show  forth  my  power  unto 
these  my  fellow-servants,  or  the 
power which is in me, in restoring 
these  flocks  unto  the  king,  that  I 
may  win  the  hearts  of  these  my  
fellow-servants,  that  I  may  lead 
them to a believe in my words.

30 And  now,  these  were  the 
thoughts of Ammon, when he saw 
the  afflictions  of  those  whom  he 
termed to be his brethren.
