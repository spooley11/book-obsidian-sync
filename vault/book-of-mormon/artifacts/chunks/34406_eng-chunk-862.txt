28 They  will  also  be  among  the 
Jews,  and  the  Jews  shall  know 
them not.

29 And it shall come to pass, when 
the  Lord  seeth  fit  in  his  wisdom 
that they shall minister unto all the 
a scattered tribes of Israel, and unto 
all nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people, and shall bring out of them 
unto  Jesus  many  souls,  that  their 
desire  may  be  fulfilled,  and  also 
because  of  the  convincing  power 
of God which is in them.

30 And they are as the a angels of 
God, and if they shall pray unto the 
Father in the name of Jesus they can 
show themselves unto whatsoever 
man it seemeth them good.

31 Therefore, great and marvelous 
works  shall  be  wrought  by  them, 
before the  a great and coming day 
when all people must surely stand 
before the judgment-seat of Christ;
32 Yea  even  among  the  Gentiles 
shall there be a a great and marvel-
ous work wrought by them, before 
that judgment day.
