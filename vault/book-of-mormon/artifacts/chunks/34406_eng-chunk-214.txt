17 But behold, if the inhabitants 
of  the  earth  shall  repent  of  their 
wickedness and abominations they 
shall  not  be  destroyed,  saith  the 
Lord of Hosts.

18 But  behold,  that  great  and 
a abominable  church,  the  b whore 
of  all  the  earth,  must  c tumble  to

the  earth,  and  great  must  be  the 
fall thereof.

19 For  the  kingdom  of  the  devil 
must a shake, and they which belong 
to it must needs be stirred up unto 
repentance, or the b devil will grasp 
them with his everlasting c chains, 
and  they  be  stirred  up  to  anger, 
and perish;

20 For behold, at that day shall he 
a rage in the b hearts of the children 
of men, and stir them up to anger 
against that which is good.

21 And others will he a pacify, and 
lull them away into carnal  b secu-
rity, that they will say: All is well 
in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is 
well—and thus the c devil d cheateth 
their souls, and leadeth them away 
carefully down to hell.

22 And behold, others he a flattereth 
away, and telleth them there is no 
b hell; and he saith unto them: I am 
no devil, for there is none—and thus  
he whispereth in their ears, until he  
grasps them with his awful c chains, 
from whence there is no deliverance.
23 Yea,  they  are  grasped  with 
death,  and  hell;  and  death,  and 
hell,  and  the  devil,  and  all  that 
have  been  seized  therewith  must 
stand  before  the  throne  of  God, 
and be a judged according to their 
works, from whence they must go 
into the place prepared for them, 
even a b lake of fire and brimstone, 
which is endless torment.

24 Therefore, wo be unto him that

is at a ease in Zion!
