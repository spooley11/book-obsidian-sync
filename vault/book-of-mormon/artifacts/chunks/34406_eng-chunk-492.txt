4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: 
I know, in the a strength of the Lord 
thou canst do all things. But behold, 
I will go with thee to the land of  
Middoni; for the king of the land  
of  Middoni,  whose  name  is  Anti-
omno, is a friend unto me; therefore 
I go to the land of Middoni, that I 
may  flatter  the  king  of  the  land, 
and he will cast thy brethren out 
of b prison. Now Lamoni said unto 
him: Who told thee that thy breth-
ren were in prison?

5 And Ammon said unto him: No 
one hath told me, save it be God; 
and he said unto me—Go and de-
liver thy brethren, for they are in 
prison in the land of Middoni.

6 Now  when  Lamoni  had  heard 
this  he  caused  that  his  servants 
should make ready his a horses and 
his chariots.

7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, 
I will go with thee down to the land 
of Middoni, and there I will plead 
with the king that he will cast thy 
brethren out of prison.

8 And it came to pass that as Am-
mon and Lamoni were journeying

thither,  they  met  the  father  of 
Lamoni,  who  was  king  a over  all  
the land.

9 And  behold,  the  father  of  La-
moni  said  unto  him:  Why  did  ye 
a not come to the b feast on that great 
day when I made a feast unto my 
sons, and unto my people?

10 And he also said: Whither art 
thou going with this Nephite, who 
is one of the children of a a liar?

11 And it came to pass that La-
moni rehearsed unto him whither 
he was going, for he feared to offend  
him.
