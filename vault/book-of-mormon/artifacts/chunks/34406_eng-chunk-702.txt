9 And it came to pass in the sixti-
eth year of the reign of the judges, 
Moronihah  did  succeed  with  his 
armies in obtaining many parts of 
the land; yea, they regained many 
cities  which  had  fallen  into  the 
hands of the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass in the sixty 
and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges they succeeded in regaining 
even the half of all their possessions.
11 Now this great loss of the Neph-
ites, and the great slaughter which 
was among them, a would not have 
happened had it not been for their 
b wickedness and their abomination 
which was among them; yea, and it 
was among those also who professed 
to belong to the church of God.

12 And it was because of the a pride 
of their hearts, because of their ex-
ceeding b riches, yea, it was because 
of  their  oppression  to  the  c poor, 
withholding  their  food  from  the 
hungry, withholding their clothing 
from the naked, and smiting their 
humble brethren upon the cheek, 
making  a  d mock  of  that  which 
was  sacred,  denying  the  spirit  of 
prophecy  and  of  revelation,  mur-
dering, plundering, lying, stealing,

committing adultery, rising up in 
great  contentions,  and  deserting 
away into the land of Nephi, among 
the Lamanites—

13 And because of this their great 
wickedness,  and  their  a boastings  
in  their  own  strength,  they  were 
left in their own strength; therefore  
they  did  not  prosper,  but  were  
afflicted  and  smitten,  and  driven 
before  the  Lamanites,  until  they 
had  lost  possession  of  almost  all 
their lands.
