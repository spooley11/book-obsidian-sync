9 And now the design of the Neph-
ites was to support their lands, and  
their  houses,  and  their  a wives,  
and their children, that they might 
preserve  them  from  the  hands  of 
their  enemies;  and  also  that  they 
might  preserve  their  b rights  and 
their privileges, yea, and also their 
c liberty,  that  they  might  worship 
God according to their desires.

10 For  they  knew  that  if  they 
should  fall  into  the  hands  of  the 
Lamanites, that whosoever should 
a worship God in b spirit and in truth, 
the true and the living God, the La-
manites would c destroy.

11 Yea,  and  they  also  knew  the 
extreme  hatred  of  the  Lamanites 
towards their a brethren, who were 
the  b people  of  Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
who were called the people of Am-
mon—and they would not take up 
arms, yea, they had entered into a 
covenant and they would not break 
it—therefore,  if  they  should  fall 
into  the  hands  of  the  Lamanites 
they would be destroyed.

12 And the Nephites would not suf-
fer that they should be destroyed; 
therefore they gave them lands for 
their inheritance.

ALMA 43  : 13–24

13 And the people of Ammon did 
give unto the Nephites a large por-
tion of their substance to a support 
their armies; and thus the Nephites 
were compelled, alone, to withstand 
against the Lamanites, who were a 
compound of Laman and Lemuel, 
and  the  sons  of  Ishmael,  and  all 
those who had dissented from the 
Nephites, who were Amalekites and 
Zoramites, and the b descendants of 
the priests of Noah.
