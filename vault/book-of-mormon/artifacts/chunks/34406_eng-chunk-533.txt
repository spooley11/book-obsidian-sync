19 Now this man went over to the 
land  of  a Jershon  also,  to  preach 
these things among the people of 
Ammon, who were once the people 
of the Lamanites.

20 But behold they were more wise 
than many of the Nephites; for they 
took him, and bound him, and car-
ried him before Ammon, who was 
a a high priest over that people.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
caused  that  he  should  be  carried 
out of the land. And he came over 
into the land of Gideon, and began 
to preach unto them also; and here 
he did not have much success, for he 
was taken and bound and carried 
before the high priest, and also the 
chief judge over the land.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
high priest said unto him: Why do 
ye  go  about  perverting  the  ways 
of the Lord? Why do ye teach this  
people that there shall be no Christ, 
to interrupt their rejoicings? Why 
do ye speak against all the prophe-
cies of the holy prophets?

23 Now the high priest’s name was 
Giddonah. And Korihor said unto 
him:  Because  I  do  not  teach  the 
foolish  traditions  of  your  fathers, 
and because I do not teach this peo-
ple to bind themselves down under 
the foolish ordinances and perfor-
mances  which  are  laid  down  by 
ancient priests, to usurp power and 
authority over them, to keep them 
in  ignorance,  that  they  may  not 
lift up their heads, but be brought 
down according to thy words.
