26 And a not many days hence the 
Son of God shall come in his b glory; 
and his glory shall be the glory of 
the  Only  Begotten  of  the  Father, 
full  of  c grace,  equity,  and  truth, 
full of patience, d mercy, and long-
suffering, quick to  e hear the cries 
of his people and to answer their  
prayers.

27 And behold, he cometh to a re-
deem those who will be b baptized 
unto repentance, through faith on 
his name.

28 Therefore, prepare ye the way 
of the Lord, for the time is at hand 
that all men shall reap a  a reward 
of their  b works, according to that 
which they have been—if they have 
been righteous they shall c reap the 
salvation of their souls, according to 
the power and deliverance of Jesus 
Christ; and if they have been evil 
they shall reap the d damnation of 
their souls, according to the power 
and captivation of the devil.

29 Now behold, this is the voice of 
the angel, crying unto the people.
30 And  now,  my  a beloved  breth-
ren, for ye are my brethren, and ye 
ought to be beloved, and ye ought 
to bring forth works which are meet 
for  repentance,  seeing  that  your 
hearts have been grossly hardened 
against the word of God, and see-

ing that ye are a b lost and a fallen  
people.

31 Now it came to pass that when 
I,  Alma,  had  spoken  these  words, 
behold,  the  people  were  wroth 
with me because I said unto them 
that they were a hard-hearted and 
a a stiffnecked people.

32 And  also  because  I  said  unto 
them  that  they  were  a  lost  and  a 
fallen people they were angry with 
me, and sought to lay their hands 
upon me, that they might cast me 
into prison.

33 But  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did not suffer them that they 
should  take  me  a at  that  time  and 
cast me into prison.

34 And it came to pass that Amu-
lek went and stood forth, and be-
gan to preach unto them also. And 
now the a words of Amulek are not 
all written, nevertheless a part of 
his words are written in this book.
