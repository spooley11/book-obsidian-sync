31 And  they  cried  unto  us,  say-
ing—Behold, the armies of the La-
manites are marching towards the 
city  of  Cumeni;  and  behold,  they 
will fall upon them, yea, and will 
destroy our people.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  our 
prisoners did hear their cries, which  
caused them to take courage; and 
they did rise up in rebellion against 
us.

33 And it came to pass because of 
their  rebellion  we  did  cause  that 
our swords should come upon them. 
And it came to pass that they did 
in a body run upon our swords, in 
the which, the greater number of 
them were slain; and the remainder  
of  them  broke  through  and  fled 
from us.

34 And behold, when they had fled 
and we could not overtake them, we 
took our march with speed towards 
the city Cumeni; and behold, we did 
arrive in time that we might assist 
our brethren in preserving the city.
35 And behold, we are again de-
livered out of the hands of our en-
emies. And blessed is the name of 
our  God;  for  behold,  it  is  he  that 
has delivered us; yea, that has done 
this great thing for us.

36 Now it came to pass that when 
I, Helaman, had heard these words 
of Gid, I was filled with exceeding 
joy because of the goodness of God 
in  preserving  us,  that  we  might 
not all perish; yea, and I trust that 
the  souls  of  them  who  have  been 
slain have a entered into the rest of 
their God.

CHAPTER 58
Helaman, Gid, and Teomner take the 
city  of  Manti  by  a  stratagem—The 
Lamanites withdraw—The sons of the 
people of Ammon are preserved as they 
stand fast in defense of their liberty and 
faith. About 63–62 b.c.

And  behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that our next object was to obtain 
the city of Manti; but behold, there 
was no way that we could lead them 
out of the city by our small bands. 
For behold, they remembered that 
which we had hitherto done; there-
fore we could not a decoy them away 
from their strongholds.

2 And  they  were  so  much  more 
numerous than was our army that 
we  durst  not  go  forth  and  attack 
them in their strongholds.
