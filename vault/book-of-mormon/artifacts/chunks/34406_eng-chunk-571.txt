27 And now, my son, I command 
you that ye retain all their oaths, 
and their covenants, and their agree-
ments in their secret abominations; 
yea, and all their  a signs and their 
wonders  ye  shall  b keep  from  this 
people, that they know them not, 
lest peradventure they should fall 
into darkness also and be destroyed.
28 For  behold,  there  is  a  a curse 
upon all this land, that destruction 
shall come upon all those workers 
of darkness, according to the power 
of  God,  when  they  are  fully  ripe; 
therefore I desire that this people 
might not be destroyed.

29 Therefore ye shall keep these 
secret  plans  of  their  a oaths  and 
their  covenants  from  this  people, 
and  only  their  wickedness  and 
their murders and their abomina-
tions  shall  ye  make  known  unto 
them;  and  ye  shall  teach  them  to 
b abhor such wickedness and abomi-
nations and murders; and ye shall 
also teach them that these people 
were destroyed on account of their 
wickedness and abominations and 
their murders.

30 For behold, they a murdered all 
the prophets of the Lord who came 
among them to declare unto them 
concerning  their  iniquities;  and 
the blood of those whom they mur-
dered did cry unto the Lord their 
God for vengeance upon those who 
were their murderers; and thus the 
judgments of God did come upon 
these workers of darkness and se-
cret b combinations.

31 Yea, and a cursed be the land for-
ever and ever unto those workers of
