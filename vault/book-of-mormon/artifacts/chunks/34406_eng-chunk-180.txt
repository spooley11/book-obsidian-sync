17 Therefore the Lord shall have 
no joy in their young men, neither 
shall have a mercy on their fatherless 
and b widows; for c every one of them 
is a hypocrite and an d evildoer, and 
every mouth speaketh e folly. For all 
this his anger is not turned away, 
but his f  hand is stretched out still.
18 For  a wickedness  burneth  as 
the fire; it shall devour the briers 
and thorns, and shall kindle in the 
thickets  of  the  forests,  and  they 
shall mount up like the lifting up 
of smoke.

19 Through the wrath of the Lord 
of Hosts is the a land darkened, and 
the people shall be as the fuel of the  
fire; b no man shall spare his brother.
20 And he a shall snatch on the right 
hand and be hungry; and he shall 
b eat on the left hand and they shall 
not be satisfied; they shall eat ev-
ery man the flesh of his own arm—
21 Manasseh,  a Ephraim;  and 
Ephraim, Manasseh; they together 
shall be against b Judah. For all this 
his anger is not turned away, but 
his hand is stretched out still.

CHAPTER 20

The  destruction  of  Assyria  is  a  type 
of the destruction of the wicked at the 
Second Coming—Few people will be left

after the Lord comes again—The rem-
nant of Jacob will return in that day—
Compare Isaiah 10. About 559–545 b.c.
a Wo  unto  them  that  decree  b un-
righteous  decrees,  and  that  write  
grievousness which they have pre-
scribed;

2 To  turn  away  the  needy  from 
judgment,  and  to  take  away  the 
right from the a poor of my people, 
that b widows may be their prey, and 
that they may rob the fatherless!

3 And what will ye do in the day 
of visitation, and in the desolation 
which shall come from far? to whom 
will ye flee for help? and where will  
ye leave your glory ?

4 Without me they shall bow down 
under the prisoners, and they shall 
fall under the slain. For all this his 
anger is not turned away, but his 
hand is stretched out still.

5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine an-
ger, and the staff in their hand is 
a their indignation.
