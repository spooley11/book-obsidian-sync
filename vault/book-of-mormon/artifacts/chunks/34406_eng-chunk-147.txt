5 Yea, I know that ye know that in 
the body he shall show himself unto 
those  at  Jerusalem,  from  whence 
we came; for it is expedient that it 
should  be  among  them;  for  it  be-
hooveth the great a Creator that he 
b suffereth himself to become c sub-
ject unto man in the flesh, and d die 
for e all men, that all men might be-
come subject unto him.

6 For as a death hath passed upon 
all men, to fulfil the merciful b plan 
of  the  great  Creator,  there  must 
needs be a power of c resurrection, 
and  the  resurrection  must  needs 
come  unto  man  by  reason  of  the 
d fall; and the fall came by reason 
of e transgression; and because man 
became  fallen  they  were  f cut  off 
from the g presence of the Lord.

7 Wherefore,  it  must  needs  be 
an  a infinite  b atonement—save  it 
should be an infinite atonement this
