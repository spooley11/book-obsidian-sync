13 Therefore, according to justice, 
the a plan of b redemption could not 
be  brought  about,  only  on  condi-
tions of repentance of men in this 
probationary state, yea, this prepar-
atory state; for except it were for 
these conditions, mercy could not 
take effect except it should destroy 
the work of justice. Now the work 
of justice could not be destroyed; 
if so, God would c cease to be God.
14 And thus we see that all man-
kind were a fallen, and they were in

the grasp of b justice; yea, the justice 
of God, which consigned them for-
ever to be cut off from his presence.
15 And  now,  the  plan  of  mercy 
could not be brought about except 
an  atonement  should  be  made; 
therefore God himself a atoneth for 
the sins of the world, to bring about 
the plan of b mercy, to appease the 
demands of  c justice, that God might 
be a d perfect, just God, and a e mer-
ciful God also.

16 Now, repentance could not come 
unto men except there were a a pun-
ishment, which also was b eternal as 
the  life  of  the  soul  should  be,  af-
fixed c opposite to the plan of hap-
piness, which was as d eternal also 
as the life of the soul.

17 Now, how could a man repent 
except he should a sin? How could 
he  sin  if  there  was  no  b law?  How 
could there be a law save there was 
a punishment?

18 Now, there was a punishment 
affixed, and a just law given, which 
brought  remorse  of  a conscience 
unto man.

19 Now, if there was no law given—
if a man a murdered he should b die—
would he be afraid he would die if 
he should murder?

20 And also, if there was no law 
given  against  sin  men  would  not 
be afraid to sin.

21 And if there was a no law given, 
if  men  sinned  what  could  justice 
do, or mercy either, for they would 
have no claim upon the creature?

22 But there is a law given, and a
