ways  that  he  did  manifest  things 
unto  the  children  of  men,  which 
were good; and all things which are 
good  cometh  of  Christ;  otherwise 
men were a fallen, and there could 
no good thing come unto them.

MORONI 7  : 25–36

25 Wherefore, by the ministering 
of a angels, and by every word which 
proceeded forth out of the mouth 
of God, men began to exercise faith 
in  Christ;  and  thus  by  faith,  they 
did lay hold upon every good thing; 
and  thus  it  was  until  the  coming 
of Christ.

26 And after that he came men also 
were  a saved by faith in his name; 
and by faith, they become the b sons 
of God. And as surely as Christ liv-
eth he spake these words unto our 
fathers, saying: c Whatsoever thing 
ye shall ask the Father in my name, 
which is good, in faith believing that 
ye shall receive, behold, it shall be 
done unto you.

27 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, have a miracles ceased because 
Christ hath ascended into heaven, 
and hath sat down on the right hand 
of God, to b claim of the Father his 
rights of mercy which he hath upon 
the children of men?
