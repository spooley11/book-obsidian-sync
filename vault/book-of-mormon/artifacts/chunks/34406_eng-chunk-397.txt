4 And  he  also  testified  unto  the 
people that a all mankind should be 
saved at the last day, and that they 
b need not fear nor tremble, but that 
they might lift up their heads and 
rejoice;  for  the  Lord  had  c created 
all men, and had also d redeemed e all  
men; and, in the end, all men should 
have eternal life.

5 And it came to pass that he did 
teach  these  things  so  much  that 
many  did  believe  on  his  words, 
even  so  many  that  they  began  to 
support him and give him a money.

6 And he began to be lifted up in 
the pride of his heart, and to wear 
very costly a apparel, yea, and even 
began to b establish a c church after 
the manner of his preaching.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  as  he  was 
going, to preach to those who be-
lieved on his word, he met a man 
who belonged to the church of God, 
yea,  even  one  of  their  a teachers; 
and he began to contend with him 
sharply,  that  he  might  lead  away 
the people of the church; but the 
man withstood him, admonishing 
him with the b words of God.

8 Now the name of the man was 
a Gideon; and it was he who was an 
instrument in the hands of God in 
delivering the people of Limhi out 
of bondage.

9 Now, because Gideon withstood 
him with the words of God he was 
wroth with Gideon, and drew his 
sword and began to smite him. Now 
Gideon being a stricken with many 
years, therefore he was not able to 
withstand his blows, therefore he 
was b slain by the sword.

10 And the man who slew him was 
taken by the people of the church, 
and  was  brought  before  Alma,  to 
be a judged according to the crimes 
which he had committed.

11 And it came to pass that he stood 
before Alma and pled for himself 
with much boldness.

12 But  Alma  said  unto  him:  Be-
hold,  this  is  the  first  time  that 
a priestcraft  has  been  introduced 
among  this  people.  And  behold, 
thou art not only guilty of priest-
craft,  but  hast  endeavored  to  en-
force  it  by  the  sword;  and  were
