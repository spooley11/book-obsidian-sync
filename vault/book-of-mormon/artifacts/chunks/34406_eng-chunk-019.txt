8 And it came to pass that he called 
the name of the river, Laman, and 
it  emptied  into  the  Red  Sea;  and 
the valley was in the borders near 
the mouth thereof.

9 And  when  my  father  saw  that 
the  waters  of  the  river  emptied 
into the a fountain of the Red Sea, 
he  spake  unto  Laman,  saying:  O 
that thou mightest be like unto this 
river, continually running into the 
fountain of all righteousness!

10 And he also spake unto Lem-
uel:  O  that  thou  mightest  be  like 
unto this valley, a firm and b stead-
fast, and immovable in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord!

11 Now this he spake because of 
the a stiffneckedness of Laman and

Lemuel; for behold they did b mur-
mur in many things against their 
c father, because he was a d visionary 
man, and had led them out of the 
land of Jerusalem, to leave the land 
of their inheritance, and their gold, 
and their silver, and their precious 
things, to perish in the wilderness. 
And this they said he had done be-
cause  of  the  foolish  imaginations 
of his heart.

12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, 
being the eldest, did murmur against 
their a father. And they did b murmur 
because  they  c knew  not  the  deal-
ings of that God who had d created  
them.

13 Neither did they a believe that 
Jerusalem, that great city, could be 
b destroyed according to the words 
of the prophets. And they were like 
unto the Jews who were at Jerusa-
lem, who sought to take away the 
life of my father.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
father did speak unto them in the 
a valley  of  Lemuel,  with  b power, 
being  filled  with  the  Spirit,  until 
their frames did c shake before him. 
And  he  did  confound  them,  that 
they  durst  not  utter  against  him; 
wherefore,  they  did  as  he  com-
manded them.

15 And my father dwelt in a a tent.
16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  being  exceedingly  young, 
nevertheless  being  large  in  stat-
ure, and also having great desires 
to know of the  a mysteries of God,
