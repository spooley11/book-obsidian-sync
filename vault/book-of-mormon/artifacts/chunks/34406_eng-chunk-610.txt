22 Now  this  was  the  covenant 
which  they  made,  and  they  a cast 
their garments at the feet of Moroni, 
saying: We b covenant with our God, 
that we shall be destroyed, even as 
our brethren in the land northward, 
if we shall fall into transgression; 
yea, he may cast us at the feet of 
our enemies, even as we have cast 
our garments at thy feet to be trod-
den under foot, if we shall fall into 
transgression.

23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, 
we are a a remnant of the seed of Ja-
cob; yea, we are a remnant of the 
seed of b Joseph, whose c coat was rent 
by his brethren into many pieces; 
yea, and now behold, let us remem-
ber to keep the commandments of 
God, or our garments shall be rent 
by  our  brethren,  and  we  be  cast 
into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty 
as a a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us 
remember the words of Jacob, be-
fore his death, for behold, he saw 
that a b part of the c remnant of the 
coat of Joseph was d preserved and 
had not decayed. And he said—Even 
as this remnant of garment of my 
son hath been preserved, so shall a 
e remnant of the seed of my son be 
preserved by the hand of God, and 
be taken unto himself, while the re-
mainder of the seed of Joseph shall 
perish, even as the remnant of his  
garment.

25 Now behold, this giveth my soul 
sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath 
joy in my son, because of that part 
of  his  seed  which  shall  be  taken 
unto God.

26 Now behold, this was the lan-

guage of Jacob.

27 And now who knoweth but what 
the remnant of the seed of Joseph, 
which shall perish as his garment, 
are those who have dissented from
