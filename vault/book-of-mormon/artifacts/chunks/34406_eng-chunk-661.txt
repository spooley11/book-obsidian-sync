8 And now behold, I will show unto 
you that we soon accomplished our 
desire; yea, with our strong force, or  
with a part of our strong force, we 
did  surround,  by  night,  the  city 
Cumeni, a little before they were 
to receive a supply of provisions.

9 And it came to pass that we did 
camp round about the city for many 
nights; but we did sleep upon our 
swords, and keep guards, that the 
Lamanites could not come upon us 
by night and slay us, which they at-
tempted many times; but as many 
times as they attempted this their 
blood was spilt.

10 At length their provisions did

arrive, and they were about to enter 
the city by night. And we, instead 
of being Lamanites, were Nephites; 
therefore,  we  did  take  them  and 
their provisions.

11 And  notwithstanding  the  La-
manites  being  cut  off  from  their 
support after this manner, they were  
still  determined  to  maintain  the 
city; therefore it became expedient 
that we should take those provisions 
and send them to aâ€ŠJudea, and our 
prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.
12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days had passed away before 
the Lamanites began to lose all hopes 
of succor; therefore they yielded up  
the city unto our hands; and thus 
we had accomplished our designs 
in obtaining the city Cumeni.

13 But  it  came  to  pass  that  our 
prisoners  were  so  numerous  that, 
notwithstanding  the  enormity  of 
our  numbers,  we  were  obliged  to 
employ all our force to keep them, 
or to put them to death.

14 For behold, they would break 
out  in  great  numbers,  and  would 
fight with stones, and with clubs, 
or whatsoever thing they could get 
into their hands, insomuch that we 
did slay upwards of two thousand 
of them after they had surrendered 
themselves prisoners of war.

15 Therefore it became expedient 
for us, that we should put an end 
to their lives, or guard them, sword 
in hand, down to the land of Zara-
hemla; and also our provisions were 
not  any  more  than  sufficient  for 
our  own  people,  notwithstanding 
that which we had taken from the  
Lamanites.
