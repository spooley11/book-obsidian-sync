3 Behold, I know the place where 
the Lamanites do guard my people 
whom  they  have  taken  prisoners; 
and as Ammoron would not grant 
unto  me  mine  epistle,  behold,  I 
will give unto him according to my 
words; yea, I will seek death among 
them until they shall sue for peace.
4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Moroni had said these words, 
he caused that a search should be 
made among his men, that perhaps 
he might find a man who was a de-
scendant of Laman among them.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
found one, whose name was Laman; 
and  he  was  a one  of  the  servants 
of the king who was murdered by 
Amalickiah.

6 Now Moroni caused that Laman 
and  a  small  number  of  his  men 
should  go  forth  unto  the  guards 
who were over the Nephites.

7 Now the Nephites were guarded 
in the city of  a Gid; therefore Moroni 
appointed Laman and caused that 
a small number of men should go 
with him.

8 And when it was evening Laman 
went to the guards who were over 
the Nephites, and behold, they saw

him coming and they hailed him; 
but he saith unto them: Fear not; 
behold,  I  am  a  Lamanite.  Behold, 
we  have  escaped  from  the  Neph-
ites,  and  they  sleep;  and  behold 
we  have  taken  of  their  wine  and 
brought with us.

9 Now when the Lamanites heard 
these words they received him with 
joy; and they said unto him: Give 
us of your wine, that we may drink; 
we are glad that ye have thus taken 
wine with you for we are weary.

10 But  Laman  said  unto  them: 
Let us keep of our wine till we go 
against the Nephites to battle. But 
this saying only made them more 
desirous to drink of the wine;

11 For,  said  they:  We  are  weary, 
therefore let us take of the wine, and 
by and by we shall receive wine for 
our rations, which will strengthen 
us to go against the Nephites.

12 And Laman said unto them: You 
may do according to your desires.
13 And it came to pass that they 
did take of the wine freely; and it 
was pleasant to their taste, therefore 
they took of it more freely; and it 
was strong, having been prepared 
in its a strength.
