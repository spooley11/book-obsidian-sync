33 And in the days of Com there 
began to be robbers in the land; and 
they adopted the old plans, and ad-
ministered a oaths after the manner 
of the ancients, and sought again 
to destroy the kingdom.

34 Now  Com  did  fight  against 
them  much;  nevertheless,  he  did 
not prevail against them.

CHAPTER 11

Wars,  dissensions,  and  wickedness 
dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict 
the  utter  destruction  of  the  Jaredites 
unless  they  repent—The  people  reject 
the words of the prophets.
And there came also in the days of 
Com many a prophets, and prophe-
sied of the destruction of that great 
people except they should repent, 
and turn unto the Lord, and forsake 
their murders and wickedness.

4 And he lived to a good old age, 
and  begat  Shiblom;  and  Shiblom 
reigned in his stead. And the brother 
of  Shiblom  rebelled  against  him, 
and there began to be an exceed-
ingly great war in all the land.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Shiblom caused that all 
the prophets who prophesied of the 
destruction of the people should be 
put to a death;

6 And there was great calamity in 
all the land, for they had testified 
that a great curse should come upon 
the land, and also upon the people, 
and that there should be a great de-
struction among them, such an one 
as never had been upon the face of 
the earth, and their bones should 
become as a heaps of earth upon the 
face of the land except they should 
repent of their wickedness.

7 And they hearkened not unto the 
voice of the Lord, because of their 
wicked  combinations;  wherefore,  
there began to be wars and a conten-
tions in all the land, and also many  
famines and pestilences, insomuch 
that there was a great destruction, 
such  an  one  as  never  had  been 
known upon the face of the earth; 
and all this came to pass in the days 
of Shiblom.

8 And the people began to repent 
of their iniquity; and inasmuch as 
they did the Lord did have a mercy 
on them.

9 And it came to pass that Shiblom 
was  slain,  and  Seth  was  brought 
into  a captivity,  and  did  dwell  in 
captivity all his days.

10 And it came to pass that Ahah,
