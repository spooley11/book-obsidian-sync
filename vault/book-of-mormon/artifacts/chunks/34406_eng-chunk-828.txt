32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast 
him  out  of  your  a synagogues,  or 
your  places  of  worship,  for  unto 
such shall ye continue to minister; 
for ye know not but what they will 
return and repent, and come unto 
me with full purpose of heart, and 
I shall b heal them; and ye shall be 
the  means  of  bringing  salvation  
unto them.

33 Therefore, keep these sayings 
which I have commanded you that 
ye come not under a condemnation; 
for wo unto him whom the Father 
condemneth.

34 And I give you these command-
ments because of the disputations 
which have been among you. And 
blessed are ye if ye have a no dispu-
tations among you.

35 And now I go unto the Father, 
because it is expedient that I should 
go unto the Father a for your sakes.
36 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of these say-
ings, he touched with his a hand the 
b disciples whom he had chosen, one 
by one, even until he had touched 
them all, and spake unto them as 
he touched them.

37 And  the  multitude  heard  not 
the words which he spake, therefore 
they did not bear record; but the 
disciples bare record that he gave

them a power to give the b Holy Ghost. 
And I will show unto you c hereafter 
that this record is true.

38 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had touched them all, there 
came  a  a cloud  and  overshadowed 
the multitude that they could not 
see Jesus.

39 And while they were overshad-
owed he a departed from them, and 
ascended into heaven. And the dis-
ciples saw and did bear record that 
he ascended again into heaven.

CHAPTER 19
The twelve disciples minister unto the 
people and pray for the Holy Ghost—
The disciples are baptized and receive 
the Holy Ghost and the ministering of 
angels—Jesus prays using words that 
cannot  be  written—He  attests  to  the 
exceedingly great faith of these Neph-
ites. About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  ascended  into  heaven, 
the  multitude  did  disperse,  and  
every man did take his wife and his  
children and did return to his own 
home.
