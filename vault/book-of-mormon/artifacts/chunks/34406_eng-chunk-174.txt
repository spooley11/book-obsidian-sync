6 Let us go up against Judah and 
vex  it,  and  let  us  make  a  breach 
therein for us, and set a king in the 
midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal.
7 Thus saith the Lord God: a It shall 
not stand, neither shall it come to 
pass.

8 For the head of Syria is Damas-
cus,  and  the  head  of  Damascus, 
Rezin; and within threescore and 
five years shall Ephraim be a broken 
that it be not a people.

9 And  the  head  of  Ephraim  is 
Samaria, and the head of Samaria 
is  Remaliah’s  son.  If  ye  will  a not 
believe  surely  ye  shall  not  be  es-
tablished.

10 Moreover, the Lord spake again

unto Ahaz, saying:

11 Ask thee a a sign of the Lord thy 
God; ask it either in the depths, or 
in the heights above.

12 But  Ahaz  said:  I  will  not  ask,

neither will I a tempt the Lord.

13 And  he  said:  Hear  ye  now,  O 
house of David; is it a small thing 
for you to weary men, but will ye 
weary my God also?

14 Therefore, the Lord himself shall 
give you a sign—Behold, a a virgin  
shall conceive, and shall bear a son, 
and shall call his name b Immanuel.
15 Butter and a honey shall he eat, 
that he may know to refuse the evil 
and to choose the good.

16 For a before the child shall know

to  refuse  the  evil  and  choose  the 
good, the land that thou abhorrest 
shall be forsaken of b both her kings.
17 The Lord shall a bring upon thee, 
and upon thy people, and upon thy 
father’s house, days that have not 
come from the day that b Ephraim 
departed from Judah, the king of 
Assyria.

18 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that  day  that  the  Lord  shall  hiss 
for the fly that is in the uttermost 
part of Egypt, and for the bee that 
is in the land of Assyria.

19 And they shall come, and shall 
rest all of them in the desolate val-
leys, and in the holes of the rocks, 
and upon all thorns, and upon all 
bushes.
