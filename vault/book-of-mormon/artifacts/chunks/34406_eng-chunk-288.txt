9 And these are the words which 
he a spake and caused to be written, 
saying: My brethren, all ye that have 
assembled yourselves together, you 
that  can  hear  my  words  which  I 
shall speak unto you this day; for I 
have not commanded you to come  
up hither to b trifle with the words 
which  I  shall  speak,  but  that  you 
should c hearken unto me, and open 
your ears that ye may hear, and your 
d hearts that ye may understand, and 
your e minds that the f mysteries of 
God may be unfolded to your view.
10 I have not commanded you to 
come up hither that ye should fear 
a me, or that ye should think that I of 
myself am more than a mortal man.
11 But  I  am  like  as  yourselves, 
subject to all manner of infirmities 
in body and mind; yet I have been 
chosen by this people, and a conse-
crated by b my father, and was suf-
fered by the hand of the Lord that 
I should be a ruler and a king over 
this people; and have been kept and 
preserved by his matchless power, to

serve you with all the might, mind 
and strength which the Lord hath 
granted unto me.

12 I  say  unto  you  that  as  I  have 
been suffered to a spend my days in 
your service, even up to this time, 
and have not sought b gold nor silver 
nor any manner of riches of you;

13 Neither have I suffered that ye 
should  be  confined  in  dungeons, 
nor that ye should make slaves one 
of another, nor that ye should mur-
der, or plunder, or steal, or commit 
adultery; nor even have I suffered 
that ye should commit any manner 
of wickedness, and have taught you 
that ye should keep the command-
ments  of  the  Lord,  in  all  things 
which he hath commanded you—
14 And  even  I,  myself,  have  a la-
bored with mine own b hands that I 
might serve you, and that ye should 
not be c laden with taxes, and that 
there should nothing come upon you 
which was grievous to be borne—
and of all these things which I have 
spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses 
this day.
