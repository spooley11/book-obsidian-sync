43 And  behold  this  last,  whose 
branch hath withered away, I did 
plant in a a good spot of ground; yea, 
even that which was choice unto me 
above all other parts of the land of 
my vineyard.

44 And thou beheldest that I also 
cut  down  that  which  a cumbered 
this  spot  of  ground,  that  I  might 
plant this tree in the stead thereof.
45 And thou beheldest that a a part 
thereof  brought  forth  good  fruit, 
and  a  part  thereof  brought  forth 
wild fruit; and because I plucked 
not the branches thereof and cast 
them into the fire, behold, they have 
overcome the good branch that it 
hath withered away.

46 And now, behold, notwithstand-
ing all the care which we have taken 
of  my  vineyard,  the  trees  thereof 
have become corrupted, that they

bring forth no good a fruit; and these 
I had hoped to preserve, to have laid 
up fruit thereof against the season, 
unto  mine  own  self.  But,  behold, 
they  have  become  like  unto  the 
wild olive tree, and they are of no 
worth but to be  b hewn down and 
cast  into  the  fire;  and  it  grieveth 
me that I should lose them.

47 But  a what  could  I  have  done 
more in my vineyard? Have I slack-
ened  mine  hand,  that  I  have  not 
nourished it? Nay, I have nourished 
it, and I have digged about it, and I 
have pruned it, and I have dunged 
it; and I have b stretched forth mine 
c hand almost all the day long, and 
the d end draweth nigh. And it griev-
eth me that I should hew down all 
the trees of my vineyard, and cast 
them into the fire that they should 
be burned. Who is it that has cor-
rupted my vineyard?

48 And it came to pass that the ser-
vant said unto his master: Is it not 
the a loftiness of thy vineyard—have 
not the branches thereof overcome 
the roots which are good? And be-
cause the branches have overcome 
the roots thereof, behold they grew 
faster than the strength of the roots, 
b taking strength unto themselves. 
Behold, I say, is not this the cause 
that the trees of thy vineyard have 
become corrupted?
