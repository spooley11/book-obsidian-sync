1 NEPHI 2  : 17–3  : 5

wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; 
and  behold  he  did  b visit  me,  and 
did c soften my heart that I did d be-
lieve all the words which had been 
spoken by my e father; wherefore, I 
did not f rebel against him like unto 
my brothers.

17 And I spake unto Sam, making 
known unto him the things which 
the Lord had manifested unto me 
by his Holy Spirit. And it came to 
pass that he believed in my words.
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel 
would not hearken unto my words; 
and being a grieved because of the 
hardness of their hearts I cried unto 
the Lord for them.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed 
art  thou,  Nephi,  because  of  thy 
a faith,  for  thou  hast  sought  me 
diligently, with lowliness of heart.
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep 
my commandments, ye shall a pros-
per, and shall be led to a b land of 
promise; yea, even a land which I 
have prepared for you; yea, a land 
which  is  choice  above  all  other 
lands.

21 And inasmuch as thy brethren 
shall rebel against thee, they shall 
be  a cut  off  from  the  presence  of 
the Lord.
