a led away from time to time from 
the house of Israel, according to his 
will and pleasure. And now behold, 
the Lord remembereth all them who 
have been broken off, wherefore he 
remembereth us also.

23 Therefore, a cheer up your hearts, 
and remember that ye are b free to 
c act for yourselves—to d choose the 
way of everlasting death or the way 
of eternal life.

24 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren,  a reconcile  yourselves  to  the 
b will of God, and not to the will of 
the devil and the flesh; and remem-
ber,  after  ye  are  reconciled  unto 
God, that it is only in and through 
the c grace of God that ye are d saved.
25 Wherefore, may God a raise you 
from death by the power of the res-
urrection, and also from everlasting 
death by the power of the b atone-
ment, that ye may be received into 
the c eternal kingdom of God, that 
ye may praise him through grace 
divine. Amen.

CHAPTER 11

Jacob saw his Redeemer—The law of 
Moses  typifies  Christ  and  proves  He 
will come. About 559–545 b.c.
And now, a Jacob spake many more 
things to my people at that time; 
nevertheless only these things have I 
caused to be b written, for the things 
which I have written sufficeth me.

2 And now I, Nephi, write a more 
of the words of b Isaiah, for my soul 
delighteth in his words. For I will 
liken  his  words  unto  my  people, 
and  I  will  send  them  forth  unto 
all my children, for he verily c saw 
my d Redeemer, even as I have seen  
him.

3 And  my  brother,  Jacob,  also 
has  a seen him as I have seen him; 
wherefore, I will send their words 
forth  unto  my  children  to  prove 
unto them that my words are true. 
Wherefore, by the words of b three, 
God hath said, I will establish my 
word.  Nevertheless,  God  sendeth 
more  c witnesses,  and  he  proveth 
all his words.

4 Behold,  my  soul  delighteth  in 
a proving unto my people the truth 
of  the  b coming  of  Christ;  for,  for 
this  end  hath  the  c law  of  Moses 
been  given;  and  all  things  which 
have  been  given  of  God  from  the 
beginning of the world, unto man, 
are the d typifying of him.
