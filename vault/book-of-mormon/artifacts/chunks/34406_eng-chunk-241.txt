JACOB 3  : 8–4  : 3

how much better are you than they, 
in the sight of your great Creator?
8 O my brethren, I fear that unless 
ye shall repent of your sins that their 
skins  will  be  a whiter  than  yours, 
when ye shall be brought with them 
before the throne of God.

9 Wherefore,  a  commandment  I 
give  unto  you,  which  is  the  word 
of  God,  that  ye  a revile  no  more 
against them because of the dark-
ness of their skins; neither shall ye 
revile against them because of their 
filthi ness;  but  ye  shall  remember 
your own filthiness, and remember 
that their filthiness came because 
of their fathers.

10 Wherefore, ye shall remember 
your  a children,  how  that  ye  have 
grieved their hearts because of the 
b example  that  ye  have  set  before 
them; and also, remember that ye 
may,  because  of  your  filthiness, 
bring your children unto destruc-
tion, and their sins be heaped upon 
your heads at the last day.

11 O my brethren, hearken unto 
my words; a arouse the faculties of 
your  souls;  shake  yourselves  that 
ye  may  b awake  from  the  slumber 
of death; and loose yourselves from 
the pains of c hell that ye may not 
become d angels to the devil, to be 
cast into that lake of fire and brim-
stone which is the second e death.
