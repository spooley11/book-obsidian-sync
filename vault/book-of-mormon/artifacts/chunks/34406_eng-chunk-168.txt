comely  to  them  that  are  escaped 
of Israel.

3 And it shall come to pass, they 
that are a left in Zion and remain in 
Jerusalem shall be called holy, ev-
ery one that is written among the 
living in Jerusalem—

4 When the Lord shall have a washed 
away the filth of the daughters of 
Zion,  and  shall  have  purged  the 
blood of Jerusalem from the midst 
thereof by the spirit of judgment 
and by the spirit of b burning.

5 And the a Lord will create upon 
every dwelling-place of mount Zion,  
and upon her assemblies, a b cloud 
and smoke by day and the shining of  
a flaming fire by night; for upon all 
the glory of Zion shall be a defence.
6 And there shall be a tabernacle 
for a shadow in the daytime from the  
heat, and for a place of a refuge, and 
a covert from storm and from rain.

CHAPTER 15
The  Lord’s  vineyard  (Israel)  will  be-
come  desolate,  and  His  people  will 
be  scattered—Woes  will  come  upon 
them  in  their  apostate  and  scattered 
state—The  Lord  will  lift  an  ensign 
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 5. 
About 559–545 b.c.
a And then will I sing to my well- 
beloved a song of my beloved, touch-
ing his b vineyard. My well-beloved  
hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.
2 And he fenced it, and gathered 
out the stones thereof, and planted 
it with the choicest a vine, and built 
a tower in the midst of it, and also 
made a wine-press therein; and he 
looked  that  it  should  bring  forth 
grapes,  and  it  brought  forth  wild 
grapes.

3 And  now,  O  inhabitants  of  
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, 
I  pray  you,  betwixt  me  and  my 
vineyard.
