22 And thus it became the desire of 
the people of Zemnarihah to with-
draw from their design, because of 
the great destruction which came 
upon them by night and by day.

23 And it came to pass that Zem-
narihah did give command unto his 
people that they should withdraw 
themselves  from  the  siege,  and 
march into the furthermost parts 
of the land northward.

24 And  now,  Gidgiddoni  being 
aware of their design, and knowing 
of  their  weakness  because  of  the 
want of food, and the great slaugh-
ter  which  had  been  made  among 
them, therefore he did send out his 
armies in the night-time, and did 
cut off the way of their retreat, and 
did place his armies in the way of 
their retreat.

25 And  this  did  they  do  in  the 
night-time, and got on their march 
beyond the robbers, so that on the 
morrow,  when  the  robbers  began 
their march, they were met by the 
armies of the Nephites both in their 
front and in their rear.

26 And the robbers who were on 
the south were also cut off in their

places  of  retreat.  And  all  these 
things were done by command of 
Gidgiddoni.

27 And  there  were  many  thou-
sands who did yield themselves up 
prisoners  unto  the  Nephites,  and 
the remainder of them were slain.
28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, 
was taken and hanged upon a tree, 
yea, even upon the top thereof un-
til  he  was  dead.  And  when  they 
had hanged him until he was dead 
they did fell the tree to the earth, 
and  did  cry  with  a  loud  voice,  
saying:

29 May the Lord preserve his peo-
ple in righteousness and in holiness 
of heart, that they may cause to be 
felled to the earth all who shall seek 
to slay them because of power and 
secret  combinations,  even  as  this 
man hath been felled to the earth.
30 And they did rejoice and cry 
again with one voice, saying: May 
the a God of Abraham, and the God 
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, pro-
tect this people in righteousness, so 
long as they shall b call on the name 
of their God for c protection.
