19 And because of the a knowledge 
of this man he could not be kept 
from beholding within the b veil; and 
he saw the finger of Jesus, which, 
when he saw, he fell with fear; for 
he knew that it was the finger of 
the Lord; and he had c faith no lon-
ger, for he knew, nothing d doubting.
20 Wherefore, having this perfect 
knowledge of God, he could a not be 
kept from within the veil; therefore 
he b saw Jesus; and he did minister 
unto him.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord said unto the brother of Jared: 
Behold, thou shalt not suffer these 
things which ye have seen and heard 
to go forth unto the world, until the 
a time cometh that I shall glorify my 
name  in  the  flesh;  wherefore,  ye 
shall b treasure up the things which 
ye have seen and heard, and show 
it to no man.

22 And behold, when ye shall come 
unto me, ye shall write them and 
shall seal them up, that no one can 
interpret them; for ye shall write 
them in a a language that they can-
not be read.

23 And behold, these a two stones 
will I give unto thee, and ye shall 
seal them up also with the things 
which ye shall write.
