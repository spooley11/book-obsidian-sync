had supposed, because of the great-
ness  of  their  numbers,  yea,  they 
supposed that they should be privi-
leged to come upon them as they 
had hitherto done; yea, and they had  
also  prepared  themselves  with 
shields,  and  with  a breastplates; 
and they had also prepared them-
selves with garments of skins, yea, 
very thick garments to cover their  
nakedness.

7 And  being  thus  prepared  they 
supposed  that  they  should  easily 
overpower and a subject their breth-
ren to the yoke of bondage, or slay 
and  massacre  them  according  to 
their pleasure.

8 But  behold,  to  their  uttermost 
astonishment, they were a prepared 
for them, in a manner which never 
had  been  known  among  the  chil-
dren of Lehi. Now they were pre-
pared for the Lamanites, to battle 
after the manner of the instructions  
of Moroni.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, 
were  exceedingly  astonished  at 
their  manner  of  preparation  for  
war.

10 Now,  if  king  Amalickiah  had 
come down out of the a land of Nephi, 
at  the  head  of  his  army,  perhaps 
he would have caused the Laman-
ites to have attacked the Nephites 
at the city of Ammonihah; for be-
hold, he did care not for the blood 
of his people.

11 But behold, Amalickiah did not 
come down himself to battle. And 
behold,  his  chief  captains  durst 
not attack the Nephites at the city 
of  Ammonihah,  for  Moroni  had 
altered the management of affairs 
among the Nephites, insomuch that 
the  Lamanites  were  disappointed 
in their places of retreat and they 
could not come upon them.

12 Therefore  they  retreated  into 
the wilderness, and took their camp

and marched towards the land of 
a Noah,  supposing  that  to  be  the 
next best place for them to come 
against the Nephites.

13 For they knew not that Moroni 
had  fortified,  or  had  built  a forts  
of security, for every city in all the 
land round about; therefore, they 
marched  forward  to  the  land  of 
Noah  with  a  firm  determination; 
yea, their chief captains came for-
ward and took an  b oath that they 
would  destroy  the  people  of  that 
city.

14 But behold, to their astonish-
ment, the city of Noah, which had 
hitherto  been  a  weak  place,  had 
now, by the means of Moroni, be-
come strong, yea, even to exceed the 
strength of the city Ammonihah.
