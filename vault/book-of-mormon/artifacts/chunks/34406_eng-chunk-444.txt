24 And now it came to pass that 
the people were more angry with 
Amulek, and they cried out, saying: 
This  man  doth  revile  against  our 
laws which are just, and our wise 
a lawyers whom we have selected.

25 But  Amulek  stretched  forth 
his  hand,  and  cried  the  mightier 
unto them, saying: O ye wicked and

perverse generation, why hath Sa-
tan got such great hold upon your 
hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves 
unto him that he may have power 
over you, to a blind your eyes, that 
ye will not understand the words 
which  are  spoken,  according  to  
their truth?

26 For  behold,  have  I  testified 
against  your  law?  Ye  do  not  un-
derstand; ye say that I have spoken 
against  your  law;  but  I  have  not, 
but I have spoken in favor of your 
law, to your condemnation.

27 And now behold, I say unto you, 
that the foundation of the a destruc-
tion of this people is beginning to 
be laid by the b unrighteousness of 
your c lawyers and your judges.

28 And now it came to pass that 
when  Amulek  had  spoken  these 
words the people cried out against 
him, saying: Now we know that this 
man is a a child of the devil, for he 
hath b lied unto us; for he hath spo-
ken against our law. And now he says  
that he has not spoken against it.

29 And  again,  he  has  reviled 
against our lawyers, and our judges.
30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
lawyers put it into their hearts that 
they should remember these things 
against him.
