5 And  whosoever  will  hearken 
unto my words and repenteth and 
is baptized, the same shall be saved. 
Search the a prophets, for many there 
be that testify of these things.

6 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Jesus had said these words he 
said unto them again, after he had 
expounded all the scriptures unto 
them which they had received, he 
said unto them: Behold, other scrip-
tures I would that ye should write, 
that ye have not.

7 And it came to pass that he said 
unto a Nephi: Bring forth the record 
which ye have kept.

8 And  when  Nephi  had  brought 
forth  the  records,  and  laid  them 
before him, he cast his eyes upon 
them and said:

9 Verily  I  say  unto  you,  I  com-
manded  my  servant  a Samuel,  the 
Lamanite,  that  he  should  testify 
unto  this  people,  that  at  the  day 
that the Father should glorify his 
name in me that there were b many 
c saints who should d arise from the 
dead, and should appear unto many, 
and  should  minister  unto  them. 
And  he  said  unto  them:  Was  it  
not so?

10 And his disciples answered him 
and  said:  Yea,  Lord,  Samuel  did 
prophesy according to thy words, 
and they were all fulfilled.

11 And Jesus said unto them: How

be it that ye have not a written this 
thing, that many  b saints did arise 
and  appear  unto  many  and  did 
minister unto them?

12 And it came to pass that Nephi 
remembered that this thing had not 
been written.

13 And it came to pass that Jesus 
commanded that it should be a writ-
ten; therefore it was written accord-
ing as he commanded.

14 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had a expounded all the 
scriptures in one, which they had 
written, he commanded them that 
they should b teach the things which 
he had expounded unto them.
