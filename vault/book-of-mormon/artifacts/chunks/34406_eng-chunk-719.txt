4 And seeing the people in a state 
of  such  awful  wickedness,  and 
those Gadianton robbers filling the  
judgment-seats—having  a usurped 
the power and authority of the land; 
laying  aside  the  commandments 
of God, and not in the least aright 
before him; doing no justice unto 
the children of men;

5 Condemning  the  righteous  be-
cause of their righteousness; letting 
the guilty and the wicked go a un-
punished because of their b money; 
and moreover to be held in office 
at the head of government, to rule 
and  do  according  to  their  wills, 
that they might get gain and glory 
of the  c world, and, moreover, that 
they might the more easily commit 
adultery,  and  steal,  and  kill,  and 
do according to their own wills—

6 Now this great iniquity had come 
upon the Nephites, in the space of 
a not many years; and when Nephi 
saw it, his heart was swollen with 
sorrow within his breast; and he did 
exclaim in the agony of his soul:

HELAMAN 7  : 7–22

7 Oh,  that  I  could  have  had  my 
days  in  the  days  when  my  father 
Nephi first came out of the land of 
Jerusalem, that I could have a joyed 
with him in the promised land; then 
were his people easy to be entreated, 
b firm to keep the commandments  
of God, and slow to be led to do iniq-
uity; and they were quick to hearken 
unto the words of the Lord—

8 Yea, if my days could have been 
in those days, then would my soul 
have had joy in the righteousness 
of my brethren.
