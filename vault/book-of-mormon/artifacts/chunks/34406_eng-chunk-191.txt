16 They  that  see  thee  shall  nar-
rowly  look  upon  thee,  and  shall 
consider thee, and shall say: Is this 
the  man  that  made  the  earth  to 
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?
17 And made the world as a wil-
derness,  and  destroyed  the  cities 
thereof, and opened not the house 
of his prisoners?

18 All the kings of the nations, yea, 
all of them, lie in glory, every one 
of them in his own house.

19 But  thou  art  cast  out  of  thy 
grave like an abominable branch, 
and the remnant of those that are 
slain, thrust through with a sword, 
that go down to the stones of the 
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
20 Thou shalt not be joined with 
them in burial, because thou hast 
destroyed  thy  land  and  slain  thy 
people;  the  a seed  of  b evil-doers  
shall never be renowned.

21 Prepare slaughter for his chil-
dren  for  the  a iniquities  of  their 
fathers, that they do not rise, nor 
possess  the  land,  nor  fill  the  face 
of the world with cities.

22 For I will rise up against them, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off 
from Babylon the a name, and rem-
nant, and son, and b nephew, saith 
the Lord.

23 I will also make it a a possession 
for the bittern, and pools of water; 
and I will sweep it with the besom of 
destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.
24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, 
saying: Surely as I have thought, so

shall it come to pass; and as I have 
purposed, so shall it stand—

25 That I will bring the Assyrian in 
my land, and upon my mountains 
tread him under foot; then shall his 
a yoke  depart  from  off  them,  and 
his  burden  depart  from  off  their 
shoulders.

26 This is the purpose that is pur-
posed  upon  the  whole  earth;  and 
this  is  the  hand  that  is  stretched 
out upon all nations.

27 For the Lord of Hosts hath pur-
posed, and who shall disannul? And 
his hand is stretched out, and who 
shall turn it back?

28 In the year that king  a Ahaz died

was this burden.
