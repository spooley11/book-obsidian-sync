8 a Listen  to  the  words  of  Christ, 
your  Redeemer,  your  Lord  and 
your God. Behold, I came into the 
world not to call the righteous but 
sinners to repentance; the  b whole 
need no physician, but they that are  
sick; wherefore, little c children are 
d whole,  for  they  are  not  capable 
of committing e sin; wherefore the 
curse of f Adam is taken from them 
in me, that it hath no power over 
them; and the law of g circumcision 
is done away in me.

9 And after this manner did the 
Holy  Ghost  manifest  the  word  of 
God  unto  me;  wherefore,  my  be-
loved son, I know that it is solemn 
a mockery before God, that ye should 
baptize little children.

10 Behold I say unto you that this 
thing  shall  ye  teach—repentance 
and  baptism  unto  those  who  are 
a accountable and capable of com-
mitting sin; yea, teach parents that 
they must repent and be baptized, 
and  humble  themselves  as  their 
little  b children, and they shall all 
be saved with their little children.
11 And their little a children need 
no repentance, neither baptism. Be-
hold, baptism is unto repentance to 
the  fulfilling  the  commandments 
unto the b remission of sins.

12 But little a children are alive in 
Christ, even from the foundation of 
the world; if not so, God is a partial

God,  and  also  a  changeable  God, 
and  a  b respecter  to  persons;  for 
how many little children have died 
without baptism!

13 Wherefore,  if  little  children 
could  not  be  saved  without  bap-
tism,  these  must  have  gone  to  an 
endless hell.
