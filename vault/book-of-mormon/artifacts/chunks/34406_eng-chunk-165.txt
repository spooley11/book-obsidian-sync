17 And the loftiness of man shall 
be bowed down, and the a haughti-
ness of men shall be made low; and 
the Lord alone shall be exalted in 
b that day.

18 And the idols he shall utterly

abolish.

19 And they shall go into the holes 
of the rocks, and into the caves of the 
earth, for the fear of the Lord shall 
come upon them and the a glory of his  
majesty shall smite them, when he 
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
20 In  that  day  a  man  shall  cast 
his idols of silver, and his idols of 
gold, which he hath made for him-
self to worship, to the moles and to  
the bats;

21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, 
and into the tops of the ragged rocks, 
for the fear of the Lord shall come 
upon them and the majesty of his 
glory  shall  smite  them,  when  he 
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
22 Cease  ye  from  man,  whose

breath is in his nostrils; for wherein 
is he to be accounted of?

CHAPTER 13

Judah and Jerusalem will be punished 
for their disobedience—The Lord pleads 
for and judges His people—The daugh-
ters of Zion are cursed and tormented 
for their worldliness—Compare Isaiah 
3. About 559–545 b.c.
a For behold, the Lord, the Lord of 
Hosts, doth take away from Jerusa-
lem, and from Judah, the stay and 
the staff, the whole staff of bread, 
and the whole stay of water—

2 The a mighty man, and the man 
of b war, the judge, and the prophet, 
and the c prudent, and the ancient;
3 The  captain  of  fifty,  and  the 
honorable man, and the counselor, 
and the cunning artificer, and the 
eloquent orator.

4 And  I  will  give  children  unto 
them to be their princes, and babes 
shall rule over them.

5 And  the  people  shall  be  a op-
pressed,  every  one  by  another, 
and every one by his neighbor; the 
child shall behave himself b proudly 
against  the  ancient,  and  the  base 
against the honorable.

6 When a man shall take hold of his 
brother of the house of his father, 
and shall say: Thou hast clothing, 
be thou our ruler, and let not this 
a ruin come under thy hand—
