27 But behold, the Lamanites were 
not frightened according to his de-
sire,  but  they  had  come  into  the 
center of the land, and had taken 
the capital city which was the city 
of Zarahemla, and were marching 
through the most capital parts of 
the land, slaying the people with a 
great slaughter, both men, women, 
and children, taking possession of 
many cities and of many strongholds.
28 But when Moronihah had dis-
covered this, he immediately sent 
forth Lehi with an army round about 
to  a head them before they should 
come to the land Bountiful.

29 And  thus  he  did;  and  he  did 
head them before they came to the 
land Bountiful, and gave unto them 
battle,  insomuch  that  they  began 
to  retreat  back  towards  the  land 
of Zarahemla.

30 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah did head them in their retreat, 
and did give unto them battle, in-
somuch that it became an exceed-
ingly bloody battle; yea, many were 
slain, and among the number who 
were  slain  a Coriantumr  was  also  
found.

31 And now, behold, the Lamanites  
could not retreat either way, neither 
on the north, nor on the south, nor on  
the east, nor on the west, for they 
were surrounded on every hand by 
the Nephites.

32 And  thus  had  Coriantumr 
plunged  the  Lamanites  into  the 
midst  of  the  Nephites,  insomuch 
that they were in the power of the  
Nephites, and he himself was slain, 
and the Lamanites did a yield them-
selves into the hands of the Nephites.

33 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah took possession of the city of 
Zarahemla again, and caused that 
the Lamanites who had been taken 
prisoners should depart out of the 
land in a peace.

34 And thus ended the forty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.
