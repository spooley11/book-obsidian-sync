The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal 
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His res-
urrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of 
salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and 
eternal salvation in the life to come.

After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his 
son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in 
the Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glo-
rified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and in-
structed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation 
into the English language.

In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated 
them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many 
languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of 
the living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws 
and ordinances of His gospel may be saved.

Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I told the breth-
ren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, 
and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by 
abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”

In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see 
the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and 
divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included 
herewith as “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” and “The Testimony of 
Eight Witnesses.”

We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder 
in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal 
Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this 
course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by 
the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3–5.)
