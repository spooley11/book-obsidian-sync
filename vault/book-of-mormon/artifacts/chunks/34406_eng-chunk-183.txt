24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord 
God  of  Hosts:  O  my  people  that 
dwellest in Zion, a be not afraid of 
the  Assyrian;  he  shall  smite  thee 
with  a  rod,  and  shall  lift  up  his 
staff against thee, after the  b man-
ner of Egypt.

25 For yet a very little while, and 
the  a indignation  shall  cease,  and 
mine anger in their destruction.

26 And the Lord of Hosts shall a stir 
up a scourge for him according to 
the slaughter of b Midian at the rock 
of Oreb; and as his rod was upon 
the sea so shall he lift it up after 
the manner of c Egypt.

27 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in

taken away from off thy shoulder, 
and his yoke from off thy neck, and 
the yoke shall be destroyed because 
of the b anointing.

Laish, O poor b Anathoth.

habitants  of  Gebim  gather  them-
selves to flee.
