Lord began to bless them, insomuch 
that  they  brought  many  to  the 
knowledge of the truth; yea, they  
did  a convince many of their sins, 
and of the traditions of their fathers, 
which were not correct.

18 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  Lamoni  returned  from 
the  land  of  Middoni  to  the  land  
of a Ishmael, which was the land of 
their inheritance.

19 And  king  Lamoni  would  not 
suffer  that  Ammon  should  serve 
him, or be his a servant.

20 But he caused that there should 
be  a synagogues  built  in  the  land 
of Ishmael; and he caused that his 
people,  or  the  people  who  were 
under  his  reign,  should  assemble 
themselves together.

21 And he did rejoice over them, 
and he did teach them many things. 
And he did also declare unto them 
that they were a people who were 
under  him,  and  that  they  were  a 
a free  people,  that  they  were  free 
from the oppressions of the king, 
his father; for that his father had 
granted  unto  him  that  he  might 
reign over the people who were in 
the land of Ishmael, and in all the 
land round about.

22 And he also declared unto them 
that  they  might  have  the  a liberty 
of worshiping the Lord their God 
according to their desires, in what-
soever place they were in, if it were 
in  the  land  which  was  under  the 
reign of king Lamoni.

23 And Ammon did preach unto 
the  people  of  king  Lamoni;  and 
it  came  to  pass  that  he  did  teach 
them all things concerning things 
pertaining  to  righteousness.  And 
he did exhort them daily, with all 
diligence; and they gave heed unto 
his word, and they were a zealous for 
keeping the commandments of God.
