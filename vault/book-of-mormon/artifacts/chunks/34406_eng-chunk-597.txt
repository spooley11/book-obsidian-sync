36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites, when they saw the Neph-
ites  coming  upon  them  in  their 
rear, turned them about and began 
to contend with the army of Lehi.
37 And  the  work  of  death  com-
menced  on  both  sides,  but  it  was 
more  dreadful  on  the  part  of  the 
Lamanites,  for  their  a nakedness 
was  exposed  to  the  heavy  blows 
of the Nephites with their swords 
and their cimeters, which brought 
death almost at every stroke.

38 While on the other hand, there 
was now and then a man fell among 
the Nephites, by their swords and  
the loss of blood, they being shielded 
from  the  more  vital  parts  of  the 
body,  or  the  more  vital  parts  of 
the body being shielded from the 
strokes of the Lamanites, by their 
a breastplates, and their armshields, 
and their head-plates; and thus the 
Nephites did carry on the work of 
death among the Lamanites.

39 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites became frightened, be-
cause of the great destruction among 
them, even until they began to flee 
towards the river Sidon.

40 And they were pursued by Lehi 
and his men; and they were driven 
by  Lehi  into  the  waters  of  Sidon, 
and they crossed the waters of Si-
don. And Lehi retained his armies 
upon the bank of the river Sidon 
that they should not cross.

41 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and his army met the Lamanites in 
the a valley, on the other side of the 
river Sidon, and began to fall upon 
them and to slay them.

42 And  the  Lamanites  did  flee 
again before them, towards the land 
of Manti; and they were met again 
by the armies of Moroni.

43 Now in this case the Lamanites 
did  fight  exceedingly;  yea,  never 
had the Lamanites been known to 
fight with such exceedingly great 
strength and courage, no, not even 
from the beginning.
