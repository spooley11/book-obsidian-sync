8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  did 
deliver the plates unto my brother 
Chemish.

9 Now I, Chemish, write what few 
things I write, in the same book with 
my brother; for behold, I saw the 
last which he wrote, that he wrote it  
with his own hand; and he wrote  
it in the day that he delivered them 
unto me. And after this manner we 
keep the a records, for it is accord-
ing  to  the  commandments  of  our 
fathers. And I make an end.

10 Behold,  I,  Abinadom,  am  the 
son  of  Chemish.  Behold,  it  came 
to  pass  that  I  saw  much  war  and 
contention between my people, the 
Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, 
with my own sword, have taken the 
lives of many of the Lamanites in 
the defence of my brethren.

11 And behold, the a record of this 
people  is  engraven  upon  plates 
which is had by the b kings, accord-
ing to the generations; and I know 
of  no  revelation  save  that  which 
has been written, neither prophecy; 
wherefore, that which is sufficient 
is written. And I make an end.

12 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of 
Abinadom. Behold, I will speak unto 
you somewhat concerning a Mosiah, 
who was made king over the b land 
of Zarahemla; for behold, he being 
c warned of the Lord that he should

d flee out of the e land of f  Nephi, and 
as many as would hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord should also  g de-
part out of the land with him, into 
the wilderness—

13 And it came to pass that he did 
according  as  the  Lord  had  com-
manded  him.  And  they  departed 
out of the land into the wilderness, 
as many as would hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord; and they were led 
by  many  preachings  and  prophe-
syings. And they were admonished 
continually by the word of God; and 
they were led by the power of his 
a arm, through the wilderness until 
they came down into the land which 
is called the b land of Zarahemla.
