28 And  they  shall  be  a  a scourge 
unto the people of this land. Nev-
ertheless,  when  they  shall  have 
received the fulness of my gospel, 
then if they shall harden their hearts 
against me I will return their b iniqui-
ties upon their own heads, saith the  
Father.

29 And I will a remember the cov-
enant which I have made with my 
people; and I have covenanted with 
them  that  I  would  b gather  them 
together  in  mine  own  due  time, 
that I would give unto them again 
the c land of their fathers for their 
inheritance,  which  is  the  land  of 
Jerusalem, which is the promised 
land  unto  them  forever,  saith  the  
Father.

30 And it shall come to pass that 
the time cometh, when the fulness 
of  my  gospel  shall  be  preached 
unto them;

31 And they shall a believe in me, 
that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, and shall pray unto the Father 
in my name.

32 Then shall their a watchmen lift 
up their voice, and with the voice 
together  shall  they  sing;  for  they 
shall see eye to eye.

33 Then  will  the  Father  gather 
them together again, and give unto 
them  a Jerusalem  for  the  b land  of 
their inheritance.

34 Then  shall  they  break  forth 
into joy—a Sing together, ye waste

places of Jerusalem; for the Father 
hath comforted his people, he hath 
redeemed Jerusalem.

35 The Father hath made bare his 
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of the Father; 
and the Father and I are one.

36 And then shall be brought to  
pass that which is written: a Awake, 
awake again, and put on thy strength, 
O Zion; put on thy beautiful gar-
ments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, 
for henceforth there shall no more 
come into thee the uncircumcised 
and the unclean.

37 Shake  thyself  from  the  dust; 
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose 
thyself from the bands of thy neck, 
O captive daughter of Zion.

38 For  thus  saith  the  Lord:  Ye 
have  sold  yourselves  for  naught, 
and ye shall be redeemed without  
money.
