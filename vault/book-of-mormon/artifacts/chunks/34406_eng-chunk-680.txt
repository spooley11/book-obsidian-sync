Moroni marches to the aid of Pahoran 
in the land of Gideon—The king-men 
who refuse to defend their country are 
put to death—Pahoran and Moroni re-
take Nephihah—Many Lamanites join 
the people of Ammon—Teancum slays 
Ammoron  and  is  in  turn  slain—The 
Lamanites  are  driven  from  the  land, 
and  peace  is  established—Helaman 
returns to the ministry and builds up 
the Church. About 62–57 b.c.
And now it came to pass that when 
Moroni  had  received  this  epistle 
his heart did take courage, and was  
filled with exceedingly great joy be-
cause of the faithfulness of Pahoran,  
that he was not also a a traitor to the 
freedom and cause of his country.
2 But he did also mourn exceed-
ingly because of the iniquity of those  
who had driven Pahoran from the 
judgment-seat, yea, in fine because 
of those who had rebelled against 
their country and also their God.

3 And it came to pass that Moroni 
took  a  small  number  of  men,  ac-
cording  to  the  desire  of  Pahoran, 
and gave Lehi and Teancum com-
mand  over  the  remainder  of  his 
army, and took his march towards 
the land of Gideon.

4 And he did raise the a standard 
of b liberty in whatsoever place he 
did enter, and gained whatsoever 
force he could in all his march to-
wards the land of Gideon.

5 And it came to pass that thou-
sands did a flock unto his standard, 
and did take up their swords in the 
defence of their freedom, that they 
might not come into bondage.

6 And  thus,  when  Moroni  had  
gathered together whatsoever men 
he could in all his march, he came  
to the land of Gideon; and uniting 
his  forces  with  those  of  Pahoran 
they  became  exceedingly  strong, 
even  stronger  than  the  men  of

Pachus, who was the a king of those 
dissenters  who  had  driven  the  
b freemen out of the land of Zara-
hemla  and  had  taken  possession 
of the land.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni and Pahoran went down with 
their armies into the land of Zara-
hemla, and went forth against the 
city, and did meet the men of Pa-
chus, insomuch that they did come  
to battle.

8 And  behold,  Pachus  was  slain 
and his men were taken prisoners, 
and  Pahoran  was  restored  to  his 
judgment-seat.
