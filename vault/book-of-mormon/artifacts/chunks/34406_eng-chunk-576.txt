8 And it came to pass that I was 
a three  days  and  three  nights  in 
the most bitter b pain and c anguish 
of soul; and never, until I did cry 
out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for 
mercy, did I receive a d remission of 
my sins. But behold, I did cry unto 
him and I did find peace to my soul.
9 And  now,  my  son,  I  have  told 
you  this  that  ye  may  learn  wis-
dom, that ye may learn of me that 
there  is  a no  other  way  or  means 
whereby man can be saved, only in 
and through Christ. Behold, he is 
the life and the b light of the world. 
Behold, he is the word of truth and  
c righteousness.

10 And now, as ye have begun to 
teach the word even so I would that 
ye should continue to teach; and I 
would  that  ye  would  be  diligent 
and a temperate in all things.

11 See  that  ye  are  not  lifted  up 
unto pride; yea, see that ye do not 
a boast in your own wisdom, nor of 
your much strength.

12 Use a boldness, but not overbear-
ance;  and  also  see  that  ye  b bridle 
all  your  passions,  that  ye  may  be 
filled with love; see that ye refrain 
from idleness.

13 Do not a pray as the Zoramites 
do, for ye have seen that they pray to 
be heard of men, and to be praised 
for their wisdom.

14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee 
that we are a better than our breth-
ren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive 
my b unworthiness, and remember 
my  brethren  in  mercy—yea,  ac-
knowledge your unworthiness be-
fore God at all times.

15 And may the Lord bless your 
soul, and receive you at the last day 
into  his  kingdom,  to  sit  down  in 
peace. Now go, my son, and teach 
the word unto this people. Be a so-
ber. My son, farewell.
