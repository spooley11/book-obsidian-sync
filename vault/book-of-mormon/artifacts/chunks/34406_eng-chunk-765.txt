4 And  thus  did  pass  away  the 
ninety  and  sixth  year;  and  also  
the  ninety  and  seventh  year;  and 
also  the  ninety  and  eighth  year; 
and also the ninety and ninth year;
5 And  also  an  hundred  years 
had passed away since the days of  
a Mosiah,  who  was  king  over  the 
people of the Nephites.

6 And six hundred and nine years 
had  passed  away  since  Lehi  left  
Jerusalem.

7 And nine years had passed away 
from the time when the sign was 
given, which was spoken of by the 
prophets, that Christ should come 
into the world.

8 Now  the  Nephites  began  to 
a reckon their time from this period

when the sign was given, or from 
the coming of Christ; therefore, nine 
years had passed away.

9 And Nephi, who was the father 
of Nephi, who had the charge of the 
records, a did not return to the land 
of Zarahemla, and could nowhere 
be found in all the land.

10 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did still a remain in wickedness, 
notwithstanding the much preach-
ing  and  prophesying  which  was 
sent among them; and thus passed 
away the tenth year also; and the 
eleventh year also passed away in  
iniquity.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  
thirteenth year there began to be 
wars  and  contentions  throughout 
all the land; for the a Gadianton rob-
bers had become so b numerous, and  
did  slay  so  many  of  the  people,  
and did lay waste so many cities, and  
did  spread  so  much  death  and 
carnage throughout the land, that 
it  became  expedient  that  all  the 
people, both the Nephites and the 
Lamanites,  should  take  up  arms 
against them.
