2 NEPHI 10  : 12–22

a liberty unto the Gentiles, and there 
shall be no  b kings upon the land, 
who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.
12 And  I  will  fortify  this  land

a against all other nations.

13 And  he  that  a fighteth  against

Zion shall b perish, saith God.

14 For he that raiseth up a a king 
against me shall perish, for I, the 
Lord, the  b king of heaven, will be 
their king, and I will be a c light unto 
them forever, that hear my words.
15 Wherefore, for this cause, that 
my  a covenants  may  be  fulfilled 
which I have made unto the children 
of  men,  that  I  will  do  unto  them 
while they are in the flesh, I must 
needs destroy the b secret works of 
c darkness, and of murders, and of 
abominations.

16 Wherefore,  he  that  a fighteth 
against  b Zion,  both  Jew  and  Gen-
tile, both bond and free, both male 
and female, c shall perish; for d they 
are they who are the e whore of all 
the earth; for f they who are g not for 
me are h against me, saith our God.
17 For I will a fulfil my b promises 
which I have made unto the chil-
dren  of  men,  that  I  will  do  unto 
them while they are in the flesh—
18 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, thus saith our God: I will afflict  
thy seed by the hand of the Gen-

tiles;  nevertheless,  I  will  a soften 
the  hearts  of  the  b Gentiles,  that 
they shall be like unto a father to 
them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall 
be c blessed and d numbered among 
the house of Israel.

19 Wherefore,  I  will  a consecrate 
this land unto thy seed, and them 
who shall be numbered among thy 
seed, forever, for the land of their 
inheritance; for it is a choice land, 
saith God unto me, above all other 
lands, wherefore I will have all men 
that dwell thereon that they shall 
worship me, saith God.
