convinced that Alma and Amulek 
had  a  knowledge  of  him,  for  he 
was convinced that they a knew the 
thoughts and intents of his heart; 
for power was given unto them that 
they  might  know  of  these  things 
according to the spirit of prophecy.
8 And Zeezrom began to inquire 
of  them  diligently,  that  he  might 
know  more  concerning  the  king-
dom  of  God.  And  he  said  unto 
Alma: What does this mean which 
Amulek  hath  spoken  concerning 
the resurrection of the dead, that 
all  shall  rise  from  the  dead,  both 
the  a just  and  the  unjust,  and  are 
brought to stand before God to be 
b judged according to their works?
9 And now Alma began to expound 
these  things  unto  him,  saying:  It 
is  given  unto  many  to  a know  the 
b mysteries  of  God;  nevertheless 
they  are  laid  under  a  strict  com-
mand  that  they  shall  not  impart 
c only according to the portion of his 
word which he doth grant unto the 
children of men, according to the 
heed and diligence which they give  
unto him.

10 And  therefore,  he  that  will 
a harden his heart, the same receiv-
eth the b lesser portion of the word; 
and  he  that  will  c not  harden  his 
heart, to him is d given the greater 
portion of the word, until it is given 
unto him to know the mysteries of 
God until he know them in full.

11 And they that will harden their  
hearts, to them is given the lesser 
a portion of the word until they b know 
nothing concerning his mysteries;

and then they are taken captive by 
the devil, and led by his will down 
to destruction. Now this is what is 
meant by the c chains of d hell.

12 And  Amulek  hath  spoken 
plainly  concerning  a death,  and 
being raised from this mortality to 
a  state  of  immortality,  and  being 
brought before the bar of God, to 
be b judged according to our works.
13 Then  if  our  hearts  have  been 
hardened, yea, if we have hardened 
our hearts against the word, inso-
much that it has not been found in 
us, then will our state be awful, for 
then we shall be condemned.
