have, except he should possess the 
power of God, which no man can; 
yet  a  man  may  have  great  power 
given him from God.

17 But a seer can know of things 
which are past, and also of things 
which are to come, and by them shall  
all  things  be  revealed,  or,  rather, 
shall secret things be made mani-
fest, and hidden things shall come 
to light, and things which are not 
known  shall  be  made  known  by 
them, and also things shall be made 
known  by  them  which  otherwise 
could not be known.

18 Thus God has provided a means 
that  man,  through  faith,  might 
work  mighty  miracles;  therefore 
he becometh a great benefit to his 
fellow beings.

19 And  now,  when  Ammon  had 
made an end of speaking these words 
the king rejoiced exceedingly, and  
gave thanks to God, saying: Doubt-
less a  a great mystery is contained 
within these plates, and these inter-
preters were doubtless prepared for 
the purpose of unfolding all such 
mysteries to the children of men.

20 O how marvelous are the works 
of the Lord, and how long doth he 
suffer  with  his  people;  yea,  and 
how  a blind  and  impenetrable  are 
the understandings of the children 
of men; for they will not seek wis-
dom,  neither  do  they  desire  that 
b she should rule over them!

21 Yea,  they  are  as  a  wild  flock 
which fleeth from the shepherd, and  
scattereth, and are driven, and are 
devoured by the beasts of the forest.
