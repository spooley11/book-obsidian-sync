12 And also a a record of the Jews 
from the beginning, even down to 
the commencement of the reign of 
Zedekiah, king of Judah;

13 And also the prophecies of the 
holy prophets, from the beginning, 
even down to the commencement 
of the reign of a Zedekiah; and also 
many prophecies which have been 
spoken by the mouth of b Jeremiah.
14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
father,  Lehi,  also  found  upon  the 
a plates of brass a b genealogy of his 
c fathers;  wherefore  he  knew  that 
he  was  a  descendant  of  d Joseph; 
yea, even that Joseph who was the 
son  of  e Jacob,  who  was  f sold  into 
Egypt, and who was g preserved by 
the hand of the Lord, that he might 
preserve his father, Jacob, and all 
his household from perishing with  
famine.

15 And  they  were  also  a led  out 
of captivity and out of the land of 
Egypt, by that same God who had 
preserved them.

16 And thus my father, Lehi, did 
discover the genealogy of his fathers. 
And Laban also was a descendant 
of  a Joseph,  wherefore  he  and  his 
fathers had kept the b records.

17 And now when my father saw 
all these things, he was filled with 
the Spirit, and began to prophesy 
concerning his seed—

18 That  these  a plates  of  brass 
should go forth unto all  b nations, 
kindreds, tongues, and people who 
were of his seed.

19 Wherefore, he said that these

plates of brass should a never perish; 
neither should they be dimmed any 
more by time. And he prophesied 
many things concerning his seed.

20 And it came to pass that thus 
far  I  and  my  father  had  kept  the 
commandments  wherewith  the 
Lord had commanded us.
