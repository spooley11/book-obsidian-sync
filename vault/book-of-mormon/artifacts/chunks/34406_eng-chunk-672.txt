3 And now behold, I say unto you 
that myself, and also my men, and 
also  Helaman  and  his  men,  have 
suffered exceedingly great a suffer-
ings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and 
fatigue,  and  all  manner  of  afflic-
tions of every kind.

4 But behold, were this all we had 
suffered we would not murmur nor 
complain.

5 But behold, great has been the 
slaughter  among  our  people;  yea, 
thousands have fallen by the sword, 
while it might have otherwise been 
if ye had rendered unto our armies 
sufficient strength and succor for 
them. Yea, great has been your ne-
glect towards us.

6 And now behold, we desire to 
know the cause of this exceedingly 
great  neglect;  yea,  we  desire  to 
know  the  cause  of  your  thought-
less state.

7 Can you think to sit upon your 
thrones  in  a  state  of  thoughtless 
a stupor,  while  your  enemies  are 
spreading the work of death around 
you? Yea, while they are murdering 
thousands of your brethren—

8 Yea, even they who have looked 
up to you for protection, yea, have 
placed  you  in  a  situation  that  ye  
might  have  succored  them,  yea,  
ye  might  have  sent  armies  unto 
them, to have strengthened them, 
and have saved thousands of them 
from falling by the sword.

ALMA 60  : 9–18

9 But  behold,  this  is  not  all—ye 
have withheld your provisions from 
them,  insomuch  that  many  have 
fought and bled out their lives be-
cause of their great desires which  
they had for the welfare of this peo-
ple;  yea,  and  this  they  have  done 
when they were about to a perish with 
hunger, because of your exceedingly  
great neglect towards them.

10 And  now,  my  beloved  breth-
ren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea,  
and ye ought to have stirred your-
selves more diligently for the wel-
fare and the freedom of this people; 
but behold, ye have neglected them 
insomuch that the blood of thou-
sands shall come upon your heads 
for  vengeance;  yea,  for  a known 
unto God were all their cries, and 
all their sufferings—
