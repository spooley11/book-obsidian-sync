38 And  it  came  to  pass  on  the 
other hand, that the Nephites did 
build them up and support them, 
beginning at the more wicked part 
of them, until they had overspread 
all  the  land  of  the  Nephites,  and 
had seduced the more part of the 
righteous until they had come down 
to believe in their works and par-
take of their spoils, and to join with 
them in their secret murders and 
combinations.

39 And thus they did obtain the 
sole  management  of  the  govern-
ment, insomuch that they did tram-
ple under their feet and smite and 
rend and turn their backs upon the 
a poor and the meek, and the hum-
ble followers of God.

40 And thus we see that they were 
in an awful state, and a ripening for 
an everlasting destruction.

41 And it came to pass that thus 
ended  the  sixty  and  eighth  year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

The Prophecy of Nephi, the Son of  
Helaman—God threatens the people 
of Nephi that he will visit them in 
his anger, to their utter destruction 
except  they  repent  of  their  wick-
edness. God smiteth the people of 
Nephi with pestilence; they repent 
and turn unto him. Samuel, a Laman-
ite, prophesies unto the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 7 through 16.

CHAPTER 7

Nephi is rejected in the north and returns 
to Zarahemla—He prays upon his gar-
den tower and then calls upon the people 
to repent or perish. About 23–21 b.c.

Behold, now it came to pass in the 
sixty and ninth year of the reign of 
the judges over the people of the 
Nephites,  that  Nephi,  the  son  of 
Helaman, a returned to the land of 
Zarahemla from the land northward.
2 For he had been forth among the 
people who were in the land north-
ward, and did preach the word of 
God unto them, and did prophesy 
many things unto them;

3 And they did a reject all his words, 
insomuch  that  he  could  not  stay 
among  them,  but  returned  again 
unto the land of his nativity.
