HELAMAN 1  : 8–19

he was about to a flatter away those 
people to rise up in rebellion against 
their brethren.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  as  he  was 
about  to  do  this,  behold,  he  was 
taken, and was tried according to 
the a voice of the people, and con-
demned  unto  death;  for  he  had 
raised up in rebellion and sought to 
destroy the b liberty of the people.
9 Now  when  those  people  who 
were  desirous  that  he  should  be 
their  governor  saw  that  he  was 
condemned unto death, therefore 
they were angry, and behold, they 
sent forth one a Kishkumen, even to 
the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and 
murdered Pahoran as he sat upon 
the judgment-seat.

10 And  he  was  pursued  by  the 
servants of Pahoran; but behold, so 
speedy was the flight of Kishkumen 
that no man could overtake him.

11 And  he  went  unto  those  that 
sent him, and they all entered into 
a covenant, yea, a swearing by their 
everlasting Maker, that they would 
tell  no  man  that  Kishkumen  had 
murdered Pahoran.

12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not 
known among the people of Nephi, 
for he was in disguise at the time 
that  he  murdered  Pahoran.  And 
Kishkumen and his band, who had 
covenanted with him, did mingle 
themselves among the people, in a 
manner that they all could not be 
found; but as many as were found 
were condemned unto a death.

13 And now behold, Pacumeni was 
appointed, according to the a voice 
of the people, to be a chief judge 
and a governor over the people, to 
reign  in  the  stead  of  his  brother 
Pahoran;  and  it  was  according  to 
his right. And all this was done in 
the fortieth year of the reign of the 
judges; and it had an end.

14 And it came to pass in the forty

and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges,  that  the  Lamanites  had 
gathered together an innumerable 
army of men, and a armed them with  
swords,  and  with  cimeters  and  
with bows, and with arrows, and with  
head-plates, and with breastplates, 
and with all manner of shields of 
every kind.
