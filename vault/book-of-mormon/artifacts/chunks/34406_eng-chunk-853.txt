and utter marvelous things; and the 
things  which  they  did  utter  were 
b forbidden  that  there  should  not 
any man write them.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a disciples whom Jesus had chosen 
began b from that time forth to c bap-
tize  and  to  teach  as  many  as  did 
come  unto  them;  and  as  many  as 
were baptized in the name of Jesus 
were filled with the Holy Ghost.

18 And  many  of  them  saw  and 
heard  unspeakable  things,  which 
are a not lawful to be written.

19 And they taught, and did a min-
ister one to another; and they had 
b all things c common among them, 
every man dealing justly, one with 
another.

20 And it came to pass that they 
did do all things even as Jesus had 
commanded them.

21 And  they  who  were  baptized 
in  the  name  of  Jesus  were  called 
the a church of Christ.

CHAPTER 27

Jesus commands them to call the Church 
in His name—His mission and atoning 
sacrifice constitute His gospel—Men are 
commanded to repent and be baptized 
that they may be sanctified by the Holy 
Ghost—They are to be even as Jesus is.

And it came to pass that as the dis-
ciples of Jesus were journeying and 
were  preaching  the  things  which 
they had both heard and seen, and 
were baptizing in the name of Jesus, 
it came to pass that the disciples were 
gathered together and were a united 
in b mighty prayer and c fasting.

2 And Jesus again a showed himself 
unto them, for they were praying

unto the Father in his name; and 
Jesus came and stood in the midst 
of them, and said unto them: What 
will ye that I shall give unto you?

3 And they said unto him: Lord, 
we will that thou wouldst tell us the  
a name  whereby  we  shall  call  this 
church; for there are disputations 
among the people concerning this 
matter.
