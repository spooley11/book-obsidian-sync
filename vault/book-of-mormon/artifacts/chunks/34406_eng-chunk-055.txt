And it came to pass that the angel 
spake unto me, saying: Look! And 
I looked and beheld many nations 
and kingdoms.

2 And the angel said unto me: What 
beholdest thou? And I said: I behold 
many a nations and kingdoms.

3 And he said unto me: These are 
the  nations  and  kingdoms  of  the 
Gentiles.

4 And it came to pass that I saw 
among the nations of the a Gentiles 
the formation of a b great church.

5 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold the formation of a a church 
which  is  most  abominable  above 
all other churches, which b slayeth  
the saints of God, yea, and tortureth  
them and bindeth them down, and  
yoketh them with a c yoke of iron, and  
bringeth them down into captivity.
6 And it came to pass that I beheld 
this a great and b abominable church; 
and I saw the c devil that he was the 
founder of it.

7 And I also saw a gold, and silver, 
and  silks,  and  scarlets,  and  fine-
twined  b linen,  and  all  manner  of 
precious clothing; and I saw many 
harlots.

8 And  the  angel  spake  unto  me, 
saying:  Behold  the  gold,  and  the  
silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, 
and the fine-twined linen, and the 
precious clothing, and the harlots, 
are  the  a desires  of  this  great  and 
abominable church.

9 And also for the  a praise of the 
world  do  they  b destroy  the  saints 
of God, and bring them down into 
captivity.

10 And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld many waters; and they

divided the Gentiles from the seed 
of my brethren.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel  said  unto  me:  Behold  the 
wrath of God is upon the seed of 
thy brethren.

12 And I looked and beheld a man 
among the Gentiles, who was sepa-
rated from the seed of my brethren 
by the many waters; and I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it came down 
and a wrought upon the man; and he 
went forth upon the many waters, 
even unto the seed of my brethren, 
who were in the promised land.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it wrought 
upon other Gentiles; and they went 
forth  out  of  captivity,  upon  the 
many waters.
