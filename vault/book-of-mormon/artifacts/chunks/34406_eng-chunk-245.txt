Begotten  Son,  and  ye  may  obtain 
a  d resurrection,  according  to  the 
e power  of  the  resurrection  which 
is  in  Christ,  and  be  presented  as 
the f first-fruits of Christ unto God, 
having faith, and obtained a good 
hope  of  glory  in  him  before  he 
manifesteth himself in the flesh.

12 And now, beloved, marvel not 
that  I  tell  you  these  things;  for 
why  not  a speak  of  the  atonement 
of  Christ,  and  attain  to  a  perfect 
knowledge of him, as to attain to 
the  knowledge  of  a  resurrection 
and the world to come?

13 Behold,  my  brethren,  he  that 
prophesieth, let him prophesy to the 
understanding of men; for the a Spirit  
speaketh the  b truth and lieth not. 
Wherefore, it speaketh of things as 
they really c are, and of things as they  
really will be; wherefore, these things  
are  manifested  unto  us  d plainly, 
for the salvation of our souls. But 
behold, we are not witnesses alone 
in these things; for God also e spake 
them unto prophets of old.

14 But  behold,  the  Jews  were  a 
a stiffnecked people; and they b de-
spised the words of c plainness, and 
d killed the prophets, and sought for 
things that they could not under-
stand. Wherefore, because of their 
e blindness, which f  blindness came 
by looking beyond the g mark, they 
must needs fall; for God hath taken 
away his plainness from them, and 
delivered unto them many things 
which they h cannot understand, be-

cause they desired it. And because 
they  desired  it  God  hath  done  it, 
that they may i stumble.

15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by 
the Spirit unto prophesying; for I 
perceive by the workings of the Spirit  
which is in me, that by the a stum-
bling of the b Jews they will c reject 
the d stone upon which they might 
build and have safe foundation.

16 But  behold,  according  to  the 
scriptures, this a stone shall become 
the great, and the last, and the only 
sure b foundation, upon which the 
Jews can build.

17 And now, my beloved, how is 
it possible that these, after having 
rejected  the  sure  foundation,  can 
a ever build upon it, that it may be-
come the head of their corner?
