7 And it came to pass that my peo-
ple, with their wives and their chil-
dren, did now behold the  a armies 
of the Lamanites marching towards 
them; and with that awful b fear of 
death which fills the breasts of all 
the  wicked,  did  they  await  to  re-
ceive them.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came to battle against us, and every 
soul was filled with terror because 
of the greatness of their numbers.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did fall upon my people with the 
sword, and with the bow, and with 
the arrow, and with the ax, and with 
all manner of weapons of war.

10 And it came to pass that my men 
were hewn down, yea, even my a ten 
thousand who were with me, and I 
fell wounded in the midst; and they 
passed by me that they did not put 
an end to my life.

11 And when they had gone through  
and hewn down a all my people save 
it were twenty and four of us, (among 
whom  was  my  son  Moroni)  and  
we having survived the dead of our 
people, did behold on the morrow, 
when the Lamanites had returned 
unto their camps, from the top of 
the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand 
of my people who were hewn down, 
being led in the front by me.

12 And  we  also  beheld  the  ten 
thousand of my people who were 
led by my son Moroni.

13 And behold, the ten thousand 
of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he 
also in the midst.

14 And Lamah had fallen with his 
ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen 
with  his  ten  thousand;  and  Lim-
hah had fallen with his ten thou-
sand; and Jeneum had fallen with 
his ten thousand; and Cumenihah, 
and  Moronihah,  and  Antionum, 
and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh,

had fallen with their ten thousand  
each.
