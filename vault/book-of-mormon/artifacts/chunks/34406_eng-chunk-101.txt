CHAPTER 21
The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles  
and will free the prisoners—Israel will 
be gathered with power in the last days—
Kings  will  be  their  nursing  fathers—
Compare Isaiah 49. About 588–570 b.c.
a And  again:  Hearken,  O  ye  house 
of Israel, all ye that are broken off 
and are driven out because of the 
wickedness  of  the  pastors  of  my 
people; yea, all ye that are broken 
off, that are scattered abroad, who 
are  of  my  people,  O  house  of  Is-
rael. Listen, O b isles, unto me, and  
hearken  ye  people  from  c far;  the 
Lord hath called me from the womb; 
from the bowels of my mother hath 
he made mention of my name.

2 And  he  hath  made  my  mouth 
like a sharp sword; in the shadow of 
his hand hath he hid me, and made 
me a polished shaft; in his quiver  
hath he hid me;

3 And said unto me: Thou art my 
a servant, O Israel, in whom I will 
be glorified.

4 Then  I  said,  I  have  labored  in 
a vain,  I  have  spent  my  strength 
for naught and in vain; surely my 
judgment is with the Lord, and my 
work with my God.

5 And  now,  saith  the  Lord—that 
a formed me from the womb that I 
should be his servant, to bring Jacob 
again to him—though Israel be not 
gathered, yet shall I be glorious in 
the eyes of the Lord, and my God 
shall be my b strength.
