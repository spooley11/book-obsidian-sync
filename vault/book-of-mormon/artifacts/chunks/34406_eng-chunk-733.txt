12 And  behold,  now  it  came  to 
pass that when the Lord had spoken 
these words unto Nephi, he did stop 
and did not go unto his own house, 
but did return unto the multitudes 
who  were  scattered  about  upon 
the face of the land, and began to 
declare unto them the word of the 
Lord which had been spoken unto 
him, concerning their destruction 
if they did not repent.

13 Now behold, a notwithstanding 
that  great  miracle  which  Nephi 
had done in telling them concern-
ing  the  death  of  the  chief  judge,

they  did  harden  their  hearts  and 
did not hearken unto the words of  
the Lord.

14 Therefore  Nephi  did  declare 
unto  them  the  word  of  the  Lord, 
saying: Except ye repent, thus saith 
the Lord, ye shall be a smitten even 
unto destruction.

15 And it came to pass that when 
Nephi had declared unto them the 
word, behold, they did still harden 
their hearts and would not hearken 
unto his words; therefore they did 
a revile against him, and did seek to 
lay their hands upon him that they 
might cast him into prison.

16 But behold, the power of God 
was with him, and they could not 
take  him  to  cast  him  into  prison, 
for he was taken by the Spirit and 
a conveyed  away  out  of  the  midst 
of them.

17 And it came to pass that thus 
he did go forth in the Spirit, from 
multitude to multitude, declaring 
the word of God, even until he had 
declared it unto them all, or sent it 
forth among all the people.

18 And it came to pass that they 
would not hearken unto his words; 
and there began to be contentions, 
insomuch that they were divided 
against  themselves  and  began  to 
slay one another with the sword.

19 And thus ended the seventy and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.
