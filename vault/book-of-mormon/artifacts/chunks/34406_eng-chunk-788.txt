3 And  the  people  began  to  look 
with great earnestness for the sign  
which had been given by the prophet  
Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the 
time that there should be a darkness 
for the space of three days over the 
face of the land.

4 And  there  began  to  be  great 
a doubtings and b disputations among 
the  people,  notwithstanding  so 
many signs had been given.

5 And it came to pass in the a thirty 
and fourth year, in the first month, 
on  the  fourth  day  of  the  month, 
there arose a great b storm, such an 
one as never had been known in all  
the land.

6 And there was also a great and 
terrible tempest; and there was ter-
rible a thunder, insomuch that it did 
b shake the whole earth as if it was 
about to divide asunder.

7 And  there  were  exceedingly 
sharp lightnings, such as never had 
been known in all the land.

8 And the a city of Zarahemla did

take fire.

9 And the city of a Moroni did b sink 
into the depths of the sea, and the 
inhabitants thereof were drowned.
10 And the earth was carried up 
upon the city of a Moronihah, that in 
the place of the city there became 
a great b mountain.
