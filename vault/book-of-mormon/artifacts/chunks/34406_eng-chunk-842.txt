b cut off from among my people, O 
house of Israel;

21 And I will execute a vengeance 
and b fury upon them, even as upon 
the heathen, such as they have not 
heard.

22 But if they will repent and heark-
en unto my words, and a harden not 
their  hearts,  I  will  b establish  my 
church among them, and they shall 
come in unto the covenant and be 
c numbered among this the remnant 
of Jacob, unto whom I have given 
this land for their d inheritance;

23 And they shall assist my a peo-
ple, the remnant of Jacob, and also 
as  many  of  the  house  of  Israel  as 
shall come, that they may build a 
city, which shall be called the b New 
Jerusalem.

24 And then shall a they assist my 
people that they may be gathered 
in, who are scattered upon all the 
face of the land, in unto the New 
Jerusalem.

25 And  then  shall  the  a power  of 
heaven  come  down  among  them; 
and b I also will be in the midst.

26 And  then  shall  the  work  of 
the Father commence at that day, 
even  a when  this  gospel  shall  be 
preached  among  the  remnant  of 
b this people. Verily I say unto you, 
at  that  day  shall  the  work  of  the 
Father  commence  among  all  the  
dispersed of my people, yea, even the 
tribes which have been c lost, which 
the  Father  hath  led  away  out  of  
Jerusalem.

27 Yea, the work shall commence 
among  all  the  a dispersed  of  my

people, with the Father to prepare 
the way whereby they may b come 
unto me, that they may call on the 
Father in my name.
