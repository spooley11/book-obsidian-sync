7 Behold, he changed their hearts; 
yea, he awakened them out of a deep 
sleep,  and  they  awoke  unto  God. 
Behold, they were in the midst of 
darkness; nevertheless, their souls 
were  illuminated  by  the  light  of 
the  everlasting  word;  yea,  they 
were encircled about by the a bands 
of  death,  and  the  b chains  of  hell, 
and an everlasting destruction did  
await them.

8 And  now  I  ask  of  you,  my  
brethren,  were  they  destroyed?

Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they  
were not.

9 And again I ask, were the bands 
of death broken, and the a chains of 
hell  which  encircled  them  about, 
were they loosed? I say unto you, 
Yea,  they  were  loosed,  and  their 
souls did expand, and they did b sing 
redeeming love. And I say unto you 
that they are saved.

10 And now I ask of you on what 
conditions  are  they  a saved?  Yea, 
what  grounds  had  they  to  hope 
for salvation? What is the cause of 
their being loosed from the bands 
of death, yea, and also the chains 
of hell?

11 Behold,  I  can  tell  you—did 
not my father Alma believe in the 
words which were delivered by the 
a mouth of Abinadi? And was he not 
a holy prophet? Did he not speak 
the  words  of  God,  and  my  father 
Alma believe them?

12 And according to his faith there 
was a mighty  a change wrought in 
his  heart.  Behold  I  say  unto  you 
that this is all true.

13 And  behold,  he  a preached 
the word unto your fathers, and a 
mighty  change  was  also  wrought 
in their hearts, and they humbled 
themselves and put their b trust in 
the true and  c living God. And be-
hold, they were faithful until the 
d end; therefore they were saved.

14 And now behold, I ask of you, 
my  brethren  of  the  church,  have 
ye a spiritually been b born of God? 
Have ye received his image in your 
countenances? Have ye experienced 
this mighty c change in your hearts?
15 Do  ye  exercise  faith  in  the
