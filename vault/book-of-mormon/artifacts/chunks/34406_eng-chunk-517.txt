8 a Blessed be the name of our God; 
let us b sing to his praise, yea, let us 
give c thanks to his holy name, for 
he doth work righteousness forever.
9 For if we had not come up out 
of  the  land  of  Zarahemla,  these 
our dearly beloved brethren, who 
have  so  dearly  beloved  us,  would 
still have been racked with a hatred 
against us, yea, and they would also 
have been b strangers to God.

10 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon had said these words, his 
brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: 
Ammon,  I  fear  that  thy  joy  doth 
carry thee away unto boasting.

11 But  Ammon  said  unto  him:  I 
do not a boast in my own strength, 
nor in my own wisdom; but behold, 
my  b joy  is  full,  yea,  my  heart  is 
brim with c joy, and I will rejoice in  
my God.

12 Yea,  I  know  that  I  am  a noth-
ing; as to my strength I am weak; 
therefore I will b not boast of myself, 
but I will c boast of my God, for in

his  d strength  I  can  do  all  e things; 
yea,  behold,  many  mighty  mira-
cles we have wrought in this land, 
for which we will praise his name  
forever.

13 Behold, how many thousands of 
our brethren has he loosed from the 
pains of a hell; and they are brought 
to  b sing  redeeming  love,  and  this 
because of the power of his word 
which is in us, therefore have we 
not great reason to rejoice?

14 Yea, we have reason to praise 
him forever, for he is the Most High 
God, and has loosed our brethren 
from the a chains of hell.

15 Yea, they were encircled about 
with  everlasting  a darkness  and 
destruction;  but  behold,  he  has 
brought them into his everlasting 
b light, yea, into everlasting salvation; 
and they are encircled about with 
the  matchless  bounty  of  his  love; 
yea, and we have been instruments 
in  his  hands  of  doing  this  great  
and marvelous work.
