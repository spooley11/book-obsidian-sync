ering  you,  except  ye  will  repent, 
behold, he shall scatter you forth 
that ye shall become meat for dogs 
and wild beasts.

20 O, how could you have a forgot-
ten your God in the very day that 
he has delivered you?

21 But behold, it is to get a gain, to 
be  b praised of men, yea, and that 
ye might get gold and silver. And 
ye  have  set  your  hearts  upon  the 
c riches and the vain things of this 
world, for the which ye do murder, 
and  plunder,  and  steal,  and  bear 
d false witness against your neigh-
bor, and do all manner of iniquity.
22 And for this cause a wo shall come 
unto  you  except  ye  shall  repent.

For  if  ye  will  not  repent,  behold, 
this  b great city, and also all those 
great cities which are round about, 
which are in the land of our pos-
session,  shall  be  taken  away  that 
ye shall have no place in them; for 
behold, the Lord will not grant unto 
you  c strength,  as  he  has  hitherto 
done,  to  withstand  against  your  
enemies.

23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: 
I will not show unto the wicked of 
my strength, to one more than the 
other,  save  it  be  unto  those  who 
repent  of  their  sins,  and  hearken 
unto  my  words.  Now  therefore,  I 
would  that  ye  should  behold,  my 
brethren, that it shall be a better for 
the Lamanites than for you except 
ye shall repent.
