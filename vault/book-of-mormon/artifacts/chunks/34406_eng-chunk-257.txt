66 For it grieveth me that I should 
lose the trees of my vineyard; where-
fore ye shall clear away the bad ac-
cording as the good shall grow, that 
the root and the top may be equal 
in  strength,  until  the  good  shall 
overcome the bad, and the bad be 
hewn down and cast into the fire, 
that they cumber not the ground of 
my vineyard; and thus will I sweep 
away the bad out of my vineyard.
67 And  the  branches  of  the  nat-
ural tree will I graft in again into 
the natural tree;

68 And the branches of the natu-
ral tree will I graft into the natural 
branches of the tree; and thus will 
I  bring  them  together  again,  that 
they shall bring forth the natural 
a fruit, and they shall be one.

69 And the bad shall be a cast away, 
yea, even out of all the land of my 
vineyard; for behold, only this once 
will I prune my vineyard.

70 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard sent his a ser-
vant; and the servant went and did 
as the Lord had commanded him, 
and  brought  other  b servants;  and 
they were c few.

71 And the Lord of the vineyard

said unto them: Go to, and  a labor 
in the vineyard, with your might. 
For  behold,  this  is  the  b last  time 
that I shall c nourish my vineyard; 
for the end is nigh at hand, and the 
season speedily cometh; and if ye  
labor  with  your  might  with  me  
ye shall have joy in the fruit which 
I shall lay up unto myself against 
the time which will soon come.

72 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servants did go and labor with their 
mights; and the Lord of the vineyard 
labored  also  with  them;  and  they  
did obey the commandments of the 
Lord of the vineyard in all things.
73 And there began to be the natu-
ral fruit again in the vineyard; and 
the natural branches began to grow 
and thrive exceedingly; and the wild 
branches began to be plucked off 
and to be cast away; and they did 
keep the root and the top thereof 
equal,  according  to  the  strength 
thereof.
