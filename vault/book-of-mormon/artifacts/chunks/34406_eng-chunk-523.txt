6 But the king said unto them: Be-
hold, the Nephites will destroy us, 
because of the many murders and 
sins  we  have  committed  against 
them.

7 And Ammon said: I will go and 
inquire of the Lord, and if he say 
unto us, go down unto our breth-
ren, will ye go?

8 And the king said unto him: Yea, 
if the Lord saith unto us go, we will 
go  down  unto  our  brethren,  and 
we will be their slaves until we re-
pair unto them the many murders 
and sins which we have committed 
against them.

9 But  Ammon  said  unto  him:  It 
is against the law of our brethren, 
which was established by my father, 
that  there  should  be  any  a slaves 
among  them;  therefore  let  us  go 
down  and  rely  upon  the  mercies 
of our brethren.

10 But the king said unto him: In-
quire of the Lord, and if he saith 
unto  us  go,  we  will  go;  otherwise 
we will perish in the land.

11 And it came to pass that Am-
mon went and inquired of the Lord, 
and the Lord said unto him:

12 Get  this  people  a out  of  this 
land, that they perish not; for Sa-
tan has great hold on the hearts of 
the Amalekites, who do stir up the 
Lamanites  to  anger  against  their 
brethren to slay them; therefore get 
thee out of this land; and blessed 
are this people in this generation, 
for I will b preserve them.

13 And now it came to pass that 
Ammon went and told the king all 
the words which the Lord had said 
unto him.

14 And they gathered together all 
their people, yea, all the people of 
the Lord, and did gather together 
all their flocks and herds, and de-
parted  out  of  the  land,  and  came 
into the wilderness which divided 
the land of Nephi from the land of 
Zarahemla, and came over near the 
borders of the land.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon said unto them: Behold, I and 
my brethren will go forth into the 
land of Zarahemla, and ye shall re-
main here until we return; and we 
will a try the hearts of our brethren, 
whether they will that ye shall come 
into their land.
