ALMA 34  : 28–37

28 And now behold, my beloved 
brethren, I say unto you, do not sup-
pose that this is all; for after ye have 
done  all  these  things,  if  ye  a turn 
away  the  b needy,  and  the  c naked, 
and visit not the sick and afflicted, 
and d impart of your substance, if ye 
have, to those who stand in need—I 
say  unto  you,  if  ye  do  not  any  of 
these things, behold, your e prayer 
is f vain, and availeth you nothing, 
and ye are as  g hypocrites who do 
deny the faith.

29 Therefore, if ye do not remem-
ber to be a charitable, ye are as dross, 
which the refiners do cast out, (it 
being of no worth) and is trodden 
under foot of men.

30 And now, my brethren, I would 
that,  after  ye  have  a received  so 
many witnesses, seeing that the holy 
scriptures testify of these things, ye 
come  forth  and  bring  b fruit  unto 
repentance.

31 Yea, I would that ye would come 
forth and a harden not your hearts 
any longer; for behold, now is the 
time and the b day of your c salvation;  
and therefore, if ye will repent and 
d harden not your hearts, immedi-
ately shall the great plan of redemp-
tion be brought about unto you.
