3 And it came to pass that the king 
of the Lamanites did grant unto me 
the thing which I desired.

4 And it came to pass that we did 
march forth to the land of Cumorah, 
and we did pitch our tents around 
about the hill Cumorah; and it was in 
a land of   a many waters, rivers, and  
fountains; and here we had hope to 
gain advantage over the Lamanites.
5 And when  a three hundred and 
eighty  and  four  years  had  passed 
away,  we  had  gathered  in  all  the 
remainder of our people unto the 
land of Cumorah.

6 And it came to pass that when 
we had gathered in all our people 
in one to the land of Cumorah, be-
hold I, Mormon, began to be old; and 
knowing it to be the last struggle of 
my people, and having been com-
manded of the Lord that I should 
not  suffer  the  records  which  had 
been handed down by our fathers, 
which were a sacred, to fall into the 
hands  of  the  Lamanites,  (for  the 
Lamanites  would  b destroy  them) 
therefore  I  made  c this  record  out 
of the plates of Nephi, and d hid up 
in the hill Cumorah all the records 
which had been entrusted to me by 
the hand of the Lord, save it were 
e these few plates which I gave unto 
my son f  Moroni.
