6 Nevertheless, after they shall be 
a nursed  by  the  b Gentiles,  and  the 
Lord has lifted up his hand upon 
the Gentiles and set them up for a 
standard, and their c children have 
been  carried  in  their  arms,  and 
their daughters have been carried 
upon their shoulders, behold these 
things of which are spoken are tem-
poral;  for  thus  are  the  covenants 
of the Lord with our fathers; and 
it meaneth us in the days to come, 
and also all our brethren who are 
of the house of Israel.

7 And  it  meaneth  that  the  time 
cometh that after all the house of 
Israel have been scattered and con-
founded,  that  the  Lord  God  will 
raise up a mighty nation among the 
a Gentiles, yea, even upon the face 
of this land; and by them shall our 
seed be b scattered.

1 NEPHI 22  : 9–16

Lord God will proceed to do a a mar-
velous  work  among  the  b Gentiles, 
which shall be of great c worth unto 
our  seed;  wherefore,  it  is  likened 
unto their being nourished by the 
d Gentiles and being carried in their 
arms and upon their shoulders.

9 And  it  shall  also  be  of  a worth 
unto the Gentiles; and not only unto 
the Gentiles but b unto all the c house 
of Israel, unto the making known 
of the d covenants of the Father of 
heaven  unto  Abraham,  saying:  In 
thy e seed shall all the kindreds of 
the earth be f  blessed.
