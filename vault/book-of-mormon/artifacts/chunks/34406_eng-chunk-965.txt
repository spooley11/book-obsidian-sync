The Book of Moroni

CHAPTER 1
Moroni writes for the benefit of the La-
manites—The  Nephites  who  will  not 
deny  Christ  are  put  to  death.  About 
a.d. 401–21.

NOW  I,  Moroni,  after  having

made  an  end  of  abridging 
the account of the people of 
Jared, I had supposed a not to have 
written more, but I have not as yet 
perished;  and  I  make  not  myself 
known to the Lamanites lest they 
should destroy me.

2 For behold, their  a wars are ex-
ceedingly fierce among themselves; 
and because of their  b hatred they 
c put  to  death  every  Nephite  that 
will not deny the Christ.

3 And  I,  Moroni,  will  not  a deny 
the  Christ;  wherefore,  I  wander 
whithersoever I can for the safety 
of mine own life.

4 Wherefore,  I  write  a  few  more 
things,  contrary  to  that  which  I 
had supposed; for I had supposed 
not to have written any more; but  
I write a few more things, that per-
haps  they  may  be  of   a worth  unto 
my brethren, the Lamanites, in some 
future day, according to the will of  
the Lord.

MORONI 2  : 1–5  : 2

The words of Christ, which he spake 
unto his a disciples, the twelve whom 
he had chosen, as he laid his hands 
upon them—

2 And  he  called  them  by  name, 
saying: Ye shall a call on the Father 
in my name, in mighty prayer; and 
after ye have done this ye shall have 
b power that to him upon whom ye 
shall lay your c hands, d ye shall give 
the  Holy  Ghost;  and  in  my  name 
shall  ye  give  it,  for  thus  do  mine  
apostles.
