are, and which are to come; where-

your God.

wherefore,  they  may  be  a likened 
unto you, for ye are of the house of 
Israel. And there are many things 
which have been spoken by Isaiah 
which may be likened unto you, be-
cause ye are of the house of Israel.
6 And  now,  these  are  the  words: 
a Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, 
I  will  lift  up  mine  hand  to  the  
Gentiles, and set up my b standard 
to the people; and they shall bring 
thy  sons  in  their  arms,  and  thy  
daughters shall be carried upon their  
shoulders.

7 And a kings shall be thy nursing 
fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers; they shall bow down 
to thee with their faces towards the 
earth, and lick up the dust of thy 
feet;  and  thou  shalt  know  that  b I 
am the Lord; for they shall not be 
ashamed that c wait for me.

8 And now I, Jacob, would speak 
somewhat concerning these words. 
For behold, the Lord has shown me 
that those who were at a Jerusalem, 
from whence we came, have been 
b slain and c carried away captive.
