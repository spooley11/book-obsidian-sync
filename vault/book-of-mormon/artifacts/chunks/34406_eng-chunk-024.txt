22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
went down to the land of our inheri-
tance, and we did gather together 
our  a gold, and our silver, and our 
precious things.

23 And after we had gathered these 
things together, we went up again 
unto the house of Laban.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
went  in  unto  Laban,  and  desired 
him that he would give unto us the 
records which were engraven upon  
the  a plates  of  brass,  for  which  we 
would give unto him our gold, and our  
silver, and all our precious things.

25 And it came to pass that when 
Laban saw our property, and that it 
was exceedingly great, he did a lust 
after it, insomuch that he thrust us 
out, and sent his servants to slay us, 
that he might obtain our property.
26 And  a it  came  to  pass  that  we 
did flee before the servants of La-
ban, and we were obliged to leave 
behind our property, and it fell into 
the hands of Laban.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
fled  into  the  wilderness,  and  the 
servants of Laban did not overtake 
us,  and  we  a hid  ourselves  in  the 
cavity of a rock.

28 And it came to pass that Laman 
was angry with me, and also with 
my  father;  and  also  was  Lemuel, 
for  he  hearkened  unto  the  words 
of  Laman.  Wherefore  Laman  and 
Lemuel did speak many a hard words 
unto us, their younger brothers, and 
they did smite us even with a rod.
29 And  it  came  to  pass  as  they

smote  us  with  a  rod,  behold,  an 
a angel of the Lord came and stood 
before  them,  and  he  spake  unto 
them, saying: Why do ye smite your 
younger brother with a rod? Know 
ye  not  that  the  Lord  hath  chosen 
him to be a b ruler over you, and this 
because of your iniquities? Behold 
ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, 
and  the  Lord  will  c deliver  Laban 
into your hands.

30 And after the  a angel had spo-

ken unto us, he departed.
