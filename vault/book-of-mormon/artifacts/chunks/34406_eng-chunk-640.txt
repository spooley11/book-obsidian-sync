17 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum made preparations to make an 
attack upon the city of Mulek, and 
march forth with his army against 
the Lamanites; but he saw that it was 
impossible that he could overpower 
them while they were in their for-

his designs and returned again to 
the city Bountiful, to wait for the

Jacob, who was a a Zoramite, would 
not come out with his army to meet 
them upon the plains.

having no hopes of meeting them 
upon fair grounds, therefore, he re-
