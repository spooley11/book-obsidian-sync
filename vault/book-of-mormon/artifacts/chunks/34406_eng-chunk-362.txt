23 And  the  king  having  been 
without the gates of the city with 
his guard, a discovered Ammon and 
his brethren; and supposing them 
to be priests of Noah therefore he 
caused that they should be taken, 
and bound, and cast into  b prison. 
And had they been the priests of 
Noah  he  would  have  caused  that 
they should be put to death.

24 But when he found that they 
were  not,  but  that  they  were  his 
brethren, and had come from the 
a land of Zarahemla, he was filled 
with exceedingly great joy.

25 Now king Limhi had sent, pre-
vious to the coming of Ammon, a 
a small  number  of  men  to  b search 
for the land of Zarahemla; but they 
could not find it, and they were lost 
in the wilderness.

26 Nevertheless,  they  did  find  a 
land which had been peopled; yea, 
a land which was covered with dry 
a bones; yea, a land which had been 
peopled  and  which  had  been  de-
stroyed; and they, having supposed 
it to be the land of Zarahemla, re-
turned to the land of Nephi, having 
arrived in the borders of the land 
not many days before the b coming 
of Ammon.

27 And they brought a a record with 
them, even a record of the people 
whose bones they had found; and 
it was engraven on plates of ore.

28 And now Limhi was again filled 
with joy on learning from the mouth 
of Ammon that king Mosiah had a 
a gift from God, whereby he could 
b interpret such engravings; yea, and 
Ammon also did rejoice.

29 Yet Ammon and his brethren 
were filled with sorrow because so
