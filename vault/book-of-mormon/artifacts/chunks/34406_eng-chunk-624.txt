15 And now, behold, this was wis-
dom in Moroni; for he had supposed 
that  they  would  be  frightened  at 
the  city  Ammonihah;  and  as  the 
city of Noah had hitherto been the 
weakest part of the land, therefore 
they  would  march  thither  to  bat-
tle;  and  thus  it  was  according  to  
his desires.

16 And  behold,  Moroni  had  ap-
pointed  Lehi  to  be  chief  captain 
over the men of that city; and it was 
that  a same  Lehi  who  fought  with 
the Lamanites in the valley on the 
east of the river Sidon.

17 And  now  behold  it  came  to 
pass, that when the Lamanites had 
found  that  Lehi  commanded  the 
city they were again disappointed, 
for  they  feared  Lehi  exceedingly; 
nevertheless  their  chief  captains 
had a sworn with an oath to attack 
the city; therefore, they brought up 
their armies.

18 Now  behold,  the  Lamanites 
could  not  get  into  their  forts  of 
security by any other way save by 
the entrance, because of the high-
ness of the bank which had been 
thrown  up,  and  the  depth  of  the

ditch  which  had  been  dug  round 
about, save it were by the entrance.
19 And thus were the Nephites pre-
pared to destroy all such as should 
attempt to climb up to enter the fort 
by any other way, by casting over 
stones and arrows at them.

20 Thus they were prepared, yea, 
a body of their strongest men, with 
their  swords  and  their  slings,  to 
smite down all who should attempt 
to  come  into  their  place  of  secu-
rity by the place of a entrance; and 
thus were they prepared to defend 
themselves against the Lamanites.
21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
captains of the Lamanites brought 
up  their  armies  before  the  place 
of entrance, and began to contend 
with the Nephites, to get into their 
place of security; but behold, they 
were driven back from time to time, 
insomuch that they were slain with 
an immense slaughter.
