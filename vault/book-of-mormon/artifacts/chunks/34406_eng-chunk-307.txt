6 And  now,  these  are  the  words 
which  king  Benjamin  desired  of 
them;  and  therefore  he  said  unto 
them:  Ye  have  spoken  the  words 
that  I  desired;  and  the  covenant 
which ye have made is a righteous 
covenant.

7 And  now,  because  of  the  cov-
enant which ye have made ye shall 
be  called  the  a children  of  Christ, 
his sons, and his daughters; for be-
hold,  this  day  he  hath  spiritually 
begotten you; for ye say that your 
hearts are b changed through faith 
on his name; therefore, ye are c born 
of him and have become his d sons 
and his daughters.

8 And under this head ye are made 
a free, and there is  b no other head 
whereby ye can be made free. There 
is  no  other  c name  given  whereby 
salvation cometh; therefore, I would 
that ye should d take upon you the 
name  of  Christ,  all  you  that  have 
entered into the covenant with God 
that ye should be obedient unto the 
end of your lives.

9 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
whosoever doeth this shall be found 
at  the  right  hand  of  God,  for  he

shall know the name by which he 
is called; for he shall be called by 
the name of Christ.

10 And now it shall come to pass, 
that whosoever shall not take upon 
him  the  name  of  Christ  must  be 
called by some a other name; there-
fore, he findeth himself on the b left 
hand of God.

11 And I would that ye should re-
member also, that this is the a name 
that I said I should give unto you 
that  never  should  be  blotted  out, 
except it be through transgression; 
therefore, take heed that ye do not 
transgress,  that  the  name  be  not 
blotted out of your hearts.

12 I  say  unto  you,  I  would  that 
ye should remember to a retain the 
name written always in your hearts, 
that  ye  are  not  found  on  the  left 
hand of God, but that ye hear and 
know the voice by which ye shall 
be  called,  and  also,  the  name  by 
which he shall call you.

13 For  how  a knoweth  a  man  the 
master  whom  he  has  not  served, 
and  who  is  a  stranger  unto  him, 
and  is  far  from  the  thoughts  and 
intents of his heart?
