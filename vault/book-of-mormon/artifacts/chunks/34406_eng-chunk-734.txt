HELAMAN 11  : 1–15

And now it came to pass in the sev-
enty and second year of the reign 
of the judges that the contentions 
did increase, insomuch that there 
were wars throughout all the land 
among all the people of Nephi.

2 And it was this a secret band of 
robbers who did carry on this work 
of destruction and wickedness. And 
this war did last all that year; and 
in the seventy and third year it did 
also last.

3 And it came to pass that in this 
year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, 
saying:

4 O Lord, do not suffer that this 
people  shall  be  destroyed  by  the 
sword; but O Lord, rather a let there 
be  a  b famine  in  the  land,  to  stir 
them  up  in  remembrance  of  the 
Lord their God, and perhaps they 
will repent and turn unto thee.

5 And  so  it  was  done,  according 
to the words of Nephi. And there 
was a great famine upon the land, 
among all the people of Nephi. And 
thus in the seventy and fourth year 
the famine did continue, and the 
work of destruction did cease by the 
sword but became sore by famine.
6 And this work of destruction did 
also  continue  in  the  seventy  and 
fifth year. For the earth was smitten 
that it was a dry, and did not yield 
forth grain in the season of grain; 
and the whole earth was smitten, 
even among the Lamanites as well 
as among the Nephites, so that they 
were smitten that they did perish 
by thousands in the more wicked 
parts of the land.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people saw that they were about to 
perish by famine, and they began 
to  a remember the Lord their God; 
and  they  began  to  remember  the 
words of Nephi.

8 And the people a began to plead 
with  their  chief  judges  and  their
