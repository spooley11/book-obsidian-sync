looked, and I beheld the Son of God 
a going forth among the children of 
men; and I saw many fall down at 
his feet and worship him.

which waters are a representation 
of the love of God; and I also beheld 
that the tree of life was a represen-
tation of the love of God.

descension of God!

Redeemer  of  the  world,  of  whom 
my  father  had  spoken;  and  I  also

prepare the way before him. And 
the  Lamb  of  God  went  forth  and  
was  c baptized  of  him;  and  after  
he was baptized, I beheld the heav-
ens open, and the Holy Ghost come 
down out of heaven and abide upon 
him in the form of a d dove.
