7 For they became a righteous peo-
ple; they did lay down the weapons 
of their rebellion, that they did not 
fight against God any more, neither 
against any of their brethren.

8 Now, these are  a they who were

converted unto the Lord:

9 The  people  of  the  Lamanites

who were in the land of Ishmael;

10 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites  who  were  in  the  land 
of a Middoni;

11 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites who were in the city of 
Nephi;

12 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites who were in the land of 
a Shilom, and who were in the land 
of Shemlon, and in the city of Lem-
uel, and in the city of Shimnilom.
13 And these are the names of the 
cities of the Lamanites which were 
a converted unto the Lord; and these 
are they that laid down the weap-
ons of their rebellion, yea, all their 
weapons of war; and they were all 
Lamanites.

14 And the Amalekites were not

a converted, save only one; neither 
were any of the b Amulonites; but they  
did  harden  their  hearts,  and  also 
the hearts of the Lamanites in that 
part of the land wheresoever they 
dwelt, yea, and all their villages and  
all their cities.

15 Therefore, we have named all 
the cities of the Lamanites in which 
they  did  repent  and  come  to  the 
knowledge of the truth, and were 
converted.

16 And now it came to pass that the 
king and those who were converted 
were desirous that they might have 
a name, that thereby they might be 
distinguished from their brethren; 
therefore the king consulted with 
Aaron and many of their priests, con-
cerning the name that they should 
take  upon  them,  that  they  might  
be distinguished.
