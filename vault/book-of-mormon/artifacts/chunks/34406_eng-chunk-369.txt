29 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  did  soften  the  hearts  of  the 
Lamanites. And Alma and his breth-
ren went forth and delivered them-
selves up into their hands; and the 
Lamanites  took  possession  of  the 
land of Helam.

30 Now the a armies of the Laman-

ites, which had followed after the 
people of king Limhi, had been lost 
in the wilderness for many days.

31 And  behold,  they  had  found 
those  priests  of  king  Noah,  in  a 
place which they called  a Amulon; 
and they had begun to possess the 
land of Amulon and had begun to 
till the ground.

32 Now the name of the leader of

those priests was a Amulon.

33 And it came to pass that Amulon 
did plead with the Lamanites; and 
he also sent forth their wives, who 
were the a daughters of the Laman-
ites, to plead with their brethren, 
that they should not destroy their 
husbands.

34 And the Lamanites had a com-
passion on Amulon and his brethren, 
and did not destroy them, because  
of their wives.

35 And a Amulon and his brethren 
did  join  the  Lamanites,  and  they 
were traveling in the wilderness in 
search of the land of Nephi when 
they discovered the land of Helam, 
which was possessed by Alma and 
his brethren.

36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites promised unto Alma and 
his brethren, that if they would show 
them the a way which led to the land  
of Nephi that they would grant unto 
them their lives and their liberty.
37 But  after  Alma  had  shown 
them the way that led to the land 
of Nephi the Lamanites would not 
keep  their  promise;  but  they  set 
a guards  round  about  the  land  of 
Helam, over Alma and his brethren.
38 And  the  remainder  of  them 
went  to  the  land  of  Nephi;  and  a 
part of them returned to the land 
of  Helam,  and  also  brought  with 
them  the  wives  and  the  children 
of the guards who had been left in  
the land.
