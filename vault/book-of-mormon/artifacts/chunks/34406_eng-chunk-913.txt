ETHER 2  : 16–25

any more, for ye shall remember that 
my  a Spirit  will  not  always  b strive 
with man; wherefore, if ye will sin 
until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut  
off from the presence of the Lord. 
And these are my  c thoughts upon 
the land which I shall give you for 
your inheritance; for it shall be a 
land d choice above all other lands.
16 And the Lord said: Go to work 
and  build,  after  the  manner  of 
a barges  which  ye  have  hitherto 
built. And it came to pass that the 
brother of Jared did go to work, and 
also his brethren, and built barges 
after the manner which they had 
built, according to the b instructions 
of the Lord. And they were small, 
and they were light upon the wa-
ter, even like unto the lightness of 
a fowl upon the water.

17 And  they  were  built  after  a 
manner that they were exceedingly 
a tight, even that they would hold wa-
ter like unto a dish; and the bottom 
thereof was tight like unto a dish; 
and the sides thereof were tight like 
unto a dish; and the ends thereof 
were peaked; and the top thereof 
was tight like unto a dish; and the 
length thereof was the length of a 
tree;  and  the  door  thereof,  when 
it  was  shut,  was  tight  like  unto  
a dish.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared cried unto the Lord,  
saying: O Lord, I have performed the 
work which thou hast commanded 
me, and I have made the barges ac-
cording as thou hast directed me.

19 And  behold,  O  Lord,  in  them 
there is no light; whither shall we 
steer? And also we shall perish, for 
in them we cannot breathe, save it 
is the air which is in them; there-
fore we shall perish.
