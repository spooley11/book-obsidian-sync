24 For behold, the a language which 
ye shall write I have confounded; 
wherefore I will cause in my own 
due  time  that  these  stones  shall 
magnify to the eyes of men these 
things which ye shall write.

25 And  when  the  Lord  had  said 
these words, he  a showed unto the 
brother  of  Jared  b all  the  inhabi-
tants of the earth which had been, 
and also all that would be; and he 
c withheld them not from his sight, 
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 For  he  had  said  unto  him  in 
times before, that a if he would b be-
lieve in him that he could show unto 
him c all things—it should be shown 
unto him; therefore the Lord could 
not withhold anything from him, 
for  he  knew  that  the  Lord  could 
show him all things.

27 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Write these things and a seal them 
up; and I will show them in mine 
own due time unto the children of  
men.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  commanded  him  that  he 
should seal up the two a stones which 
he had received, and show them not, 
until  the  Lord  should  show  them 
unto the children of b men.

CHAPTER 4

Moroni  is  commanded  to  seal  up  the 
writings of the brother of Jared—They 
will not be revealed until men have faith 
even  as  the  brother  of  Jared—Christ 
commands  men  to  believe  His  words 
and  those  of  His  disciples—Men  are 
commanded to repent, believe the gos-
pel, and be saved.

And  the  Lord  commanded  the 
brother of Jared to go down out of 
the a mount from the presence of the 
Lord, and b write the things which 
he had seen; and they were forbid-
den to come unto the children of 
men c until after that he should be 
lifted up upon the cross; and for this 
cause did king Mosiah keep them, 
that they should not come unto the 
world until after Christ should show 
himself unto his people.

2 And after Christ truly had showed  
himself  unto  his  people  he  com-
manded that they should be made 
manifest.
