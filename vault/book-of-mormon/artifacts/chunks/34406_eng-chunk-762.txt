15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
words  which  came  unto  Nephi 
were  fulfilled,  according  as  they 
had been spoken; for behold, at the 
going down of the  a sun there was 
b no darkness; and the people began 
to be astonished because there was 
no darkness when the night came.
16 And  there  were  many,  who 
had not believed the words of the 
prophets, who a fell to the earth and 
became  as  if  they  were  dead,  for 
they knew that the great  b plan of 
destruction which they had laid for 
those who believed in the words of 
the prophets had been frustrated; 
for the sign which had been given 
was already at hand.

17 And they began to know that 
the Son of God must shortly appear; 
yea, in fine, all the people upon the 
face  of  the  whole  earth  from  the 
a west to the east, both in the land 
north and in the land south, were 
so exceedingly astonished that they 
fell to the earth.

18 For they knew that the proph-
ets had testified of these things for 
many years, and that the sign which 
had been given was already at hand; 
and they began to fear because of 
their iniquity and their unbelief.

19 And it came to pass that there 
was no darkness in all that night, 
but it was as light as though it was 
mid-day. And it came to pass that the 
sun did rise in the morning again, 
according to its proper order; and 
they knew that it was the day that 
the Lord should be a born, because 
of the b sign which had been given.

20 And it had come to pass, yea, 
all things, every whit, according to 
the words of the prophets.

21 And it came to pass also that 
a new  a star did appear, according 
to the word.

22 And it came to pass that from 
this  time  forth  there  began  to  be 
a lyings sent forth among the people, 
by Satan, to harden their hearts, to 
the intent that they might not be-
lieve in those  b signs and wonders 
which they had seen; but notwith-
standing these lyings and deceivings 
the  c more  part  of  the  people  did 
believe, and were converted unto  
the Lord.
