21 And now behold, my brethren, 
what  a natural  man  is  there  that 
knoweth  these  things?  I  say  unto 
you, there is  b none that  c knoweth 
these things, save it be the penitent.
22 Yea, he that a repenteth and ex-
erciseth  faith, and  bringeth  forth 
good  b works,  and  prayeth  contin-
ually  without  ceasing—unto  such 
it is given to know the  c mysteries 
of God; yea, unto such it shall be 
d given to e reveal things which never 
have  been  revealed;  yea,  and  it 
shall be given unto such to bring 
thousands  of  souls  to  repentance, 
even  as  it  has  been  given  unto 
us  to  bring  these  our  brethren  to  
repentance.

23 Now do ye remember, my breth-
ren, that we said unto our brethren 
in the land of Zarahemla, we go up 
to the land of Nephi, to preach unto 
our  brethren,  the  Lamanites,  and 
they a laughed us to scorn?

24 For they said unto us: Do ye sup-
pose that ye can bring the Laman-
ites to the knowledge of the truth? 
Do ye suppose that ye can convince 
the Lamanites of the a incorrectness 
of the  b traditions of their fathers,

as c stiffnecked a people as they are; 
whose hearts delight in the d shed-
ding  of  blood;  whose  days  have 
been spent in the grossest iniquity; 
whose ways have been the ways of 
a transgressor from the beginning? 
Now my brethren, ye remember that 
this was their language.

25 And moreover they did say: Let 
us take up arms against them, that 
we destroy them and their iniquity 
out of the land, lest they overrun 
us and destroy us.

26 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren,  we  came  into  the  wilderness 
not with the intent to destroy our 
brethren, but with the intent that 
perhaps  we  might  save  some  few 
of their souls.

27 Now when our hearts were de-
pressed, and we were about to a turn 
back, behold, the Lord b comforted 
us, and said: Go amongst thy breth-
ren, the Lamanites, and bear with 
c patience  thine  d afflictions,  and  I 
will give unto you success.
