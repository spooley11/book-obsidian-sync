30 Yea,  and  there  was  continual 
peace among them, and exceedingly 
great prosperity in the church be-
cause of their heed and diligence 
which they gave unto the word of 
God, which was declared unto them 
by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Cori-
anton, and Ammon and his breth-
ren, yea, and by all those who had 
been ordained by the  a holy order 
of  God,  being  baptized  unto  re-
pentance, and sent forth to preach 
among the people.

CHAPTER 50

Moroni fortifies the lands of the Neph-
ites—They build many new cities—Wars 
and destructions befell the Nephites in 
the days of their wickedness and abomi-
nations—Morianton and his dissenters 
are defeated by Teancum—Nephihah 
dies, and his son Pahoran fills the judg-
ment seat. About 72–67 b.c.
And now it came to pass that Moroni 
did not stop making preparations for 
war, or to defend his people against 
the Lamanites; for he caused that 
his armies should commence in the 
commencement  of  the  twentieth 
year of the reign of the judges, that 
they should commence in digging 
up  a heaps  of  earth  round  about 
all  the  cities,  throughout  all  the 
land  which  was  possessed  by  the  
Nephites.

2 And upon the top of these ridges 
of earth he caused that there should 
be a timbers, yea, works of timbers 
built  up  to  the  height  of  a  man, 
round about the cities.

3 And he caused that upon those 
works of timbers there should be 
a frame of pickets built upon the 
timbers round about; and they were 
strong and high.

4 And  he  caused  towers  to  be 
erected that overlooked those works 
of pickets, and he caused places of se-
curity to be built upon those a towers,  
that the stones and the arrows of  
the Lamanites could not hurt them.
5 And  they  were  prepared  that 
they could cast stones from the top 
thereof, according to their pleasure 
and  their  strength,  and  slay  him 
who  should  attempt  to  approach 
near the walls of the city.
