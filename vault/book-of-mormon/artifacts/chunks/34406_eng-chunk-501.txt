14 And since man had a fallen he 
could not b merit anything of him-
self; but the sufferings and c death 
of  Christ  d atone  for  their  sins, 
through faith and repentance, and 
so forth; and that he breaketh the 
bands of death, that the e grave shall 
have no victory, and that the sting 
of  death  should  be  swallowed  up 
in  the  hopes  of  glory;  and  Aaron 
did expound all these things unto  
the king.

15 And it came to pass that after 
Aaron had expounded these things

I do that I may have this eternal life 
of  which  thou  hast  spoken?  Yea, 
what shall I do that I may be b born 
of  God,  having  this  wicked  spirit 
c rooted out of my breast, and receive 
his Spirit, that I may be filled with 
joy, that I may not be cast off at the 
last day ? Behold, said he, I will give 
up d all that I possess, yea, I will for-
sake my kingdom, that I may receive  
this great joy.

wilt repent of all thy sins, and will 
bow down before God, and call on 
his name in faith, believing that ye 
shall receive, then shalt thou receive 
the b hope which thou desirest.

17 And it came to pass that when 
Aaron  had  said  these  words,  the 
king did a bow down before the Lord, 
upon  his  knees;  yea,  even  he  did
