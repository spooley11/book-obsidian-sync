33 And  now  the  king  said  that 
Alma  was  stirring  up  the  people 
to rebellion against him; therefore 
he sent his a army to destroy them.
34 And it came to pass that Alma 
and the people of the Lord were a ap-
prised of the coming of the king’s 
army; therefore they took their tents 
and  their  families  and  b departed 
into the wilderness.

35 And they were in number about

a four hundred and fifty souls.

CHAPTER 19

Gideon seeks to slay King Noah—The 
Lamanites invade the land—King Noah 
suffers death by fire—Limhi rules as a 
tributary monarch. About 145–121 b.c.
And it came to pass that the a army of 
the king returned, having searched 
in vain for the people of the Lord.
2 And now behold, the forces of 
the king were small, having been 
reduced, and there began to be a 
division  among  the  remainder  of 
the people.

3 And  the  lesser  part  began  to 
a breathe  out  threatenings  against 
the king, and there began to be a 
great contention among them.

4 And now there was a man among 
them whose name was Gideon, and 
he being a strong man and an en-
emy to the king, therefore he drew 
his sword, and swore in his wrath 
that he would slay the king.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
fought with the king; and when the 
king saw that he was about to over-
power him, he fled and ran and got 
upon the a tower which was near the  
temple.

6 And Gideon pursued after him 
and was about to get upon the tower 
to slay the king, and the king cast 
his eyes round about towards the 
land of a Shemlon, and behold, the 
army of the Lamanites were within 
the borders of the land.

7 And now the king cried out in the 
anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon, 
a spare  me,  for  the  Lamanites  are 
upon us, and they will destroy us; 
yea, they will destroy my people.

8 And  now  the  king  was  not  so 
much concerned about his people as
