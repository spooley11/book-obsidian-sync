25 And thus we see that the Lord 
did visit them in the fulness of his 
a wrath, and their wickedness and 
abominations had prepared a way 
for their everlasting destruction.

26 And it came to pass that Shiz 
did  pursue  Coriantumr  eastward, 
even to the borders by the seashore, 
and there he gave battle unto Shiz 
for the space of three days.

27 And so terrible was the destruc-
tion among the armies of Shiz that 
the people began to be frightened, 
and began to flee before the armies 
of Coriantumr; and they fled to the 
land of Corihor, and swept off the 
inhabitants before them, all them 
that would not join them.

28 And  they  pitched  their  tents 
in the valley of Corihor; and Cori-
antumr  pitched  his  tents  in  the 
valley of Shurr. Now the valley of 
Shurr  was  near  the  hill  Comnor;

wherefore, Coriantumr did gather 
his  armies  together  upon  the  hill 
Comnor, and did sound a trumpet 
unto  the  armies  of  Shiz  to  invite 
them forth to battle.

29 And it came to pass that they 
came forth, but were driven again; 
and they came the second time, and 
they were driven again the second 
time. And it came to pass that they 
came again the third time, and the 
battle became exceedingly sore.

30 And it came to pass that Shiz 
smote  upon  Coriantumr  that  he 
gave him many deep wounds; and 
Coriantumr, having lost his blood, 
fainted,  and  was  carried  away  as 
though he were dead.

31 Now  the  loss  of  men,  women 
and children on both sides was so 
great that Shiz commanded his peo-
ple that they should not pursue the 
armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, 
they returned to their camp.

CHAPTER 15

Millions  of  the  Jaredites  are  slain  in 
battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble 
all the people to mortal combat—The 
Spirit of the Lord ceases to strive with 
them—The  Jaredite  nation  is  utterly 
destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains.
