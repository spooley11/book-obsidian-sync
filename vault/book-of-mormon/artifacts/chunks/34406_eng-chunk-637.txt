had  overpowered  them  because 
of their much fatigue, which was 
caused  by  the  labors  and  heat  of 
the day.

34 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum  stole  privily  into  the  tent  of 
the king, and a put a javelin to his 
heart; and he did cause the b death 
of the king immediately that he did 
not awake his servants.

35 And he returned again privily 
to his own camp, and behold, his 
men  were  asleep,  and  he  awoke 
them and told them all the things 
that he had done.

36 And he caused that his armies 
should  stand  in  a readiness,  lest 
the Lamanites had awakened and 
should come upon them.

37 And thus endeth the twenty and 
fifth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi; and thus 
endeth the days of Amalickiah.

CHAPTER 52
Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah as king 
of the Lamanites—Moroni, Teancum, 
and Lehi lead the Nephites in a victo-
rious war against the Lamanites—The 
city of Mulek is retaken, and Jacob the 
Zoramite is slain. About 66–64 b.c.
And  now,  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
twenty and sixth year of the reign of 
the judges over the people of Nephi, 
behold, when the Lamanites awoke 
on  the  first  morning  of  the  first 
month, behold, they found Amal-
ickiah  was  dead  in  his  own  tent; 
and  they  also  saw  that  Teancum 
was a ready to give them battle on  
that day.

2 And now, when the Lamanites 
saw this they were affrighted; and 
they  abandoned  their  design  in 
marching into the land northward, 
and retreated with all their army 
into the city of a Mulek, and sought 
protection in their fortifications.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a brother  of  Amalickiah  was  ap-
pointed king over the people; and 
his name was b Ammoron; thus king 
Ammoron, the brother of king Amal-
ickiah,  was  appointed  to  reign  in 
his stead.
