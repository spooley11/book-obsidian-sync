6 And behold, the third time they 
did  understand  the  voice  which 
they heard; and it said unto them:
7 Behold  my  a Beloved  Son,  b in 
whom I am well pleased, in whom 
I  have  glorified  my  name—hear 
ye him.

8 And it came to pass, as they un-
derstood  they  cast  their  eyes  up 
again towards heaven; and behold, 
they  a saw  a  Man  b descending  out 
of heaven; and he was clothed in a 
white robe; and he came down and 
stood in the midst of them; and the 
eyes of the whole multitude were 
turned upon him, and they durst 
not open their mouths, even one to

another, and wist not what it meant, 
for they thought it was an angel that 
had appeared unto them.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
stretched forth his hand and spake 
unto the people, saying:

10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom 
the  prophets  testified  shall  come

heaven.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the

a Lord spake unto them saying:

14 Arise and come forth unto me, 
that  ye  may  a thrust  your  hands

know that I am the c God of Israel, 
and  the  God  of  the  whole  d earth, 
and have been slain for the sins of

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the
