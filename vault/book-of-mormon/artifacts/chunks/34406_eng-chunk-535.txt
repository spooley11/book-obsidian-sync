31 And  he  did  rise  up  in  great 
a swelling words before Alma, and 
did revile against the b priests and 
teachers, accusing them of leading  
away the people after the silly tradi-
tions of their fathers, for the sake of  
glutting on the labors of the people.
32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou 
knowest  that  we  do  not  glut  our-
selves upon the labors of this people; 
for behold I have a labored even from

ALMA 30  : 33–47

the commencement of the reign of 
the  judges  until  now,  with  mine 
b own hands for my support, notwith-
standing  my  many  travels  round 
about the land to declare the word 
of God unto my people.

33 And notwithstanding the many 
labors which I have performed in 
the church, I have never received 
so much as even one a senine for my 
labor; neither has any of my breth-
ren, save it were in the judgment-
seat;  and  then  we  have  received 
only according to law for our time.
34 And now, if we do not receive 
anything  for  our  labors  in  the 
church,  what  doth  it  profit  us  to 
labor in the church save it were to  
declare the truth, that we may have  
rejoicings in the a joy of our brethren?
35 Then why sayest thou that we 
preach unto this people to get gain, 
when thou, of thyself, knowest that 
we receive no gain? And now, be-
lievest  thou  that  we  deceive  this 
people,  that  a causes  such  joy  in 
their hearts?

36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.
37 And then Alma said unto him: 
Believest thou that there is a God?

38 And he answered, Nay.
39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye 
deny again that there is a God, and  
also deny the Christ? For behold, I 
say unto you, I know there is a God, 
and also that Christ shall come.
