CHAPTER 12
Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gath-
ering of Israel, and millennial judgment 
and peace—The proud and wicked will 
be brought low at the Second Coming—
Compare Isaiah 2. About 559–545 b.c.
a The  word  that  Isaiah,  the  son  of 
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and 
Jerusalem:

2 And it shall come to pass in the 
last days, a when the b mountain of 
the  Lord’s  c house  shall  be  estab-
lished in the top of the d mountains, 
and shall be exalted above the hills, 
and all nations shall flow unto it.

3 And many a people shall go and 
say, Come ye, and let us go up to 
the  b mountain of the Lord, to the 
c house of the God of Jacob; and he 
will teach us of his ways, and we 
will  d walk in his paths; for out of 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the 
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

4 And he shall a judge among the 
nations,  and  shall  rebuke  many 
people:  and  they  shall  beat  their

swords into plow-shares, and their 
spears into pruning-hooks—nation 
shall not lift up sword against na-
tion, neither shall they learn war 
any more.

5 O house of Jacob, come ye and let 
us walk in the light of the Lord; yea, 
come, for ye have all a gone astray, 
every one to his b wicked ways.

6 Therefore,  O  Lord,  thou  hast 
forsaken thy people, the house of 
Jacob, because they be replenished 
from  the  east,  and  hearken  unto 
a soothsayers  like  the  b Philistines, 
and they please themselves in the 
children of strangers.

7 Their land also is full of silver 
and gold, neither is there any end 
of their a treasures; their land is also 
full of horses, neither is there any 
end of their chariots.

8 Their land is also full of a idols; 
they worship the work of their own 
hands, that which their own fingers 
have made.

9 And the mean man a boweth b not 
down, and the great man humbleth 
himself not, therefore, forgive him 
not.

10 O ye wicked ones, enter into the 
rock, and a hide thee in the dust, for 
the fear of the Lord and the glory 
of his majesty shall smite thee.
