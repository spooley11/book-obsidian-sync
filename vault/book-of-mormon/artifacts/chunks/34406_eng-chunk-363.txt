30 And  also  that  king  Noah  and 
his priests had caused the people 
to commit so many sins and iniqui-
ties against God; and they also did 
mourn  for  the  a death  of  Abinadi; 
and also for the b departure of Alma 
and the people that went with him, 
who had formed a church of God 
through the strength and power of 
God, and faith on the words which 
had been spoken by Abinadi.

31 Yea, they did mourn for their de-
parture, for they knew not whither 
they had fled. Now they would have 
gladly joined with them, for they 
themselves had entered into a a cov-
enant with God to serve him and 
keep his commandments.

32 And now since the coming of 
Ammon,  king  Limhi  had  also  en-
tered into a covenant with God, and 
also  many  of  his  people,  to  serve 
him and keep his commandments.
33 And it came to pass that king 
Limhi and many of his people were 
desirous to be baptized; but there 
was none in the land that had a au-
thority from God. And Ammon de-
clined doing this thing, considering 
himself an unworthy servant.

34 Therefore they did not at that 
time form themselves into a a church, 
waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. 
Now they were desirous to become 
even as Alma and his brethren, who 
had fled into the wilderness.

35 They were desirous to be bap-
tized as a witness and a testimony 
that they were willing to serve God 
with all their hearts; nevertheless 
they did prolong the time; and an 
account of their baptism shall be 
a given hereafter.

36 And now all the study of Am-
mon  and  a his  people,  and  king 
Limhi  and  his  people,  was  to  de-
liver themselves out of the hands of 
the Lamanites and from b bondage.
