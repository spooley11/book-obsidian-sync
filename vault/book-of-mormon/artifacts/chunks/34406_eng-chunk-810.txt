17 But  thou,  when  thou  fastest, 
anoint thy head, and a wash thy face;
18 That  thou  appear  not  unto  
men to fast, but unto thy Father, who

19 Lay not up for yourselves trea-
sures upon earth, where a moth and 
rust doth corrupt, and thieves break 
through and steal;

20 But lay up for yourselves a trea-
sures in heaven, where neither moth 
nor rust doth corrupt, and where 
thieves do not break through nor 
steal.

22 The a light of the body is the b eye; 
if, therefore, thine eye be  c single,  
thy  whole  body  shall  be  full  of  
light.

23 But  if  thine  eye  be  evil,  thy 
whole  body  shall  be  full  of  dark-
ness. If, therefore, the light that is in 
thee be darkness, how great is that  
darkness!

for either he will hate the one and 
love the other, or else he will hold 
to  the  one  and  despise  the  other. 
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

spoken.  For  behold,  ye  are  they 
whom  I  have  chosen  to  b minister 
unto  this  people.  Therefore  I  say 
unto you, c take no thought for your 
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye
