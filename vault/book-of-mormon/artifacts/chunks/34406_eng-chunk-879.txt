21 And it came to pass that we did 
a fortify  the  city  of  Shem,  and  we 
did gather in our people as much 
as it were possible, that perhaps we 
might save them from destruction.
22 And it came to pass in the three 
hundred and forty and sixth year 
they began to come upon us again.
23 And it came to pass that I did 
speak unto my people, and did urge 
them with great energy, that they 
would stand boldly before the La-
manites and a fight for their b wives, 
and their children, and their houses, 
and their homes.

24 And my words did arouse them 
somewhat to vigor, insomuch that 
they did not flee from before the 
Lamanites, but did stand with bold-
ness against them.

25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
did contend with an army of thirty 
thousand against an army of fifty 
thousand. And it came to pass that 
we did stand before them with such 
firmness  that  they  did  flee  from 
before us.

26 And it came to pass that when 
they had fled we did pursue them

with our armies, and did meet them 
again, and did  a beat them; never-
theless  the  b strength  of  the  Lord 
was not with us; yea, we were left 
to ourselves, that the Spirit of the 
Lord did not abide in us; therefore 
we had become weak like unto our 
brethren.

27 And  my  heart  did  sorrow  be-
cause of this the great calamity of 
my people, because of their wick-
edness and their abominations. But 
behold, we did go forth against the 
Lamanites and the robbers of Gadi-
anton,  until  we  had  again  taken 
possession of the lands of our in-
heritance.

28 And  the  three  hundred  and 
forty  and  ninth  year  had  passed 
away. And in the three hundred and 
fiftieth year we made a treaty with 
the Lamanites and the robbers of 
Gadianton, in which we did get the 
lands of our inheritance divided.

29 And  the  Lamanites  did  give 
unto us the land a northward, yea, 
even to the b narrow passage which 
led into the land southward. And 
we did give unto the Lamanites all 
the land southward.
