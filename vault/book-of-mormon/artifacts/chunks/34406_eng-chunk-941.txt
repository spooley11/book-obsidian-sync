4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
father  did  build  up  many  cities 
upon the face of the land, and the 
people began again to spread over 
all the face of the land. And Shez 
did live to an exceedingly old age; 
and he begat Riplakish. And he died, 
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.
5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Rip-
lakish  did  not  do  that  which  was 
right in the sight of the Lord, for he 
did have many wives and  a concu-
bines, and did lay that upon men’s 
shoulders which was grievous to be 
borne; yea, he did b tax them with 
heavy taxes; and with the taxes he 
did build many spacious buildings.
6 And he did erect him an exceed-
ingly beautiful throne; and he did 
build  many  prisons,  and  whoso 
would not be subject unto taxes he 
did a cast into prison; and whoso was 
not  able  to  pay  taxes  he  did  cast 
into prison; and he did cause that 
they should labor continually for 
their  support;  and  whoso  refused 
to  labor  he  did  cause  to  be  put  
to death.

7 Wherefore he did obtain all his 
fine work, yea, even his fine a gold 
he did cause to be refined in prison;

and all manner of fine b workman-
ship  he  did  cause  to  be  wrought 
in prison. And it came to pass that 
he did afflict the people with his 
whoredoms and abominations.

8 And when he had reigned for the  
space of forty and two years the peo-
ple did rise up in rebellion against  
him;  and  there  began  to  be  war 
again  in  the  land,  insomuch  that 
Ripla kish was killed, and his descen-
dants were driven out of the land.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  after  the 
space of many years, Morianton, (he 
being  a  descendant  of  Riplakish) 
gathered together an army of out-
casts, and went forth and gave bat-
tle unto the people; and he gained 
power over many cities; and the war 
became exceedingly sore, and did 
last  for  the  space  of  many  years; 
and he did gain power over all the 
land, and did establish himself king  
over all the land.
