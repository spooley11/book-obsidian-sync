10 But  if  he  a murdered  he  was 
punished  unto  b death;  and  if  he 
c robbed he was also punished; and 
if  he  stole  he  was  also  punished; 
and if he committed  d adultery he 
was also punished; yea, for all this 
wickedness they were punished.

11 For there was a law that men 
should be judged according to their 
crimes. Nevertheless, there was no 
law against a man’s belief; therefore, 
a man was punished only for the 
crimes which he had done; therefore 
all men were on a equal grounds.

12 And  this  a Anti-Christ,  whose 
name  was  Korihor,  (and  the  law 
could have no hold upon him) be-
gan to preach unto the people that 
there should be b no Christ. And after 
this manner did he preach, saying:
13 O ye that are bound down un-
der a a foolish and a vain hope, why 
do  ye  yoke  yourselves  with  such 
foolish things? Why do ye look for 
a Christ? For no man can b know of 
anything which is to come.

14 Behold, these things which ye

call  prophecies,  which  ye  say  are 
handed  down  by  holy  prophets, 
behold, they are foolish traditions 
of your fathers.

15 How do ye know of their surety ? 
Behold, ye cannot know of things 
which ye do not a see; therefore ye 
cannot know that there shall be a 
Christ.

16 Ye  look  forward  and  say  that 
ye see a remission of your sins. But 
behold, it is the effect of a a frenzied 
mind; and this derangement of your 
minds comes because of the tradi-
tions  of  your  fathers,  which  lead 
you  away  into  a  belief  of  things 
which are not so.

17 And  many  more  such  things 
did he say unto them, telling them 
that there could be no atonement 
made for the sins of men, but every 
man a fared in this life according to 
the  management  of  the  creature; 
therefore  every  man  prospered 
according  to  his  genius,  and  that 
every  man  conquered  according 
to his strength; and b whatsoever a 
man did was c no crime.

18 And  thus  he  did  preach  unto 
them,  leading  away  the  hearts  of 
many, causing them to lift up their 
heads in their wickedness, yea, lead-
ing  away  many  women,  and  also 
men, to commit whoredoms—telling 
them that when a man was dead, 
that was the end thereof.
