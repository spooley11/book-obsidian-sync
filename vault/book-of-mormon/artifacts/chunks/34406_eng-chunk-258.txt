74 And  thus  they  labored,  with 
all diligence, according to the com-
mandments of the Lord of the vine-
yard, even until the bad had been 
cast away out of the vineyard, and 
the Lord had preserved unto himself  
that the trees had become again the 
natural fruit; and they became like 
unto a one body; and the fruits were 
equal; and the Lord of the vineyard 
had preserved unto himself the natu-
ral fruit, which was most precious 
unto him from the beginning.

75 And it came to pass that when 
the a Lord of the vineyard saw that 
his  fruit  was  good,  and  that  his 
vineyard was no more corrupt, he 
called up his servants, and said unto 
them: Behold, for this last time have 
we  nourished  my  vineyard;  and 
thou  beholdest  that  I  have  done 
according  to  my  will;  and  I  have 
preserved the natural fruit, that it

is good, even like as it was in the 
beginning. And  b blessed art thou; 
for because ye have been diligent in 
laboring with me in my vineyard, 
and have kept my commandments, 
and  have  brought  unto  me  again 
the c natural fruit, that my vineyard 
is no more corrupted, and the bad 
is cast away, behold ye shall have 
d joy with me because of the fruit 
of my vineyard.

76 For behold, for a a long time will 
I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard 
unto mine own self against the sea-
son, which speedily cometh; and for 
the last time have I nourished my 
vineyard, and pruned it, and dug 
about it, and dunged it; wherefore 
I will lay up unto mine own self of 
the fruit, for a long time, according 
to that which I have spoken.
