in the earth.

plates the  a very things which the 
brother of Jared saw; and there never 
were  b greater  things  made  mani-
fest  than  those  which  were  made  
manifest unto the brother of Jared.

manded me to write them; and I have 
written them. And he commanded

me  that  I  should  a seal  them  up; 
and he also hath commanded that 
I should seal up the interpretation 
thereof; wherefore I have sealed up 
the b interpreters, according to the 
commandment of the Lord.

shall not go forth unto the Gentiles 
until the day that they shall repent 
of their iniquity, and become clean 
before the Lord.

exercise a faith in me, saith the Lord, 
even as the brother of Jared did, that 
they may become b sanctified in me,

things which the brother of Jared 
saw,  even  to  the  unfolding  unto 
them all my d revelations, saith Jesus  
Christ, the Son of God, the e Father 
of the heavens and of the earth, and 
all things that in them are.
