even as long as any of our posterity 
remains upon the face of the land.
33 And many more things did king 
Mosiah write unto them, unfolding 
unto them all the trials and a trou-
bles of a righteous king, yea, all the 
travails of soul for their people, and 
also all the murmurings of the peo-
ple to their king; and he explained 
it all unto them.

34 And  he  told  them  that  these 
things  ought  not  to  be;  but  that 
the burden should come upon all 
the people, that every man might 
a bear his part.

35 And he also unfolded unto them 
all the disadvantages they labored 
under,  by  having  an  unrighteous 
a king to rule over them;

36 Yea,  all  a his  iniquities  and 
abominations, and all the wars, and 
contentions, and bloodshed, and the 
stealing, and the plundering, and 
the committing of whoredoms, and 
all manner of iniquities which can-
not  be  enumerated—telling  them 
that these things ought not to be, 
that they were expressly repugnant 
to the commandments of God.

37 And now it came to pass, after 
king Mosiah had sent these things 
forth among the people they were 
a convinced of the truth of his words.
38 Therefore  they  relinquished 
their desires for a king, and became 
exceedingly  anxious  that  every 
man should have an equal a chance 
throughout  all  the  land;  yea,  and 
every man expressed a willingness 
to answer for his own sins.

39 Therefore, it came to pass that 
they assembled themselves together 
in bodies throughout the land, to 
cast in their a voices concerning who 
should  be  their  b judges,  to  judge 
them according to the c law which 
had been given them; and they were
