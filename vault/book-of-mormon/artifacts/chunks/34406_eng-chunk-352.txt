MOSIAH 18  : 28–19  : 8

little  should  be  required;  and  to 
him that had not should be given.
28 And  thus  they  should  impart 
of  their  a substance  of  their  own 
free will and good desires towards 
God, and to those priests that stood 
in  need,  yea,  and  to  every  needy, 
naked soul.

29 And  this  he  said  unto  them, 
having  been  commanded  of  God; 
and they did a walk uprightly before 
God, imparting to one another both 
temporally and spiritually accord-
ing to their needs and their wants.
30 And now it came to pass that all 
this was done in Mormon, yea, by  
the a waters of Mormon, in the forest 
that was near the waters of Mor mon; 
yea, the place of Mormon, the waters  
of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, 
how beautiful are they to the eyes 
of  them  who  there  came  to  the 
knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, 
and how blessed are they, for they 
shall b sing to his praise forever.

31 And these things were done in 
the a borders of the land, that they 
might not come to the knowledge 
of the king.

32 But behold, it came to pass that 
the king, having discovered a move-
ment  among  the  people,  sent  his 
servants to watch them. Therefore 
on the day that they were assem-
bling themselves together to hear 
the word of the Lord they were dis-
covered unto the king.
