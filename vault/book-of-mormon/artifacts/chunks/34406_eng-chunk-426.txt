2 And even I could not have come 
now  at  this  time  were  it  not  that 
the judgment-seat hath been a given 
to  another,  to  reign  in  my  stead; 
and the Lord in much mercy hath 
granted that I should come unto you.
3 And behold, I have come having 
great hopes and much desire that 
I should find that ye had humbled 
yourselves before God, and that ye 
had continued in the supplicating 
of his grace, that I should find that 
ye were blameless before him, that I 
should find that ye were not in the 
awful a dilemma that our brethren 
were in at Zarahemla.

4 But blessed be the name of God, 
that he hath given me to know, yea, 
hath given unto me the exceedingly 
great joy of knowing that they are 
established again in the way of his 
righteousness.

5 And  I  trust,  according  to  the 
Spirit of God which is in me, that I 
shall also have joy over you; never-
theless I do not desire that my joy 
over you should come by the cause

of so much afflictions and sorrow 
which I have had for the brethren 
at  Zarahemla,  for  behold,  my  joy 
cometh  over  them  after  wading 
through much affliction and sorrow.
6 But  behold,  I  trust  that  ye  are 
not in a state of so much unbelief 
as were your brethren; I trust that 
ye  are  not  lifted  up  in  the  pride 
of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye 
have not set your hearts upon riches 
and the vain things of the world; 
yea, I trust that you do not worship 
a idols, but that ye do worship the 
true and the b living God, and that 
ye look forward for the remission 
of  your  sins,  with  an  everlasting 
faith, which is to come.

7 For behold, I say unto you there 
be  many  things  to  come;  and  be-
hold,  there  is  one  thing  which  is 
of more importance than they all—
for behold, the a time is not far dis-
tant that the Redeemer liveth and 
cometh among his people.
