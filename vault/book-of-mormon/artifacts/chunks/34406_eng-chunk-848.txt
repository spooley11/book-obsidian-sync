5 And  I  will  come  a near  to  you 
to judgment; and I will be a swift 
witness against the b sorcerers, and 
against the adulterers, and against 
false  c swearers,  and  against  those 
that  d oppress  the  hireling  in  his 
wages, the widow and the e father-
less, and that turn aside the f stranger, 
and  fear  not  me,  saith  the  Lord  
of Hosts.

6 For a I am the Lord, I change not; 
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not 
consumed.

7 Even  from  the  days  of  your 
fathers ye are gone away from mine 
a ordinances,  and  have  not  kept 
them. b Return unto me and I will 
return unto you, saith the Lord of 
Hosts.  But  ye  say:  Wherein  shall  
we return?

8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have 
robbed  me.  But  ye  say:  Wherein 
have  we  robbed  thee?  In  a tithes 
and b offerings.

9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for 
ye have robbed me, even this whole 
nation.

10 Bring  ye  all  the  a tithes  into

the storehouse, that there may be 
b meat in my house; and prove me 
now  herewith,  saith  the  Lord  of 
Hosts,  if  I  will  not  open  you  the 
c windows of heaven, and pour you 
out a d blessing that there shall not 
be room enough to receive it.

11 And I will rebuke the a devourer 
for  your  sakes,  and  he  shall  not  
destroy the fruits of your ground; 
neither  shall  your  vine  cast  her 
fruit before the time in the fields, 
saith the Lord of Hosts.

12 And all nations shall call you  
blessed,  for  ye  shall  be  a  de-
lightsome  land,  saith  the  Lord  of  
Hosts.

13 Your  words  have  been  stout 
against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye 
say: What have we spoken against 
thee?

14 Ye have a said: It is b vain to serve 
God, and what doth it profit that 
we have kept his  c ordinances and 
that  we  have  walked  mournfully 
before the Lord of Hosts?

15 And  now  we  call  the  proud 
happy; yea, they that work wicked-
ness are set up; yea, they that tempt 
God are even delivered.
