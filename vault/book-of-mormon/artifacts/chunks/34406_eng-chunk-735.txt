leaders, that they would say unto 
Nephi: Behold, we know that thou 
art  a  man  of  God,  and  therefore 
cry unto the Lord our God that he 
turn away from us this famine, lest 
all the words which thou hast spo-
ken  concerning  our  b destruction 
be fulfilled.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judges did say unto Nephi, accord-
ing to the words which had been 
desired.  And  it  came  to  pass  that 
when  Nephi  saw  that  the  people 
had  a repented  and  did  humble 
themselves  in  sackcloth,  he  cried 
again unto the Lord, saying:

10 O Lord, behold this people re-
penteth; and they have swept away 
the band of Gadianton from amongst 
them insomuch that they have be-

11 Now,  O  Lord,  because  of  this

that she may bring forth her fruit, 
and her grain in the season of grain.
14 O Lord, thou didst hearken unto 
a my words when I said, Let there 
be a famine, that the pestilence of 
the sword might cease; and I know 
that  thou  wilt,  even  at  this  time,
