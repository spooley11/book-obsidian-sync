27 And  a wo unto them that seek 
deep to hide their b counsel from the 
Lord!  And  their  works  are  in  the 
c dark; and they say: Who seeth us, 
and who knoweth us? And they also 
say: Surely, your turning of things 
upside down shall be esteemed as 
the d potter’s clay. But behold, I will 
show unto them, saith the Lord of 
Hosts, that I e know all their works. 
For shall the work say of him that 
made it, he made me not? Or shall 
the  thing  framed  say  of  him  that 
framed it, he had no understanding?
28 But  behold,  saith  the  Lord  of 
Hosts: I will show unto the children 
of  men  that  it  is  yet  a  very  little 
while and Lebanon shall be turned 
into a fruitful field; and the a fruitful 
field shall be esteemed as a forest.
29 a And in that day shall the b deaf

hear  the  words  of  the  book,  and 
the eyes of the blind shall see out 
of obscurity and out of darkness.

30 And  the  a meek  also  shall  in-
crease, and their b joy shall be in the 
Lord, and the poor among men shall 
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

31 For assuredly as the Lord liv-
eth they shall see that the a terrible 
one is brought to naught, and the 
scorner is consumed, and all that 
watch for iniquity are cut off;

32 And they that make a man an 
a offender for a word, and lay a snare 
for him that reproveth in the b gate, 
and c turn aside the just for a thing 
of naught.

33 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, 
who redeemed Abraham, concern-
ing the house of Jacob: Jacob shall 
a not now be ashamed, neither shall 
his face now wax pale.

34 But when he a seeth his children, 
the work of my hands, in the midst 
of him, they shall sanctify my name, 
and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, 
and shall fear the God of Israel.

35 They  also  that  a erred  in  spirit 
shall come to understanding, and they  
that murmured shall b learn doctrine.
