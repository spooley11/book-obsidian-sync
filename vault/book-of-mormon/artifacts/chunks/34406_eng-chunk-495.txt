28 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  Lamoni  proceeded  on 
their journey towards the land of 
Middoni. And Lamoni found favor 
in the eyes of the king of the land; 
therefore the brethren of Ammon 
were brought forth out of prison.

29 And  when  Ammon  did  meet 
them he was exceedingly sorrowful, 
for  behold  they  were  naked,  and 
their skins were worn exceedingly 
because of being bound with strong 
cords. And they also had a suffered 
hunger, thirst, and all kinds of af-
flictions;  nevertheless  they  were 
b patient in all their sufferings.

30 And, as it happened, it was their  
lot to have fallen into the hands of  
a more hardened and a more a stiff-
necked people; therefore they would 
not hearken unto their words, and

they  had  cast  them  out,  and  had 
smitten them, and had driven them 
from  house  to  house,  and  from 
place to place, even until they had 
arrived in the land of Middoni; and 
there they were taken and cast into 
prison,  and  bound  with  b strong 
cords, and kept in prison for many 
days, and were delivered by La moni 
and Ammon.

Aaron, and Muloki, and their breth-

Comprising chapters 21 through 25.

CHAPTER 21

Aaron  teaches  the  Amalekites  about 
Christ  and  His  Atonement—Aaron 
and  his  brethren  are  imprisoned  in 
Middoni—After their deliverance, they 
teach in the synagogues and make many 
converts—Lamoni grants religious free-
dom to the people in the land of Ishmael. 
About 90–77 b.c.
Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren  a separated  themselves  in  the 
borders of the land of the Laman-
ites, behold Aaron took his journey 
towards the land which was called 
by the Lamanites, b Jerusalem, call-
ing it after the land of their fathers’ 
nativity;  and  it  was  away  joining 
the borders of Mormon.

2 Now  the  Lamanites  and  the 
Amalekites and the people of a Amu-
lon  had  built  a  great  city,  which 
was called Jerusalem.

3 Now the Lamanites of themselves 
were  sufficiently  hardened,  but  
the Amalekites and the Amulonites 
were  still  harder;  therefore  they 
did cause the Lamanites that they 
should  harden  their  hearts,  that  
they should wax strong in wicked-
ness and their abominations.

4 And it came to pass that Aaron 
came to the city of Jerusalem, and
