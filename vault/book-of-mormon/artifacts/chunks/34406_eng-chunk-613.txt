CHAPTER 47
Amalickiah  uses  treachery,  murder, 
and intrigue to become king of the La-
manites—The  Nephite  dissenters  are 
more  wicked  and  ferocious  than  the 
Lamanites. About 72 b.c.
Now we will return in our record 
to Amalickiah and those who had 
a fled with him into the wilderness; 
for, behold, he had taken those who 
went with him, and went up in the 
b land of Nephi among the Laman-
ites, and did c stir up the Lamanites  
to  anger  against  the  people  of 
Nephi, insomuch that the king of 
the Lamanites sent a proclamation 
throughout all his land, among all 
his people, that they should gather 
themselves together again to go to 
battle against the Nephites.

2 And it came to pass that when 
the  proclamation  had  gone  forth 
among them they were exceedingly 
afraid; yea, they a feared to displease 
the king, and they also feared to go 
to battle against the Nephites lest 
they should lose their lives. And it 
came to pass that they would not, 
or  the  more  part  of  them  would 
not,  obey  the  commandments  of  
the king.

3 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that

the  king  was  wroth  because  of 
their  disobedience;  therefore  he 
gave Amalickiah the command of 
that  part  of  his  army  which  was 
obedient unto his commands, and 
commanded him that he should go 
forth and a compel them to arms.
