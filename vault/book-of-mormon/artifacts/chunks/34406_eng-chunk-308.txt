ass which belongeth to his neigh-
bor, and keep him? I say unto you, 
Nay; he will not even suffer that he 
shall feed among his flocks, but will 
drive him away, and cast him out. 
I say unto you, that even so shall it 
be among you if ye know not the 
name by which ye are called.

be steadfast and immovable, always  
abounding  in  a good  works,  that

CHAPTER 6

King  Benjamin  records  the  names  of 
the people and appoints priests to teach 
them—Mosiah  reigns  as  a  righteous 
king. About 124–121 b.c.
And now, king Benjamin thought 
it was expedient, after having fin-
ished speaking to the people, that 
he  should  a take  the  names  of  all 
those who had entered into a cov-
enant  with  God  to  keep  his  com-
mandments.

2 And it came to pass that there 
was not one soul, except it were little 
children, but who had entered into 
the covenant and had taken upon 
them the name of Christ.
