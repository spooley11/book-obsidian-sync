24 And they saw that they had be-
come a weak, like unto their brethren,  
the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of 
the Lord did no more preserve them; 
yea, it had withdrawn from them 
because the Spirit of the Lord doth 
not b dwell in c unholy d temples—

25 Therefore the Lord did cease to 
preserve them by his miraculous and 
matchless power, for they had fallen 
into a state of a unbelief and awful 
wickedness; and they saw that the 
Lamanites were exceedingly more 
numerous than they, and except they 
should b cleave unto the Lord their  
God they must unavoidably perish.
26 For behold, they saw that the 
strength  of  the  Lamanites  was  as

CHAPTER 5
Nephi  and  Lehi  devote  themselves  to 
preaching—Their names invite them to 
pattern their lives after their forebears—
Christ  redeems  those  who  repent—
Nephi and Lehi make many converts 
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles 
them—A cloud of darkness overshad-
ows three hundred people—The earth 
shakes, and a voice commands men to 
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with 
angels, and the multitude is encircled 
by fire. About 30 b.c.
And it came to pass that in this same 
year, behold, a Nephi b delivered up 
the judgment-seat to a man whose 
name was c Cezoram.
