MOSIAH 23  : 39–24  : 13

39 And the king of the Lamanites 
had granted unto Amulon that he 
should be a king and a ruler over 
his  people,  who  were  in  the  land 
of  Helam;  nevertheless  he  should 
have no power to do anything con-
trary to the will of the king of the 
Lamanites.

CHAPTER 24
Amulon persecutes Alma and his peo-
ple—They are to be put to death if they 
pray—The Lord makes their burdens 
seem  light—He  delivers  them  from 
bondage, and they return to Zarahemla. 
About 145–120 b.c.
And it came to pass that Amulon 
did  gain  favor  in  the  eyes  of  the 
king  of  the  Lamanites;  therefore, 
the king of the Lamanites granted 
unto him and his brethren that they 
should be appointed teachers over 
his people, yea, even over the people 
who were in the land of Shemlon, 
and in the land of Shilom, and in 
the a land of Amulon.

2 For the Lamanites had taken pos-
session of all these lands; therefore, 
the king of the Lamanites had ap-
pointed kings over all these lands.
3 And now the name of the king 
of the Lamanites was a Laman, be-
ing  called  after  the  name  of  his 
father; and therefore he was called 
king Laman. And he was king over 
a numerous people.

4 And he appointed  a teachers of 
the b brethren of Amulon in every 
land  which  was  possessed  by  his 
people; and thus the  c language of 
Nephi began to be taught among all 
the people of the Lamanites.

5 And they were a people friendly 
one  with  another;  nevertheless 
they knew not God; neither did the 
brethren  of  Amulon  teach  them 
anything concerning the Lord their

God, neither the law of Moses; nor 
did they teach them the words of  
Abinadi;

6 But they taught them that they 
should keep their record, and that 
they might write one to another.

7 And thus the Lamanites began 
to increase in riches, and began to 
a trade  one  with  another  and  wax 
great, and began to be a cunning 
and a wise people, as to the wisdom 
of the world, yea, a very cunning 
people, delighting in all manner of 
wickedness and plunder, except it 
were among their own brethren.
