14 And now, whoso readeth, let him 
understand; he that hath the scrip-
tures, let him a search them, and see 
and behold if all these deaths and  
destructions by fire, and by smoke, 
and  by  b tempests,  and  by  whirl-
winds, and by the c opening of the 
earth to receive them, and all these 
things  are  not  unto  the  fulfilling 
of  the  prophecies  of  many  of  the  
holy prophets.

15 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Yea, 
many have testified of these things 
at the coming of Christ, and were 
a slain because they testified of these  
things.

16 Yea,  the  prophet  a Zenos  did 
testify  of  these  things,  and  also 
Zenock  spake  b concerning  these 
things, because they testified par-
ticularly concerning us, who are the  
remnant of their seed.

17 Behold,  our  father  Jacob  also 
testified concerning a a remnant of 
the seed of Joseph. And behold, are  
not  we  a  remnant  of  the  seed  of  
Joseph? And these things which tes-
tify of us, are they not written upon 
the plates of brass which our father 
Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

18 And it came to pass that in the 
ending of the thirty and fourth year, 
behold, I will show unto you that the 
people of Nephi who were spared, 
and also those who had been called

a Lamanites, who had been spared, 
did have great favors shown unto 
them, and great b blessings poured 
out upon their heads, insomuch that 
soon after the c ascension of Christ 
into heaven he did truly manifest 
himself unto them—

19 a Showing his body unto them, 
and  ministering  unto  them;  and 
an account of his ministry shall be 
given hereafter. Therefore for this 
time I make an end of my sayings.

Jesus Christ did show himself unto 
the people of Nephi, as the multi-
tude were gathered together in the 
land  Bountiful,  and  did  minister 
unto them; and on this wise did he 
show himself unto them.
