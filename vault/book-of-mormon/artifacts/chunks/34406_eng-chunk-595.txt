22 Behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  they  durst  not  come  against 
the Nephites in the borders of Jer-
shon; therefore they departed out 
of the land of Antionum into the 
wilderness, and took their journey 
round about in the wilderness, away 
by the head of the river Sidon, that 
they might come into the land of 
a Manti and take possession of the 
land; for they did not suppose that 
the armies of Moroni would know 
whither they had gone.

23 But it came to pass, as soon as 
they had departed into the wilder-
ness Moroni sent spies into the wil-
derness to watch their camp; and 
Moroni, also, knowing of the prophe-
cies of Alma, sent certain men unto 
him,  desiring  him  that  he  should 
a inquire of the Lord  b whither the 
armies  of  the  Nephites  should  go 
to  defend  themselves  against  the 
Lamanites.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a word of the Lord came unto Alma, 
and Alma informed the messengers 
of  Moroni,  that  the  armies  of  the

Lamanites  were  marching  round 
about in the wilderness, that they 
might come over into the land of 
Manti, that they might commence 
an attack upon the weaker part of 
the people. And those messengers 
went  and  delivered  the  message 
unto Moroni.

25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of 
his  army  in  the  land  of  Jershon, 
lest  by  any  means  a  part  of  the 
Lamanites  should  come  into  that 
land and take possession of the city, 
took the remaining part of his army 
and  marched  over  into  the  land  
of Manti.
