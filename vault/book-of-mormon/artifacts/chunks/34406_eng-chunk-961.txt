And it came to pass when Corian-
tumr had recovered of his wounds, 
he began to remember the a words 
which Ether had spoken unto him.
2 He  saw  that  there  had  been 
slain by the sword already nearly 
a two millions of his people, and he 
began to sorrow in his heart; yea, 
there had been slain two millions 
of mighty men, and also their wives 
and their children.

3 He began to repent of the evil 
which  he  had  done;  he  began  to 
remember  the  words  which  had 
been  spoken  by  the  mouth  of  all 
the prophets, and he saw them that 
they were fulfilled thus far, every 
whit;  and  his  soul  a mourned  and 
refused to be b comforted.

4 And it came to pass that he wrote 
an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him 
that he would spare the people, and 
he would give up the kingdom for 
the sake of the lives of the people.
5 And it came to pass that when 
Shiz  had  received  his  epistle  he 
wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, 
that  if  he  would  give  himself  up, 
that he might slay him with his own 
sword, that he would spare the lives  
of the people.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people repented not of their iniq-
uity; and the people of Coriantumr 
were stirred up to anger against the  
people of Shiz; and the people of  
Shiz were stirred up to anger against 
the people of Coriantumr; where-
fore, the people of Shiz did give bat-
tle unto the people of Coriantumr.
7 And when Coriantumr saw that 
he was about to fall he fled again 
before the people of Shiz.

8 And it came to pass that he came 
to the waters of Ripliancum, which, 
by  interpretation,  is  large,  or  to 
exceed  all;  wherefore,  when  they 
came to these waters they pitched 
their  tents;  and  Shiz  also  pitched 
his tents near unto them; and there-
fore on the morrow they did come  
to battle.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
fought an exceedingly sore battle, 
in which Coriantumr was wounded 
again, and he fainted with the loss 
of blood.
