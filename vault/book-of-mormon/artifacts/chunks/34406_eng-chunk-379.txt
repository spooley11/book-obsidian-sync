MOSIAH 26  : 24–39

unto  the  end  a  place  at  my  right 
hand.

24 For behold, in my name are they 
called; and if they a know me they 
shall come forth, and shall have a 
place eternally at my right hand.

25 And it shall come to pass that 
when the a second trump shall sound 
then  shall  they  that  never  b knew 
me come forth and shall stand be-
fore me.

26 And then shall they know that 
I am the Lord their God, that I am 
their Redeemer; but they would not 
be redeemed.

27 And  then  I  will  confess  unto 
them that I never a knew them; and 
they shall b depart into c everlasting 
fire prepared for the devil and his 
angels.

28 Therefore I say unto you, that 
he that will not a hear my voice, the 
same shall ye not receive into my 
church, for him I will not receive 
at the last day.

29 Therefore I say unto you, Go; 
and whosoever transgresseth against 
me, him shall ye a judge b according 
to the sins which he has commit-
ted; and if he c confess his sins be-
fore  thee  and  me,  and  d repenteth 
in  the  sincerity  of  his  heart,  him 
shall ye e forgive, and I will forgive  
him also.

30 Yea, and a as often as my people 
b repent  will  I  forgive  them  their 
trespasses against me.

31 And ye shall also a forgive one 
another your trespasses; for verily 
I  say  unto  you,  he  that  forgiveth 
not his b neighbor’s trespasses when 
he says that he repents, the same

hath  brought  himself  under  con-
demnation.

32 Now  I  say  unto  you,  Go;  and 
whosoever will  a not repent of his 
sins the same shall not be numbered 
among my people; and this shall be 
observed from this time forward.

33 And it came to pass when Alma 
had  heard  these  words  he  a wrote 
them  down  that  he  might  have 
them, and that he might judge the 
people of that church according to 
the commandments of God.

34 And it came to pass that Alma 
went  and  judged  those  that  had 
been taken in iniquity, according 
to the a word of the Lord.
