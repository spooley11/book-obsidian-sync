42 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did not pursue us far before they 
halted; and it was in the morning of 
the third day of the seventh month.
43 And  now,  whether  they  were 
overtaken by Antipus we knew not, 
but I said unto my men: Behold, we 
know not but they have halted for 
the purpose that we should come 
against them, that they might catch 
us in their snare;

44 Therefore what say ye, my sons,

will ye go against them to battle?

45 And  now  I  say  unto  you,  my 
beloved brother Moroni, that never 
had I seen a so great b courage, nay, 
not amongst all the Nephites.

46 For as I had ever called them 
my sons (for they were all of them 
very young) even so they said unto 
me: Father, behold our God is with  
us, and he will a not suffer that we  
should  fall;  then  let  us  go  forth;  
we would not slay our brethren if 
they would let us alone; therefore 
let us go, lest they should overpower 
the army of Antipus.

47 Now  they  never  had  fought, 
yet  they  did  not  fear  death;  and 
they  did  think  more  upon  the 
a liberty of their b fathers than they 
did upon their lives; yea, they had

been taught by their c mothers, that 
if they did not doubt, God would 
deliver them.

48 And  they  rehearsed  unto  me 
the  words  of  their  a mothers,  say-
ing: We b do not doubt our mothers  
knew it.

49 And it came to pass that I did re-
turn with my two thousand against 
these Lamanites who had pursued 
us. And now behold, the armies of 
Antipus had overtaken them, and 
a terrible battle had commenced.

50 The  army  of  Antipus  being 
weary, because of their long march 
in  so  short  a  space  of  time,  were 
about to fall into the hands of the 
Lamanites; and had I not returned 
with my two thousand they would 
have obtained their purpose.
