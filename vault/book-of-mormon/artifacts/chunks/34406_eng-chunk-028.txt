24 And I also spake unto him that I 
should carry the engravings, which 
were upon the  a plates of brass, to 
my elder brethren, who were with-
out the walls.

25 And  I  also  bade  him  that  he

should follow me.

26 And he, supposing that I spake 
of the a brethren of the b church, and 
that I was truly that Laban whom 
I had slain, wherefore he did fol-
low me.

27 And  he  spake  unto  me  many 
times concerning the elders of the 
Jews, as I went forth unto my breth-
ren, who were without the walls.

28 And it came to pass that when 
Laman saw me he was exceedingly 
frightened,  and  also  Lemuel  and 
Sam.  And  they  fled  from  before 
my presence; for they supposed it 
was Laban, and that he had slain 
me  and  had  sought  to  take  away 
their lives also.

29 And it came to pass that I called

after them, and they did hear me; 
wherefore  they  did  cease  to  flee 
from my presence.

30 And it came to pass that when 
the  servant  of  Laban  beheld  my 
brethren he began to tremble, and 
was about to flee from before me 
and return to the city of Jerusalem.
31 And now I, Nephi, being a man 
large in stature, and also having re-
ceived much a strength of the Lord, 
therefore I did seize upon the ser-
vant of Laban, and held him, that 
he should not flee.

32 And it came to pass that I spake 
with him, that if he would hearken 
unto my words, as the Lord liveth, 
and as I live, even so that if he would 
hearken unto our words, we would 
spare his life.

33 And  I  spake  unto  him,  even 
with an a oath, that he need not fear; 
that he should be a b free man like 
unto us if he would go down in the 
wilderness with us.

34 And  I  also  spake  unto  him, 
saying: Surely the Lord hath a com-
manded us to do this thing; and shall 
we not be diligent in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord? There-
fore, if thou wilt go down into the 
wilderness to my father thou shalt 
have place with us.
