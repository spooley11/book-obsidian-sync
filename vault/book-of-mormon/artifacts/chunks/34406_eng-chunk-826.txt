15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye 
must watch and a pray always, lest 
ye be tempted by the devil, and ye 
be led away captive by him.

16 And  as  I  have  prayed  among 
you  even  so  shall  ye  pray  in  my 
a church,  among  my  people  who 
do repent and are baptized in my 
name. Behold I am the b light; I have 
set an c example for you.

17 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had spoken these words unto 
his disciples, he turned again unto 
the multitude and said unto them:
18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto 
you, ye must watch and pray always 
lest  ye  enter  into  temptation;  for 
a Satan  desireth  to  have  you,  that 
he may sift you as wheat.

19 Therefore ye must always pray

unto the Father in my name;

20 And  a whatsoever  ye  shall  ask 
the  Father  in  my  name,  which  is 
right, believing that ye shall receive, 
behold it shall be given unto you.
21 a Pray in your families unto the 
Father,  always  in  my  name,  that 
your wives and your children may 
be blessed.

22 And behold, ye shall a meet to-
gether oft; and ye shall not forbid 
any  man  from  coming  unto  you 
when  ye  shall  meet  together,  but 
suffer  them  that  they  may  come 
unto you and forbid them not;

23 But ye shall a pray for them, and 
shall not cast them out; and if it so 
be that they come unto you oft ye 
shall pray for them unto the Father, 
in my name.

24 Therefore, hold up your a light

that it may shine unto the world. 
Behold  I  am  the  b light  which  ye 
shall hold up—that which ye have 
seen  me  do.  Behold  ye  see  that  I 
have prayed unto the Father, and 
ye all have witnessed.

25 And  ye  see  that  I  have  com-
manded that a none of you should go 
away, but rather have commanded 
that ye should come unto me, that 
ye might b feel and see; even so shall 
ye do unto the world; and whoso-
ever breaketh this commandment 
suffereth  himself  to  be  led  into 
temptation.

26 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words, 
he turned his eyes again upon the 
a disciples whom he had chosen, and 
said unto them:
