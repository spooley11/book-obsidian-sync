11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert 
the ways of the Lord in very many 
instances; therefore, for this cause, 
Alma and his brethren went into 
the land to preach the word unto 
them.

12 Now, when they had come into 
the land, behold, to their astonish-
ment they found that the Zoram-
ites had built synagogues, and that 
they did gather themselves together 
on one day of the week, which day 
they did call the day of the Lord; 
and they did a worship after a man-
ner which Alma and his brethren 
had never beheld;

13 For they had a place built up 
in the center of their synagogue, a 
place for standing, which was high 
above the head; and the top thereof 
would only admit one person.

14 Therefore, whosoever desired to 
a worship must go forth and stand 
upon the top thereof, and stretch 
forth  his  hands  towards  heaven, 
and cry with a loud voice, saying:
15 Holy, holy God; we believe that  
thou  art  God,  and  we  believe  
that  thou  art  holy,  and  that  thou 
wast a  a spirit, and that thou art a 
spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit 
forever.

16 Holy God, we believe that thou 
hast separated us from our breth-
ren; and we do not believe in the 
tradition  of  our  brethren,  which 
was handed down to them by the 
childishness of their fathers; but we 
believe that thou hast  a elected us 
to be thy  b holy children; and also 
thou hast made it known unto us 
that c there shall be d no Christ.

17 But thou art the same yesterday, 
today, and forever; and thou hast 
a elected us that we shall be saved, 
whilst all around us are elected to 
be cast by thy wrath down to hell; 
for  the  which  holiness,  O  God, 
we thank thee; and we also thank 
thee that thou hast elected us, that 
we may not be led away after the 
foolish traditions of our brethren, 
which doth b bind them down to a 
belief  of  Christ,  which  doth  lead 
their hearts to wander far from thee,  
our God.

18 And  again  we  thank  thee,  O 
God,  that  we  are  a  chosen  and  a 
holy people. Amen.
