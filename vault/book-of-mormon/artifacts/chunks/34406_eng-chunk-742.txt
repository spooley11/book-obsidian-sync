26 Yea, who shall be consigned to 
a state of endless misery, fulfilling 
the words which say: They that have 
done good shall have  a everlasting 
life; and they that have done evil 
shall have everlasting b damnation. 
And thus it is. Amen.

The  prophecy  of  S amuel,  the  
Lamanite, to the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 13 through 15.

CHAPTER 13

Samuel  the  Lamanite  prophesies  the 
destruction  of  the  Nephites  unless

they  repent—They  and  their  riches 
are cursed—They reject and stone the 
prophets,  are  encircled  about  by  de-
mons, and seek for happiness in doing 
iniquity. About 6 b.c.

And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
eighty and sixth year, the Nephites  
did still remain in wickedness, yea, 
in great wickedness, while the a La-
manites did observe strictly to keep 
the commandments of God, accord-
ing to the law of Moses.

2 And it came to pass that in this  
year there was one a Samuel, a b La-
manite, came into the land of Zara-
hemla, and began to preach unto the  
people. And it came to pass that he 
did preach, many days, repentance 
unto the people, and they did c cast 
him out, and he was about to d return  
to his own land.

3 But behold, the a voice of the Lord 
came unto him, that he should re-
turn again, and prophesy unto the 
people  whatsoever  things  should 
come into his b heart.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
would not suffer that he should en-
ter into the city; therefore he went 
and got upon the a wall thereof, and 
stretched forth his hand and cried 
with a loud voice, and b prophesied 
unto the people whatsoever things 
the Lord put into his heart.

5 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the 
words of the Lord which he doth put  
into my heart; and behold he hath 
put it into my heart to say unto this 
people  that  the  a sword  of  justice 
hangeth over this people; and four 
hundred years pass not away save 
the  sword  of  justice  falleth  upon 
this people.
