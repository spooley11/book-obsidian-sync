28 And it came to pass that in the 
ninety and fourth year they began 
to  increase  in  a  great  degree,  be-
cause there were many dissenters 
of the Nephites who did flee unto 
them,  which  did  cause  much  sor-
row unto those Nephites who did 
remain in the land.

29 And there was also a cause of 
much sorrow among the Lamanites; 
for behold, they had many children 
who did grow up and began to wax 
strong in years, that they became for 
themselves, and were a led away by 
some who were b Zoramites, by their 
lyings and their flattering words, 
to join those Gadianton robbers.

30 And thus were the Lamanites 
afflicted also, and began to decrease 
as to their faith and righteousness, 
because  of  the  wickedness  of  the 
a rising generation.

CHAPTER 2
Wickedness and abominations increase 
among the people—The Nephites and 
Lamanites unite to defend themselves 
against the Gadianton robbers—Con-
verted  Lamanites  become  white  and 
are called Nephites. About a.d. 5–16.
And  it  came  to  pass  that  thus 
passed  away  the  ninety  and  fifth

year also, and the people began to 
forget  those  a signs  and  wonders 
which they had heard, and began 
to be less and less astonished at a 
sign or a wonder from heaven, in-
somuch that they began to be hard 
in their hearts, and blind in their 
minds, and began to disbelieve all 
which they had heard and seen—

2 a Imagining up some vain thing 
in their hearts, that it was wrought 
by  men  and  by  the  power  of  the 
devil,  to  lead  away  and  b deceive  
the hearts of the people; and thus 
did  Satan  get  possession  of  the 
hearts  of  the  people  again,  inso-
much that he did blind their eyes 
and lead them away to believe that 
the doctrine of Christ was a c foolish 
and a vain thing.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the  
people began to wax strong in wick-
edness and abominations; and they 
did not believe that there should be 
any more signs or wonders given; 
and  Satan  did  a go  about,  leading 
away  the  hearts  of  the  people, 
tempting them and causing them 
that they should do great wickedness  
in the land.
