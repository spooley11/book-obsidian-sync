25 But behold, I have been com-
manded that I should turn again and 
prophesy unto this people, yea, and 
to testify against them concerning 
their iniquities.

26 And now, Amulek, because thou 
hast fed me and taken me in, thou 
art blessed; for I was an hungered, 
for I had fasted many days.

27 And Alma a tarried many days 
with  Amulek  before  he  began  to 
preach unto the people.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people did wax more gross in their 
iniquities.

29 And  the  word  came  to  Alma,

saying: Go; and also say unto my ser-
vant  a Amulek, go forth and prophesy 
unto  this  people,  saying—Repent 
ye, for thus saith the Lord, except 
ye repent I will visit this people in 
mine anger; yea, and I will not turn 
my b fierce anger away.

30 And Alma went forth, and also 
Amulek, among the people, to de-
clare the words of God unto them; 
and they were filled with the Holy 
Ghost.

31 And they had a power given unto 
them,  insomuch  that  they  could 
not be confined in dungeons; nei-
ther was it possible that any man 
could slay them; nevertheless they 
did  not  exercise  their  b power  un-
til they were bound in bands and 
cast into prison. Now, this was done 
that the Lord might show forth his 
power in them.

32 And it came to pass that they 
went  forth  and  began  to  preach 
and to prophesy unto the people, 
according to the spirit and power 
which the Lord had given them.

The  words  of  Alma,  and  also  the 
words of Amulek, which were de-
clared  unto  the  people  who  were 
in  the  land  of  Ammonihah.  And 
also they are cast into prison, and 
delivered by the miraculous power 
of God which was in them, accord-
ing to the record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 9 through 14.

CHAPTER 9

Alma  commands  the  people  of  Am-
monihah to repent—The Lord will be 
merciful to the Lamanites in the last 
days—If the Nephites forsake the light, 
they will be destroyed by the Laman-
ites—The Son of God will come soon—
He will redeem those who repent, are 
baptized, and have faith in His name.
