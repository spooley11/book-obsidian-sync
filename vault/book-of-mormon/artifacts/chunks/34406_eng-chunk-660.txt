Helaman  recounts  the  taking  of  An-
tiparah  and  the  surrender  and  later 
the defense of Cumeni—His Ammon-
ite  striplings  fight  valiantly;  all  are 
wounded,  but  none  are  slain—Gid 
reports  the  slaying  and  the  escape  of 
the Lamanite prisoners. About 63 b.c.

And now it came to pass that I re-
ceived an epistle from Ammoron, 
the  king,  stating  that  if  I  would 
deliver  up  those  prisoners  of  war 
whom we had taken that he would 
deliver  up  the  city  of  Antiparah 
unto us.

2 But  I  sent  an  epistle  unto  the 
king, that we were sure our forces 
were sufficient to take the city of

Antiparah by our force; and by de-
livering  up  the  prisoners  for  that 
city  we  should  suppose  ourselves 
unwise, and that we would only de-
liver up our prisoners on exchange.
3 And  Ammoron  refused  mine 
epistle, for he would not exchange 
prisoners;  therefore  we  began  to 
make  preparations  to  go  against 
the city of Antiparah.

4 But the people of Antiparah did 
leave the city, and fled to their other 
cities, which they had possession of, 
to fortify them; and thus the city 
of Antiparah fell into our hands.

5 And  thus  ended  the  twenty 
and  eighth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the judges.

6 And it came to pass that in the 
commencement of the twenty and 
ninth  year,  we  received  a  supply 
of provisions, and also an addition 
to our army, from the land of Zara-
hemla,  and  from  the  land  round 
about, to the number of six thou-
sand men, besides sixty of the a sons 
of the Ammonites who had come to 
join their brethren, my little band 
of two thousand. And now behold, 
we  were  strong,  yea,  and  we  had 
also  plenty  of  provisions  brought  
unto us.

7 And it came to pass that it was 
our desire to wage a battle with the 
army which was placed to protect 
the city a Cumeni.
