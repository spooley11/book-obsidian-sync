14 And  it  came  to  pass  they  did 
drink and were merry, and by and 
by they were all a drunken.

15 And now when Laman and his 
men saw that they were all drunken, 
and were in a a deep sleep, they re-
turned to Moroni and told him all 
the things that had happened.

16 And now this was according to 
the design of Moroni. And Moroni 
had prepared his men with weap-
ons of war; and he went to the city 
Gid, while the Lamanites were in a 
deep sleep and drunken, and cast in 
a weapons of war unto the prisoners, 
insomuch that they were all armed;
17 Yea, even to their women, and 
all those of their children, as many 
as were able to use a weapon of war,

when Moroni had armed all those 
prisoners; and all those things were 
done in a profound silence.

18 But had they awakened the La-
manites, behold they were drunken 
and the Nephites could have slain 
them.

19 But  behold,  this  was  not  the  
desire of Moroni; he did not a delight 
in murder or bloodshed, but he de-
lighted in the saving of his people 
from destruction; and for this cause 
he  might  not  bring  upon  him  in-
justice, he would not fall upon the  
Lamanites and destroy them in their 
drunkenness.

20 But he had obtained his desires; 
for he had armed those prisoners of 
the Nephites who were within the 
wall of the city, and had given them 
power to gain possession of those 
parts which were within the walls.
21 And  then  he  caused  the  men 
who were with him to withdraw a 
pace from them, and surround the 
armies of the Lamanites.

22 Now  behold  this  was  done  in 
the  night-time,  so  that  when  the 
Lamanites  awoke  in  the  morning 
they  beheld  that  they  were  sur-
rounded by the Nephites without, 
and that their prisoners were armed  
within.
