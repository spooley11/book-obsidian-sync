15 For  none  can  have  power  to 
bring it to light save it be given him 
of God; for God wills that it shall 
be done with an a eye single to his 
glory, or the welfare of the ancient 
and long dispersed covenant people 
of the Lord.

16 And blessed be  a he that shall 
bring this thing to light; for it shall 
be  b brought  out  of  darkness  unto 
light, according to the word of God; 
yea, it shall be brought out of the 
earth, and it shall shine forth out of 
darkness, and come unto the knowl-
edge of the people; and it shall be 
done by the power of God.

17 And  if  there  be  a faults  they  
be the faults of a man. But behold, 
we  know  no  fault;  nevertheless 
God knoweth all things; therefore, 
he  that  b condemneth,  let  him  be 
aware lest he shall be in danger of  
hell fire.

18 And he that saith: Show unto 
me, or ye shall be a smitten—let him 
beware  lest  he  commandeth  that 
which is forbidden of the Lord.

19 For behold, the same that a judg-
eth b rashly shall be judged rashly

again;  for  according  to  his  works 
shall  his  wages  be;  therefore,  he 
that smiteth shall be smitten again, 
of the Lord.

20 Behold  what  the  scripture 
says—man shall not a smite, neither 
shall  he  b judge;  for  judgment  is 
mine, saith the Lord, and vengeance 
is mine also, and I will repay.

21 And he that shall breathe out 
a wrath and b strifes against the work 
of the Lord, and against the  c cov-
enant people of the Lord who are 
the house of Israel, and shall say: We 
will destroy the work of the Lord, 
and  the  Lord  will  not  remember 
his covenant which he hath made 
unto the house of Israel—the same 
is in danger to be hewn down and 
cast into the fire;

22 For  the  eternal  a purposes  of 
the Lord shall roll on, until all his 
promises shall be fulfilled.
