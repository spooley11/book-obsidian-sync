2 And it was noised abroad among 
the people immediately, before it 
was yet dark, that the multitude had 
seen Jesus, and that he had minis-
tered unto them, and that he would 
also show himself on the a morrow 
unto the multitude.

3 Yea, and even all the night it was 
noised abroad concerning Jesus; and 
insomuch did they send forth unto 
the people that there were many, 
yea, an exceedingly great number, 
did labor exceedingly all that night, 
that they might be on the morrow in 
the place where Jesus should show  
himself unto the multitude.

3 NEPHI 19  : 4–21

4 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow,  when  the  multitude  was 
gathered  together,  behold,  Nephi 
and his a brother whom he had raised 
from  the  b dead,  whose  name  was 
Timothy,  and  also  his  son,  whose 
name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, 
and Mathonihah, his brother, and 
Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jere-
miah,  and  Shemnon,  and  Jonas, 
and  Zedekiah,  and  Isaiah—now 
these were the c names of the d dis-
ciples  whom  Jesus  had  chosen—
and it came to pass that they went 
forth and stood in the midst of the  
multitude.

5 And behold, the multitude was 
a so great that they did cause that 
they should be separated into twelve 
bodies.

6 And  the  twelve  did  teach  the 
multitude;  and  behold,  they  did 
cause  that  the  multitude  should 
a kneel down upon the face of the 
earth,  and  should  pray  unto  the 
Father in the name of Jesus.

7 And the disciples did pray unto 
the Father also in the name of Jesus. 
And it came to pass that they arose 
and ministered unto the people.
