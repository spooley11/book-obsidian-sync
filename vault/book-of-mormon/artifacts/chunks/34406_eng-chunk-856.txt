18 And this is the word which he 
hath given unto the children of men. 
And for this cause he fulfilleth the 
words which he hath given, and he 
lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.
19 And  a no  unclean  thing  can 
enter into his kingdom; therefore 
nothing entereth into his b rest save 
it be those who have c washed their 
garments in my blood, because of 
their faith, and the repentance of 
all their sins, and their faithfulness 
unto the end.

20 Now this is the commandment: 
a Repent,  all  ye  ends  of  the  earth, 
and come unto me and be b baptized 
in my name, that ye may be c sanc-
tified by the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, that ye may stand d spotless 
before me at the last day.

21 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
this  is  my  a gospel;  and  ye  know 
the things that ye must b do in my 
church;  for  the  works  which  ye 
have seen me do that shall ye also 
do; for that which ye have seen me 
do even that shall ye do;
