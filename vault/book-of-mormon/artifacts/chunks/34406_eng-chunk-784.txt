The chief judge is murdered, the gov-
ernment  is  destroyed,  and  the  people 
divide  into  tribes—Jacob,  an  anti-
Christ, becomes king of a secret com-
bination—Nephi preaches repentance 
and  faith  in  Christ—Angels  minister 
to him daily, and he raises his brother 
from the dead—Many repent and are 
baptized. About a.d. 30–33.
Now behold, I will show unto you 
that they did not establish a king 
over the land; but in this same year, 
yea,  the  thirtieth  year,  they  did 
destroy  upon  the  judgment-seat, 
yea, did murder the chief judge of 
the land.

2 And the people were divided one 
against another; and they did a sepa-
rate one from another into tribes, 
every man according to his family 
and  his  kindred  and  friends;  and 
thus they did destroy the govern-
ment of the land.

3 And  every  tribe  did  appoint  a 
chief  or  a  leader  over  them;  and 
thus they became tribes and lead-
ers of tribes.

4 Now behold, there was no man 
among them save he had much fam-
ily and many kindreds and friends; 
therefore  their  tribes  became  ex-
ceedingly great.

5 Now all this was done, and there 
were no wars as yet among them; 
and all this iniquity had come upon 
the people a because they did b yield 
themselves unto the power of Satan.
6 And the regulations of the gov-
ernment  were  destroyed,  because 
of  the  a secret  combination  of  the 
friends and kindreds of those who 
murdered the prophets.

7 And they did cause a great con-
tention in the land, insomuch that 
the more righteous part of the peo-
ple had nearly all become wicked; 
yea, there were but few righteous 
men among them.

8 And thus six years had not passed 
away  since  the  more  part  of  the 
people had turned from their righ-
teousness, like the dog to his a vomit, 
or  like  the  sow  to  her  wallowing  
in the mire.

9 Now  this  secret  combination, 
which  had  brought  so  great  iniq-
uity  upon  the  people,  did  gather 
themselves together, and did place 
at their head a man whom they did 
call Jacob;

10 And  they  did  call  him  their 
king;  therefore  he  became  a  king 
over this wicked band; and he was 
one of the chiefest who had given 
his voice against the prophets who 
testified of Jesus.
