18 Now Alma did not grant unto 
him the office of being a high priest 
over the church, but he retained the 
office of high priest unto himself; 
but he delivered the judgment-seat 
unto b Nephihah.

19 And this he did that he a himself 
might go forth among his people, 
or among the people of Nephi, that 
he might b preach the c word of God 
unto them, to d stir them up in e re-
membrance of their duty, and that 
he might pull down, by the word 
of God, all the pride and craftiness 
and all the contentions which were 
among  his  people,  seeing  no  way 
that he might reclaim them save it  
were in bearing down in pure f tes-
timony against them.

20 And thus in the commencement 
of the ninth year of the reign of the 
judges  over  the  people  of  Nephi, 
Alma delivered up the judgment-seat  
to a Nephihah, and confined himself

wholly to the  b high priesthood of 
the holy order of God, to the c testi-
mony of the word, according to the 
spirit of revelation and prophecy.

The words which Alma, the High 
Priest according to the holy order 
of God, delivered to the people in 
their cities and villages throughout 
the land.

themselves of pride and envy, and do 
the works of righteousness—The Good 
Shepherd calls His people—Those who 
do evil works are children of the devil—
Alma testifies of the truth of his doctrine 
and  commands  men  to  repent—The 
names of the righteous will be written 
in the book of life. About 83 b.c.
Now it came to pass that Alma be-
gan  to  a deliver  the  word  of  b God 
unto  the  people,  first  in  the  land 
of  Zarahemla,  and  from  thence 
throughout all the land.

2 And these are the words which 
he spake to the people in the church 
which was established in the city 
of Zarahemla, according to his own 
record, saying:
