The Book of MorMon

CHAPTER 1

Ammaron instructs Mormon concerning  
the sacred records—War commences be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites— 
The Three Nephites are taken away—
Wickedness,  unbelief,  sorceries,  and 
witchcraft prevail. About a.d. 321–26.

AND  now  I,  Mormon,  make  a

a record of the things which I  
   have both seen and heard, and

call it the b Book of Mormon.

2 And  about  the  time  that  a Am-
maron hid up the records unto the 
Lord,  he  came  unto  me,  (I  being 
about ten years of age, and I began 
to be b learned somewhat after the 
manner of the learning of my peo-
ple) and Ammaron said unto me: I 
perceive that thou art a c sober child, 
and art quick to observe;

3 Therefore,  when  ye  are  about 
twenty and four years old I would 
that ye should remember the things 
that ye have observed concerning 
this people; and when ye are of that 
age go to the a land Antum, unto a 
hill  which  shall  be  called  b Shim; 
and  there  have  I  deposited  unto 
the Lord all the sacred engravings 
concerning this people.

father into the land southward, even 
to the land of Zarahemla.

7 The whole face of the land had 
become covered with buildings, and 
the people were as numerous almost, 
as it were the sand of the sea.

8 And it came to pass in this year 
there  began  to  be  a  war  between 
the a Nephites, who consisted of the 
Nephites and the Jacobites and the 
Josephites and the Zoramites; and 
this war was between the Nephites, 
and the Lamanites and the Lemuel-
ites and the Ishmaelites.

9 Now  the  a Lamanites  and  the 
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were 
called Lamanites, and the two par-
ties were Nephites and Lamanites.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
war  began  to  be  among  them  in 
the  borders  of  Zarahemla,  by  the 
waters of Sidon.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  had  gathered  together  a 
great number of men, even to ex-
ceed the number of thirty thousand. 
And it came to pass that they did 
have  in  this  same  year  a  number 
of  a battles, in which the Nephites 
did beat the Lamanites and did slay 
many of them.
