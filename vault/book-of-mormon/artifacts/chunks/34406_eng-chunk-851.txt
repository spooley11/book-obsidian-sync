3 NEPHI 26  : 5–16

of their works, whether they be good 
or whether they be evil—

5 If  they  be  good,  to  the  a resur-
rection  of  everlasting  life;  and  if 
they be evil, to the resurrection of 
damnation; being on a parallel, the 
one on the one hand and the other 
on the other hand, according to the 
mercy, and the b justice, and the ho-
liness which is in Christ, who was 
c before the world began.

6 And now there cannot be writ-
ten in this book even a a hundredth 
part of the things which Jesus did 
truly teach unto the people;

7 But behold the a plates of Nephi 
do  contain  the  more  part  of  the 
things which he taught the people.
8 And  these  things  have  I  writ-
ten, which are a a lesser part of the 
things which he taught the people; 
and I have written them to the in-
tent that they may be brought again 
unto this people, b from the Gentiles, 
according to the words which Jesus 
hath spoken.

9 And  when  they  shall  have  re-
ceived this, which is expedient that 
they should have first, to try their 
faith, and if it shall so be that they 
shall believe these things then shall 
the a greater things be made mani-
fest unto them.

10 And if it so be that they will not 
believe these things, then shall the 
a greater things be b withheld from 
them, unto their condemnation.

11 Behold,  I  was  about  to  write 
them,  all  which  were  engraven 
upon the plates of Nephi, but the 
Lord a forbade it, saying: I will b try 
the faith of my people.
