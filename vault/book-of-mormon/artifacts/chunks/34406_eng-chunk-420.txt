who  can  deny  this?  Behold,  I  say 
unto you, whosoever denieth this 
is a c liar and a d child of the devil.
40 For I say unto you that what-
soever is  a good cometh from God, 
and  whatsoever  is  b evil  cometh 
from the devil.

41 Therefore,  if  a  man  bringeth 
forth  a good  works  he  hearkeneth 
unto the voice of the good shepherd, 
and he doth follow him; but who-
soever  bringeth  forth  evil  works, 
the same becometh a b child of the 
devil,  for  he  hearkeneth  unto  his 
voice, and doth follow him.

42 And whosoever doeth this must 
receive  his  a wages  of  him;  there-
fore,  for  his  b wages  he  receiveth 
c death, as to things pertaining unto 
righteousness, being dead unto all 
good works.

43 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should hear me, for I speak 
in the a energy of my soul; for behold,  
I have spoken unto you plainly that 
ye cannot err, or have spoken accord-
ing to the commandments of God.
44 For I am called to speak after 
this manner, according to the a holy 
order  of  God,  which  is  in  Christ 
Jesus;  yea,  I  am  commanded  to 
stand and testify unto this people 
the  things  which  have  been  spo-
ken by our fathers concerning the 
things which are to come.

45 And this is not all. Do ye not 
suppose that I a know of these things 
myself? Behold, I testify unto you 
that  I  do  know  that  these  things 
whereof I have spoken are true. And 
how do ye suppose that I know of 
their surety ?

46 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  they 
are made  a known unto me by the

Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have 
b fasted and prayed many days that 
I might know these things of my-
self. And now I do know of myself 
that they are true; for the Lord God 
hath made them manifest unto me 
by his Holy Spirit; and this is the 
spirit of c revelation which is in me.
47 And moreover, I say unto you 
that it has thus been revealed unto 
me, that the words which have been 
spoken by our fathers are true, even 
so according to the spirit of proph-
ecy which is in me, which is also 
by the manifestation of the Spirit  
of God.
