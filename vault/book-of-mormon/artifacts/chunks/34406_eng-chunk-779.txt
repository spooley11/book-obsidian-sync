21 Surely  he  hath  a blessed  the 
house  of  b Jacob,  and  hath  been 
c merciful unto the seed of Joseph.
22 And a insomuch as the children 
of  Lehi  have  kept  his  command-
ments  he  hath  blessed  them  and 
prospered  them  according  to  his 
word.

23 Yea, and surely shall he again 
bring a a remnant of the seed of Jo-
seph to the b knowledge of the Lord 
their God.

24 And as surely as the Lord liv-
eth, will he a gather in from the four 
quarters of the earth all the rem-
nant of the b seed of Jacob, who are 
scattered abroad upon all the face 
of the earth.

25 And as he hath a covenanted with 
all the house of Jacob, even so shall 
the  covenant  wherewith  he  hath 
covenanted with the house of Jacob 
be  fulfilled  in  his  own  due  time, 
unto  the  b restoring  all  the  house 
of Jacob unto the knowledge of the 
covenant that he hath covenanted  
with them.

26 And then shall they a know their 
Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God; and then shall they be 
gathered in from the four quarters 
of the earth unto their own lands, 
from whence they have been dis-
persed;  yea,  as  the  Lord  liveth  so 
shall it be. Amen.

CHAPTER 6
The Nephites prosper—Pride, wealth, 
and  class  distinctions  arise —The 
Church is rent with dissensions—Sa-
tan leads the people in open rebellion—
Many prophets cry repentance and are 
slain—Their murderers conspire to take 
over the government. About a.d. 26–30.
And now it came to pass that the 
people of the Nephites did all return 
to  their  own  lands  in  the  twenty 
and  sixth  year,  every  man,  with 
his family, his flocks and his herds, 
his  a horses and his cattle, and all
