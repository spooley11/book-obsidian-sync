7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  this 
matter of their contention was set-
tled  by  the  a voice  of  the  people. 
And it came to pass that the voice 
of the people came in favor of the 
freemen,  and  Pahoran  retained 
the  judgment-seat,  which  caused 
much  rejoicing  among  the  breth-
ren  of  Pahoran  and  also  many  of 
the people of liberty, who also put 
the king-men to silence, that they 
durst not oppose but were obliged 
to maintain the cause of freedom.
8 Now  those  who  were  in  favor 
of kings were those of a high birth, 
and they sought to be  b kings; and 
they were supported by those who 
sought  power  and  authority  over 
the people.

ALMA 51  : 9–20

9 But  behold,  this  was  a  critical 
time  for  such  contentions  to  be 
among the people of Nephi; for be-
hold, Amalickiah had again a stirred 
up the hearts of the people of the 
Lamanites  against  the  people  of  
the Nephites, and he was gathering 
together soldiers from all parts of 
his land, and arming them, and pre-
paring for war with all diligence; for 
he had  b sworn to drink the blood 
of Moroni.

10 But  behold,  we  shall  see  that 
his  promise  which  he  made  was 
a rash; nevertheless, he did prepare 
himself and his armies to come to 
battle against the Nephites.

11 Now  his  armies  were  not  so 
great as they had hitherto been, be-
cause of the many thousands who 
had been a slain by the hand of the 
Nephites; but notwithstanding their 
great loss, Amalickiah had gathered 
together a wonderfully great army, 
insomuch that he feared not to come 
down to the land of Zarahemla.
