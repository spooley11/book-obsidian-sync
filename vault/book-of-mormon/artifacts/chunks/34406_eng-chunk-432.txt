10 Nevertheless  Alma  a labored 
much in the spirit, b wrestling with 
God  in  c mighty  prayer,  that  he 
would pour out his Spirit upon the 
people who were in the city; that 
he would also grant that he might 
baptize them unto repentance.

11 Nevertheless,  they  hardened 
their hearts, saying unto him: Behold,  
we know that thou art Alma; and we  
know that thou art high priest over 
the church which thou hast estab-
lished  in  many  parts  of  the  land, 
according to your tradition; and we 
are not of thy church, and we do not 
believe in such foolish traditions.

12 And now we know that because  
we are not of thy church we know 
that thou hast no power over us; and  
thou hast delivered up the judgment- 
seat unto a Nephihah; therefore thou 
art not the chief judge over us.

13 Now when the people had said 
this, and withstood all his words, 
and  a reviled  him,  and  spit  upon 
him, and caused that he should be 
b cast out of their city, he departed 
thence and took his journey towards 
the city which was called Aaron.

14 And it came to pass that while 
he  was  journeying  thither,  being 
weighed down with sorrow, wading 
through much a tribulation and an-
guish of soul, because of the wicked-
ness of the people who were in the 
city of Ammonihah, it came to pass 
while Alma was thus weighed down 
with sorrow, behold an b angel of the 
Lord appeared unto him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma; there-
fore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for  
thou  hast  great  cause  to  rejoice;  
for thou hast been faithful in keep-
ing the commandments of God from 
the time which thou receivedst thy 
first message from him. Behold, I 
am he that a delivered it unto you.
16 And behold, I am sent to a com-
mand thee that thou return to the 
city  of  Ammonihah,  and  preach 
again unto the people of the city; 
yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto 
them, except they repent the Lord 
God will b destroy them.

17 For  behold,  they  do  study  at 
this  time  that  they  may  destroy 
the liberty of thy people, (for thus 
saith the Lord) which is contrary to 
the  a statutes, and judgments, and 
commandments which he has given  
unto his people.
