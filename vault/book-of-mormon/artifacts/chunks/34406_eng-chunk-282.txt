a a holy man, and he did reign over 
his  people  in  righteousness;  and 
there were many holy men in the 
land, and they did speak the word of 
God with b power and with authority; 
and they did use much c sharpness 
because  of  the  stiffneckedness  of 
the people—

18 Wherefore,  with  the  help  of 
these, king a Benjamin, by laboring 
with all the might of his body and 
the b faculty of his whole soul, and 
also  the  prophets,  did  once  more 
establish peace in the land.

The Book of MosiAh

CHAPTER 1

King Benjamin teaches his sons the lan-
guage and prophecies of their fathers—
Their religion and civilization have been 
preserved because of the records kept on 
the various plates—Mosiah is chosen as 
king and is given custody of the records 
and other things. About 130–124 b.c.

AND  now  there  was  no  more

contention in all the a land of  
   Zarahemla,  among  all  the 
people who belonged to king Ben-
jamin, so that king Benjamin had 
continual peace all the remainder of  
his days.

2 And it came to pass that he had 
three  a sons;  and  he  called  their 
names  Mosiah,  and  Helorum,  and 
Helaman. And he caused that they 
should  be  b taught  in  all  the  c lan-
guage  of  his  fathers,  that  thereby 
they might become men of under-
standing; and that they might know 
concerning  the  prophecies  which 
had been spoken by the mouths of 
their fathers, which were delivered 
them by the hand of the Lord.

3 And  he  also  taught  them  con-
cerning  the  records  which  were 
engraven on the a plates of brass, say-
ing: My sons, I would that ye should 
remember that were it not for these 
b plates, which contain these records 
and these commandments, we must 
have suffered in c ignorance, even at 
this present time, not knowing the 
mysteries of God.
