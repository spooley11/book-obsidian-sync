35 And it came to pass that when 
they had all crossed the river Sidon  
that the Lamanites and the Amlicites  
began to flee before them, notwith-
standing  they  were  so  numerous 
that they could not be numbered.
36 And they fled before the Neph-
ites towards the wilderness which 
was west and north, away beyond 
the  borders  of  the  land;  and  the 
Nephites did pursue them with their 
might, and did slay them.

37 Yea,  they  were  met  on  every 
hand, and slain and driven, until 
they were scattered on the west, and 
on the north, until they had reached 
the  wilderness,  which  was  called 
Hermounts; and it was that part of

the wilderness which was infested 
by wild and ravenous beasts.

38 And it came to pass that many 
died  in  the  wilderness  of  their 
wounds, and were devoured by those  
beasts and also the vultures of the air; 
and their bones have been found, and 
have been heaped up on the earth.

CHAPTER 3
The Amlicites had marked themselves 
according to the prophetic word—The 
Lamanites  had  been  cursed  for  their 
rebellion—Men bring their own curses 
upon  themselves—The  Nephites  de-
feat  another  Lamanite  army.  About 
87– 86 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Nephites  
who were not a slain by the weapons  
of  war,  after  having  buried  those 
who had been slain—now the num-
ber of the slain were not numbered, 
because  of  the  greatness  of  their 
number—after  they  had  finished 
burying their dead they all returned 
to their lands, and to their houses, 
and their wives, and their children.
2 Now many women and children 
had been slain with the sword, and 
also many of their flocks and their 
herds; and also many of their fields of 
grain were destroyed, for they were 
trodden down by the hosts of men.
3 And now as many of the Laman-
ites and the Amlicites who had been 
slain upon the bank of the river Si-
don  were  cast  into  the  a waters  of 
Sidon; and behold their bones are 
in the depths of the b sea, and they 
are many.

4 And the a Amlicites were distin-
guished from the Nephites, for they 
had  b marked themselves with red 
in their foreheads after the manner 
of the Lamanites; nevertheless they 
had not shorn their heads like unto 
the Lamanites.
