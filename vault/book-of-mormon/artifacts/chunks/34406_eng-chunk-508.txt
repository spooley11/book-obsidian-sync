17 And it came to pass that they 
called  their  names  a Anti-Nephi-
Lehies;  and  they  were  called  by 
this name and were no more called 
b Lamanites.

18 And  they  began  to  be  a  very 
a industrious people; yea, and they 
were  friendly  with  the  Nephites; 
therefore, they did  b open a corre-
spondence with them, and the c curse 
of God did no more follow them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lamanites come against the people 
of God—The Anti-Nephi-Lehies rejoice 
in Christ and are visited by angels—
They choose to suffer death rather than 
to defend themselves—More Lamanites 
are converted. About 90–77 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Amale-
kites and the Amulonites and the 
Lamanites  who  were  in  the  land  
of a Amulon, and also in the land of 
b Helam, and who were in the land 
of c Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the

land round about, who had not been 
converted and had not taken upon 
them the name of d Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
were stirred up by the Amalekites 
and  by  the  Amulonites  to  anger 
against their brethren.

2 And  their  hatred  became  ex-
ceedingly sore against them, even 
insomuch that they began to rebel 
against their king, insomuch that 
they would not that he should be 
their king; therefore, they took up 
arms  against  the  people  of  Anti-
Nephi-Lehi.

3 Now the king conferred the king-
dom upon his son, and he called his 
name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

4 And the king died in that self-
same year that the Lamanites be-
gan to make preparations for war 
against the people of God.

5 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren and all those who had come up 
with him saw the preparations of 
the Lamanites to destroy their breth-
ren, they came forth to the land of 
Midian, and there Ammon met all 
his brethren; and from thence they 
came  to  the  land  of  Ishmael  that 
they  might  hold  a  a council  with 
Lamoni and also with his brother 
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should 
do to defend themselves against the 
Lamanites.

6 Now  there  was  not  one  soul 
among all the people who had been 
converted unto the Lord that would 
take up arms against their brethren; 
nay, they would not even make any 
preparations for war; yea, and also 
their king commanded them that 
they should not.
