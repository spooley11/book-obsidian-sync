12 And it came to pass that when 
Amalickiah  found  that  he  could 
not get Lehonti to come down off 
from the mount, he went up into 
the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp; 
and he sent again the fourth time 
his message unto Lehonti, desiring 
that he would come down, and that 
he would bring his guards with him.
13 And it came to pass that when 
Lehonti  had  come  down  with  his 
guards to Amalickiah, that Amal-
ickiah desired him to come down 
with his army in the night-time, and  
surround those men in their camps 
over whom the king had given him 
command, and that he would deliver 
them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he 
would  make  him  (Amalickiah)  a 
second a leader over the whole army.
14 And it came to pass that Lehonti 
came down with his men and sur-
rounded the men of Amalickiah, so 
that before they awoke at the dawn 
of day they were surrounded by the 
armies of Lehonti.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they saw that they were surrounded, 
they pled with Amalickiah that he 
would suffer them to fall in with 
their brethren, that they might not 
be destroyed. Now this was the very 
thing which Amalickiah desired.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
delivered  his  men,  a contrary  to 
the  commands  of  the  king.  Now 
this was the thing that Amalickiah

desired, that he might accomplish 
his designs in dethroning the king.
17 Now it was the custom among 
the Lamanites, if their chief leader 
was  killed,  to  appoint  the  second 
leader to be their chief leader.

18 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah caused that one of his ser-
vants should administer a poison by 
degrees to Lehonti, that he died.

19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, 
the Lamanites appointed Amalick-
iah to be their leader and their chief 
commander.

20 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah marched with his armies (for 
he  had  gained  his  desires)  to  the 
a land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, 
which was the chief city.
