me that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, that perhaps I might preserve  
the roots thereof that they perish 
not,  that  I  might  preserve  them 
unto myself, I have done this thing.
12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch 
the tree, and nourish it, according 
to my words.

13 And these will I  a place in the 
nethermost  part  of  my  vineyard, 
whithersoever I will, it mattereth 
not unto thee; and I do it that I may 
preserve  unto  myself  the  natural 
branches of the tree; and also, that I 
may lay up fruit thereof against the 
season, unto myself; for it grieveth 
me that I should lose this tree and 
the fruit thereof.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard went his way, 
and hid the natural a branches of the 
tame olive tree in the nethermost
