22 Therefore  he  caused  that  Te-
ancum  should  take  a  small  num-
ber of men and march down near 
the  seashore;  and  Moroni  and  his 
army,  by  night,  marched  in  the 
wilderness, on the west of the city 
a Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, 
when the guards of the Lamanites 
had discovered Teancum, they ran 
and told it unto Jacob, their leader.
23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Lamanites did march 
forth against Teancum, supposing 
by their numbers to overpower Te-
ancum because of the smallness of 
his numbers. And as Teancum saw 
the armies of the Lamanites coming 
out against him he began to retreat 
down by the seashore, northward.
24 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites saw that he began 
to flee, they took courage and pur-
sued them with vigor. And while 
Teancum  was  thus  leading  away 
the  Lamanites  who  were  pursu-
ing them in vain, behold, Moroni 
commanded that a part of his army 
who were with him should march 
forth into the city, and take pos-
session of it.

25 And  thus  they  did,  and  slew 
all those who had been left to pro-
tect  the  city,  yea,  all  those  who 
would not a yield up their weapons  
of war.

26 And thus Moroni had obtained 
possession of the city Mulek with a 
part of his army, while he marched 
with the remainder to meet the La-
manites when they should return 
from the pursuit of Teancum.

27 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did pursue Teancum until 
they came near the city Bountiful, 
and  then  they  were  met  by  Lehi 
and a small army, which had been 
left to protect the city Bountiful.

28 And  now  behold,  when  the 
chief captains of the Lamanites had  
beheld Lehi with his army coming

against them, they fled in much con-
fusion, lest perhaps they should not 
obtain the city Mulek before Lehi 
should overtake them; for they were 
wearied because of their march, and 
the men of Lehi were fresh.

29 Now  the  Lamanites  did  not 
know that Moroni had been in their 
rear  with  his  army;  and  all  they 
feared was Lehi and his men.

30 Now Lehi was not desirous to 
overtake them till they should meet 
Moroni and his army.
