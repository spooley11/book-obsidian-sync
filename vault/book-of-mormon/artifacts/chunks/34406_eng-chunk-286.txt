18 And now, it came to pass that 
Mosiah went and did as his father 
had  commanded  him,  and  pro-
claimed  unto  all  the  people  who 
were in the land of Zarahemla that 
thereby  they  might  gather  them-
selves  together,  to  go  up  to  the 
a temple  to  hear  the  words  which 
his father should speak unto them.

CHAPTER 2
King Benjamin addresses his people—He  
recounts the equity, fairness, and spiri-
tuality of his reign—He counsels them to 
serve their Heavenly King—Those who 
rebel against God will suffer anguish 
like unquenchable fire. About 124 b.c.
And it came to pass that after Mo-
siah  had  done  as  his  father  had 
commanded  him,  and  had  made 
a proclamation throughout all the 
land,  that  the  people  a gathered 
themselves  together  throughout 
all the land, that they might go up

to the b temple to c hear the d words 
which king Benjamin should speak 
unto them.

2 And there were a great number, 
even  so  many  that  they  did  not 
number them; for they had multi-
plied exceedingly and waxed great 
in the land.

3 And they also took of the a first-
lings of their flocks, that they might 
offer b sacrifice and c burnt d offerings 
e according to the law of Moses;

4 And  also  that  they  might  give 
thanks to the Lord their God, who 
had brought them out of the land 
of Jerusalem, and who had deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their 
enemies, and had  a appointed just 
men to be their b teachers, and also 
a  just  man  to  be  their  king,  who 
had established peace in the c land 
of Zarahemla, and who had taught 
them to d keep the commandments 
of God, that they might rejoice and 
be  filled  with  e love  towards  God 
and all men.

5 And it came to pass that when 
they came up to the temple, they 
pitched  their  tents  round  about,  
every man according to his a fami ly, 
consisting  of  his  wife,  and  his  
sons, and his daughters, and their 
sons,  and  their  daughters,  from 
the  eldest  down  to  the  youngest, 
every  family  being  separate  one 
from another.
