9 And because of the mercies of the 
Father unto the Gentiles, and also 
the judgments of the Father upon 
my people who are of the house of 
Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, 
that after all this, and I have caused 
my people who are of the house of 
Israel to be smitten, and to be af-
flicted, and to be a slain, and to be 
cast out from among them, and to 
become b hated by them, and to be-
come a hiss and a byword among 
them—

10 And  thus  commandeth  the 
Father that I should say unto you: 
At that day when the Gentiles shall 
a sin against my gospel, and shall re-
ject the fulness of my gospel, and 
shall be  b lifted up in the pride of 
their hearts above all nations, and 
above all the people of the whole 
earth, and shall be filled with all 
manner  of  lyings,  and  of  deceits, 
and  of  mischiefs,  and  all  manner

of  hypocrisy,  and  c murders,  and 
d priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and 
of secret abominations; and if they 
shall do all those things, and shall 
e reject  the  fulness  of  my  gospel, 
behold,  saith  the  Father,  I  will 
bring the fulness of my gospel from 
among them.

11 And then will I a remember my 
covenant which I have made unto 
my people, O house of Israel, and 
I will bring my gospel unto them.
12 And I will show unto thee, O 
house  of  Israel,  that  the  Gentiles 
shall not have power over you; but 
I will remember my covenant unto 
you, O house of Israel, and ye shall 
come  unto  the  a knowledge  of  the 
fulness of my gospel.

13 But if the Gentiles will repent 
and  return  unto  me,  saith  the 
Father, behold they shall be a num-
bered among my people, O house  
of Israel.

14 And I will not suffer my people, 
who are of the house of Israel, to 
go through among them, and tread 
them down, saith the Father.
