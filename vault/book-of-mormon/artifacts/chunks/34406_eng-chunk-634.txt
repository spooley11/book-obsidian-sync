12 Yea, even Amalickiah did him-
self come down, at the head of the 
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty 
and fifth year of the reign of the 
judges; and it was at the same time 
that  they  had  begun  to  settle  the 
affairs  of  their  contentions  con-
cerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

13 And it came to pass that when 
the  men  who  were  called  king-
men  had  heard  that  the  Laman-
ites  were  coming  down  to  battle 
against them, they were glad in their 
hearts; and they refused to take up 
arms, for they were so wroth with 
the chief judge, and also with the 
a people of b liberty, that they would 
not  take  up  arms  to  defend  their  
country.

14 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni saw this, and also saw that 
the Lamanites were coming into the 
borders of the land, he was exceed-
ingly wroth because of the  a stub-

bornness of those people whom he 
had labored with so much diligence 
to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly 
wroth; his soul was filled with an-
ger against them.

15 And it came to pass that he sent 
a petition, with the voice of the peo-
ple, unto the governor of the land,  
desiring that he should read it, and 
give him (Moroni) power to compel 
those  dissenters  to  defend  their 
country or to put them to death.

16 For it was his first care to put 
an  end  to  such  contentions  and 
dissensions among the people; for 
behold,  this  had  been  hitherto  a 
cause of all their destruction. And 
it came to pass that it was granted 
according to the voice of the people.
17 And it came to pass that Moroni 
commanded that his army should 
go against those king-men, to pull 
down their pride and their nobil-
ity and level them with the earth, 
or  they  should  take  up  arms  and 
support the cause of liberty.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies  did  march  forth  against 
them; and they did pull down their 
pride and their nobility, insomuch 
that as they did lift their weapons 
of war to fight against the men of 
Moroni they were hewn down and 
leveled to the earth.
