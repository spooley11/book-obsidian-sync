39 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  re-
member  the  awfulness  in  a trans-
gressing against that Holy God, and 
also  the  awfulness  of  yielding  to 
the enticings of that b cunning one. 
Remember, to be c carnally-minded 
is  d death,  and  to  be  e spiritually-
minded is f  life g eternal.

40 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  give  
ear  to  my  words.  Remember  the 
greatness of the Holy One of Israel. 
Do not say that I have spoken hard 
things against you; for if ye do, ye 
will  a revile against the  b truth; for 
I  have  spoken  the  words  of  your 
Maker. I know that the words of truth 
are c hard against all d uncleanness; 
but  the  e righteous  fear  them  not,

for they love the truth and are not 
shaken.

41 O then, my beloved brethren, 
a come unto the Lord, the Holy One. 
Remember that his paths are righ-
teous. Behold, the b way for man is 
c narrow,  but  it  lieth  in  a  straight 
course before him, and the keeper 
of the d gate is the Holy One of Is-
rael; and he employeth no servant 
there; and there is none other way 
save it be by the gate; for he can-
not be deceived, for the Lord God 
is his name.

42 And whoso a knocketh, to him 
will  he  open;  and  the  b wise,  and 
the learned, and they that are rich, 
who are puffed up because of their 
c learning, and their  d wisdom, and 
their  riches—yea,  they  are  they 
whom he despiseth; and save they 
shall  cast  these  things  away,  and 
consider  themselves  e fools  before 
God, and come down in the depths 
of f  humility, he will not open unto 
them.

43 But the things of the wise and 
the  a prudent  shall  be  b hid  from 
them forever—yea, that happiness 
which is prepared for the saints.

44 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  re-
member my words. Behold, I take 
off my garments, and I shake them 
before you; I pray the God of my 
salvation that he view me with his
