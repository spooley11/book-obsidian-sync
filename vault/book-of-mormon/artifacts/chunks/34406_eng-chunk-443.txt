17 Now they knew not that Amu-
lek  could  a know  of  their  designs. 
But it came to pass as they began 
to question him, he b perceived their 
thoughts, and he said unto them: O 
ye wicked and perverse c generation, 
ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye 
are  laying  the  foundations  of  the 
devil; for ye are laying d traps and 
snares to catch the holy ones of God.
18 Ye are laying plans to a pervert 
the  ways  of  the  righteous,  and  to 
bring down the wrath of God upon 
your  heads,  even  to  the  utter  de-
struction of this people.

19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who 
was our last king, when he was about 
to deliver up the kingdom, having 
no one to confer it upon, causing 
that this people should be governed

by their own voices—yea, well did 
he say that if the time should come 
that the voice of this people should 
a choose iniquity, that is, if the time 
should come that this people should 
fall into transgression, they would 
be ripe for destruction.

20 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
well doth the Lord a judge of your 
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this 
people, by the voice of his b angels: 
Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom 
of heaven is at hand.

21 Yea,  well  doth  he  cry,  by  the 
voice of his angels that: a I will come 
down among my people, with equity 
and justice in my hands.

22 Yea, and I say unto you that if 
it were not for the a prayers of the 
righteous, who are now in the land, 
that ye would even now be visited 
with utter destruction; yet it would 
not be by b flood, as were the people 
in the days of c Noah, but it would 
be  by  famine,  and  by  pestilence, 
and the d sword.

23 But it is by the a prayers of the 
righteous that ye are spared; now 
therefore,  if  ye  will  b cast  out  the 
righteous from among you then will 
not the Lord stay his hand; but in 
his fierce anger he will come out 
against you; then ye shall be smit-
ten by famine, and by pestilence, 
and by the sword; and the c time is 
soon at hand except ye repent.
