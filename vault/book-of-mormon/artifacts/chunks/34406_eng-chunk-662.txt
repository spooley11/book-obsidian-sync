16 And now, in those critical cir-
cumstances, it became a very seri-
ous matter to determine concerning 
these prisoners of war; nevertheless, 
we did resolve to send them down 
to  the  land  of  Zarahemla;  there-
fore we selected a part of our men,  
and  gave  them  charge  over  our 
prisoners to go down to the land of  
Zarahemla.

17 But it came to pass that on the 
morrow they did return. And now 
behold, we did not a inquire of them 
concerning  the  prisoners;  for  be-
hold, the Lamanites were upon us, 
and they returned in season to save 
us  from  falling  into  their  hands. 
For behold, Ammoron had sent to 
their support a new supply of pro-
visions and also a numerous army  
of men.

18 And it came to pass that those 
men whom we sent with the pris-
oners did arrive in season to check 
them, as they were about to over-
power us.

19 But behold, my little band of 
two thousand and sixty fought most 
desperately;  yea,  they  were  firm 
before the Lamanites, and did a ad-
minister death unto all those who 
opposed them.

20 And  as  the  remainder  of  our 
army  were  about  to  give  way  be-
fore the Lamanites, behold, those 
two thousand and sixty were firm 
and undaunted.

21 Yea,  and  they  did  a obey  and 
observe  to  perform  every  word 
of  command  with  exactness;  yea, 
and even according to their faith it 
was done unto them; and I did re-
member the words which they said 
unto  me  that  their  b mothers  had  
taught them.

22 And now behold, it was these 
my sons, and those men who had 
been selected to convey the prison-
ers, to whom we owe this great vic-
tory; for it was they who did beat 
the Lamanites; therefore they were 
driven back to the city of Manti.

23 And we retained our city Cu-
meni,  and  were  not  all  destroyed 
by the sword; nevertheless, we had 
suffered great loss.

24 And it came to pass that after 
the  Lamanites  had  fled,  I  imme-
diately  gave  orders  that  my  men 
who had been wounded should be

taken  from  among  the  dead,  and 
caused  that  their  wounds  should  
be dressed.
