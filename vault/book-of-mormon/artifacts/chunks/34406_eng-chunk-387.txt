that they might, with these whom 
they had b selected, go up to the land 
of  c Nephi  that  they  might  preach 
the things which they had heard, 
and  that  they  might  impart  the 
word of God to their brethren, the  
Lamanites—

2 a That perhaps they might bring 
them to the knowledge of the Lord 
their God, and convince them of the 
iniquity of their fathers; and that 
perhaps  they  might  cure  them  of 
their b hatred towards the Nephites, 
that they might also be brought to 
rejoice in the Lord their God, that 
they  might  become  friendly  to 
one another, and that there should 
be no more contentions in all the 
land which the Lord their God had 
given them.

3 Now they were desirous that sal-
vation should be declared to every 
creature, for they could not  a bear 
that any human b soul should c per-
ish; yea, even the very thoughts that 
any  soul  should  endure  d endless 
torment did cause them to quake 
and e tremble.

4 And  thus  did  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord work upon them, for they were 
the very a vilest of sinners. And the 
Lord saw fit in his infinite b mercy 
to  spare  them;  nevertheless  they 
suffered much anguish of soul be-
cause of their iniquities, suffering 
much and fearing that they should 
be cast off forever.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did plead with their father many 
days that they might go up to the 
land of Nephi.

6 And king Mosiah went and a in-
quired of the Lord if he should let 
his sons go up among the Laman-
ites to preach the word.
