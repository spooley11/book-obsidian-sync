darkness and secret combinations, 
even unto destruction, except they 
repent before they are fully b ripe.
32 And  now,  my  son,  remember 
the words which I have spoken unto 
you;  trust  not  those  secret  plans 
unto  this  people,  but  teach  them 
an everlasting  a hatred against sin 
and iniquity.

33 a Preach unto them repentance, 
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; 
teach them to humble themselves 
and to be b meek and lowly in heart; 
teach  them  to  c withstand  every 
d temptation of the devil, with their 
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

34 Teach them to never be weary 
of good works, but to be meek and 
lowly in heart; for such shall find 
a rest to their souls.

35 O, remember, my son, and a learn 
b wisdom in thy  c youth; yea, learn 
in thy youth to keep the command-
ments of God.

36 Yea, and a cry unto God for all 
thy  support;  yea,  let  all  thy  b do-
ings be unto the Lord, and whith-
ersoever thou goest let it be in the 
Lord; yea, let all thy  c thoughts be 
directed unto the Lord; yea, let the 
affections  of  thy  heart  be  placed 
upon the Lord forever.

37 a Counsel  with  the  Lord  in  all 
thy doings, and he will direct thee 
for b good; yea, when thou liest down 
at  night  lie  down  unto  the  Lord, 
that he may watch over you in your 
sleep; and when thou risest in the 
c morning  let  thy  heart  be  full  of 
thanks unto God; and if ye do these 
things, ye shall be lifted up at the  
last day.

38 And  now,  my  son,  I  have  
somewhat  to  say  concerning  the 
thing which our fathers call a ball, 
or  director—or  our  fathers  called 
it a Liahona, which is, being inter-
preted,  a  compass;  and  the  Lord 
prepared it.

39 And behold, there cannot any 
man work after the manner of so 
curious  a  workmanship.  And  be-
hold, it was prepared to show unto 
our fathers the course which they 
should travel in the wilderness.
