baptize  in  a Bethabara,  beyond  
Jordan; and he also said he should 
b baptize with water; even that he 
should  baptize  the  Messiah  with 
water.

10 And after he had baptized the 
Messiah with water, he should be-
hold and bear record that he had 
baptized  the  a Lamb  of  God,  who 
should  take  away  the  sins  of  the 
world.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father had spoken these words he 
spake unto my brethren concern-
ing  the  gospel  which  should  be 
preached among the Jews, and also 
concerning the  a dwindling of the 
Jews  in  b unbelief.  And  after  they 
had c slain the Messiah, who should 
come, and after he had been slain 
he should d rise from the dead, and 
should make himself e manifest, by 
the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.
12 Yea, even my father spake much 
concerning the Gentiles, and also 
concerning the house of Israel, that 
they should be compared like unto 
an  a olive  tree,  whose  b branches 
should  be  broken  off  and  should 
be  c scattered upon all the face of 
the earth.

13 Wherefore, he said it must needs 
be that we should be led with one 
accord  into  the  a land  of  promise, 
unto the fulfilling of the word of 
the  Lord,  that  we  should  be  scat-
tered upon all the face of the earth.

14 And after the house of a Israel 
should be scattered they should be 
b gathered together again; or, in fine, 
after the c Gentiles had received the 
fulness of the d Gospel, the natural 
branches of the  e olive tree, or the 
f remnants  of  the  house  of  g Israel, 
should be grafted in, or h come to the  
knowledge of the true Messiah, their 
Lord and their Redeemer.

15 And after this manner of lan-
guage  did  my  father  prophesy 
and speak unto my brethren, and 
also many more things which I do 
not  write  in  this  book;  for  I  have  
written  as  many  of  them  as  were 
expedient  for  me  in  mine  a other  
book.
