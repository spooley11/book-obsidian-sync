33 And it came to pass that Anti-
pus did march forth with a part of 
his army, leaving the remainder to 
maintain the city. But he did not 
march forth until I had gone forth 
with my little army, and came near 
the city Antiparah.

34 And now, in the city Antiparah 
were stationed the strongest army 
of  the  Lamanites;  yea,  the  most 
numerous.

35 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  been  informed  by  their 
spies,  they  came  forth  with  their 
army and marched against us.

36 And it came to pass that we did 
flee before them, northward. And 
thus  we  did  lead  away  the  most 
powerful army of the Lamanites;

37 Yea, even to a considerable dis-
tance,  insomuch  that  when  they 
saw the army of Antipus pursuing 
them,  with  their  might,  they  did 
not  turn  to  the  right  nor  to  the 
left, but pursued their march in a 
straight course after us; and, as we 
suppose, it was their intent to slay 
us before Antipus should overtake 
them, and this that they might not 
be surrounded by our people.

38 And  now  Antipus,  beholding 
our danger, did speed the march of 
his army. But behold, it was night; 
therefore  they  did  not  overtake 
us,  neither  did  Antipus  overtake 
them;  therefore  we  did  camp  for  
the night.

39 And it came to pass that before 
the dawn of the morning, behold, 
the  Lamanites  were  pursuing  us. 
Now we were not sufficiently strong

to contend with them; yea, I would 
not suffer that my little sons should 
fall into their hands; therefore we 
did  continue  our  march,  and  we 
took our march into the wilderness.
40 Now they durst not turn to the 
right nor to the left lest they should 
be surrounded; neither would I turn 
to the right nor to the left lest they 
should overtake me, and we could 
not stand against them, but be slain, 
and they would make their escape; 
and  thus  we  did  flee  all  that  day 
into  the  wilderness,  even  until  it 
was dark.

41 And it came to pass that again, 
when the light of the morning came 
we saw the Lamanites upon us, and 
we did flee before them.
