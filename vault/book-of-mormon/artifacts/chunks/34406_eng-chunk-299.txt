24 And thus saith the Lord: They 
shall  stand  as  a  bright  testimony 
against this people, at the judgment 
day; whereof they shall be judged, 
every man according to his a works, 
whether they be good, or whether 
they be evil.

25 And  if  they  be  evil  they  are 
consigned to an awful a view of their 
own guilt and abominations, which 
doth cause them to shrink from the 
presence of the Lord into a state of 
b misery and c endless torment, from 
whence they can no more return; 
therefore they have drunk damna-
tion to their own souls.

26 Therefore, they have drunk out 
of  the  a cup  of  the  wrath  of  God, 
which justice could no more deny 
unto them than it could deny that 
b Adam  should  fall  because  of  his 
partaking  of  the  forbidden  c fruit; 
therefore, d mercy could have claim 
on them no more forever.

27 And their a torment is as a b lake 
of fire and brimstone, whose flames 
are unquenchable, and whose smoke 
ascendeth  up  c forever  and  ever. 
Thus  hath  the  Lord  commanded 
me. Amen.

CHAPTER 4
King Benjamin continues his address—
Salvation comes because of the Atonement 
—Believe in God to be saved—Retain

a remission of your sins through faith-
fulness—Impart  of  your  substance  to 
the poor—Do all things in wisdom and 
order. About 124 b.c.

And now, it came to pass that when 
king  Benjamin  had  made  an  end 
of speaking the words which had 
been  delivered  unto  him  by  the 
a angel of the Lord, that he cast his 
eyes round about on the multitude, 
and behold they had b fallen to the 
earth, for the c fear of the Lord had 
come upon them.

2 And they had a viewed themselves  
in their own b carnal state, even c less  
than the dust of the earth. And they 
all cried aloud with one voice, say-
ing: O have mercy, and apply the 
d atoning blood of Christ that we may  
receive forgiveness of our sins, and 
our hearts may be e purified; for we 
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, who f created heaven and earth, 
and all things; who shall come down 
among the children of men.
