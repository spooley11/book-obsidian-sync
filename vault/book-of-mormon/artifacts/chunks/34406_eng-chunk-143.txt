3 For the Lord shall a comfort b Zion, 
he will comfort all her waste places; 
and he will make her  c wilderness 
like d Eden, and her desert like the 
garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness 
shall be found therein, thanksgiv-
ing and the voice of melody.

4 Hearken unto me, my people; and 
give ear unto me, O my nation; for 
a a law shall proceed from me, and 
I  will  make  my  judgment  to  rest 
for a b light for the people.

5 My  righteousness  is  near;  my 
a salvation is gone forth, and mine 
arm  shall  b judge  the  people.  The 
c isles  shall  wait  upon  me,  and  on 
mine arm shall they trust.

6 Lift up your eyes to the a heavens, 
and look upon the earth beneath; 
for the heavens shall b vanish away 
like  smoke,  and  the  earth  shall 
c wax old like a garment; and they 
that dwell therein shall die in like 
manner. But my salvation shall be 
forever, and my righteousness shall 
not be abolished.

7 Hearken unto me, ye that know 
righteousness, the people in whose 
heart I have written my law, a fear
