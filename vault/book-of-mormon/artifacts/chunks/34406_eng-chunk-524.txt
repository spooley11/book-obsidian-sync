16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  as 
Ammon  was  going  forth  into  the 
land, that he and his brethren met 
Alma, over in the a place of which 
has been spoken; and behold, this 
was a joyful meeting.

17 Now  the  a joy  of  Ammon  was 
so great even that he was full; yea, 
he was swallowed up in the joy of 
his  God,  even  to  the  b exhausting 
of his strength; and he fell  c again 
to the earth.

ALMA 27  : 18–29

18 Now  was  not  this  a exceed-
ing joy ? Behold, this is joy which 
none receiveth save it be the truly 
penitent  and  humble  seeker  of  
b happiness.

19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting 
his a brethren was truly great, and 
also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and 
Himni; but behold their joy was not 
that to exceed their strength.

20 And now it came to pass that 
Alma conducted his brethren back 
to the land of Zarahemla; even to 
his a own house. And they went and 
told the b chief judge all the things 
that  had  happened  unto  them  in 
the  land  of  Nephi,  among  their 
brethren, the Lamanites.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
chief  judge  sent  a  proclamation 
throughout  all  the  land,  desiring 
the  voice  of  the  people  concern-
ing  the  admitting  their  brethren, 
who  were  the  people  of  a Anti- 
Nephi-Lehi.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  people  came,  saying: 
Behold, we will give up the a land of 
b Jershon, which is on the east by the 
sea, which joins the land Bountiful, 
which is on the south of the land 
Bountiful; and this land Jershon is 
the land which we will give unto 
our brethren for an inheritance.
