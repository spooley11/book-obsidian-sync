26 And it came to pass that they 
ate  and  slept,  and  prepared  for 
death  on  the  morrow.  And  they 
were  large  and  mighty  men  as  to 
the strength of men.

27 And it came to pass that they 
fought for the space of three hours, 
and  they  fainted  with  the  loss  of 
blood.

the men of Coriantumr had received 
sufficient strength that they could 
walk,  they  were  about  to  flee  for 
their lives; but behold, Shiz arose, 
and also his men, and he swore in 
his wrath that he would slay Cori-
antumr or he would perish by the 
sword.

29 Wherefore, he did pursue them, 
and on the morrow he did overtake 
them; and they fought again with 
the sword. And it came to pass that 
when  they  had  a all  fallen  by  the 
sword, save it were Coriantumr and 
Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with 
the loss of blood.

30 And it came to pass that when 
Coriantumr  had  leaned  upon  his 
sword,  that  he  rested  a  little,  he 
smote off the head of Shiz.

31 And it came to pass that after 
he had smitten off the head of Shiz,

that Shiz raised up on his hands and 
a fell; and after that he had strug-
gled for breath, he died.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  
a Coriantumr fell to the earth, and 
became as if he had no life.

33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, 
and said unto him: Go forth. And 
he went forth, and beheld that the 
words of the Lord had all been ful-
filled; and he a finished his b record; 
(and  the  c hundredth  part  I  have 
not written) and he hid them in a 
manner  that  the  people  of  Limhi 
did find them.

34 Now the last words which are 
written by a Ether are these: Whether 
the Lord will that I be translated, 
or that I suffer the will of the Lord 
in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it 
so be that I am b saved in the king-
dom of God. Amen.
