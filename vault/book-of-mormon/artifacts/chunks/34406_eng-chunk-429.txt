18 For as I said unto you from the 
beginning, that I had much desire 
that ye were not in the state of a di-
lemma like your brethren, even so 
I have found that my desires have 
been gratified.

19 For  I  perceive  that  ye  are  in 
the  paths  of  righteousness;  I  per-
ceive that ye are in the path which 
leads to the kingdom of God; yea, 
I perceive that ye are making his 
a paths straight.

20 I perceive that it has been made 
known unto you, by the testimony 
of his word, that he cannot  a walk 
in crooked paths; neither doth he 
vary from that which he hath said; 
neither hath he a shadow of turning 
from the right to the left, or from 
that which is right to that which is 
wrong; therefore, his course is one 
eternal round.

21 And he doth not dwell in a un-
holy temples; neither can filthiness 
or  anything  which  is  unclean  be 
received into the kingdom of God; 
therefore I say unto you the time 
shall come, yea, and it shall be at 
the last day, that he who is b filthy 
shall remain in his filthiness.
