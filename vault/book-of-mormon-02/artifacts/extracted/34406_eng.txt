Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and  
also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the  
house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of command-
ment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and 
sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To 
come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—
Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in  
due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift 
of God.
 An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of 
the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded 
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to 
heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what 
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know  
the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to  
the  convincing  of  the  Jew  and  Gentile  that Jesus  is  the Christ,  the  
Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there  
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things 
of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

inTrOdUCTiOn

The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the 

Bible. It is a record of God’s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the 

Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.

The  book  was  written  by  many  ancient  prophets  by  the  spirit  of 
prophecy  and  revelation.  Their  words,  written  on  gold  plates,  were 
quoted  and  abridged  by  a  prophet-historian  named  Mormon.  The 
record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Je-
rusalem  in  600 b.c.  and  afterward  separated  into  two  nations,  known 
as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when 
the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is 
known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed ex-
cept the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American 
Indians.

The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal 
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His res-
urrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of 
salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and 
eternal salvation in the life to come.

After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his 
son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in 
the Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glo-
rified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and in-
structed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation 
into the English language.

In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated 
them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many 
languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of 
the living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws 
and ordinances of His gospel may be saved.

Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I told the breth-
ren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, 
and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by 
abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”

In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see 
the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and 
divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included 
herewith as “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” and “The Testimony of 
Eight Witnesses.”

We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder 
in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal 
Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this 
course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by 
the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3–5.)

Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come 
to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, 
that Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days, and that 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom 
once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming 
of the Messiah.

The TeSTimOny Of Three WiTneSSeS

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom  

   this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, 
and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record,  
which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their 
brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of 
which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been trans-
lated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; 
wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify 
that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they 
have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we 
declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from 
heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and 
saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the  
grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and 
bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. 
Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear 
record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, 
we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in  
Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found 
spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him 
eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.

The TeSTimOny Of The  
PrOPheT JOSePh SmiTh

The Prophet Joseph Smith’s own words about the coming forth of the 

Book of Mormon are:

“On the evening of the . . . twenty-first of September [1823] . . . I betook 

myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God. . . .

“While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light 
appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was 
lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my 
bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.

“He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness 
beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly 
thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His 
hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were 
his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and 
neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but 
this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.

“Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was 
glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. 
The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately 
around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the 
fear soon left me.

“He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent 
from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God 
had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and 
evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both 
good and evil spoken of among all people.

“He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an 
account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from 
whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel 
was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;
“Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fas-
tened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thum-
mim—deposited  with  the  plates;  and  the  possession  and  use  of  these 
stones were what constituted ‘seers’ in ancient or former times; and that 
God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book. . . .

“Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spo-
ken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I 
should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the 
Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to 
show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with 
me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see 
the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and dis-
tinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.

“After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather 
immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and 
it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around  
him;  when,  instantly  I  saw,  as  it  were,  a  conduit  open  right  up  into 
heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was 
left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.

“I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at 
what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the 

TesTiMony of The ProPheT JosePh sMiTh

x

midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again 
beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly 
messenger was again by my bedside.

“He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had 
done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, 
he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, 
with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence; and that these 
grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. Having 
related these things, he again ascended as he had done before.

“By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that 
sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at 
what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again 
I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or 
repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution 
to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence of 
the indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for 
the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have 
no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must 
not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom; 
otherwise I could not get them.

“After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and 
I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experi-
enced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had as-
cended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day 
was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole 
of that night.

“I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary 
labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found 
my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who 
was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, 
and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; 
but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my 
strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a 
time was quite unconscious of anything.

“The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, call-
ing me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing 
over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto 
me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me 
to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which 
I had received.

“I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole 
matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and 
do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place 
where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing 
to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew 
the place the instant that I arrived there.

“Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, 
stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the 
neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under 
a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This 
stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thin-
ner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the 
ground, but the edge all around was covered with earth.

“Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under 
the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, 
and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and 

xi

TesTiMony of The ProPheT JosePh sMiTh

the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay 
was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bot-
tom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on these 
stones lay the plates and the other things with them.

“I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messen-
ger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had 
not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he 
told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that 
time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue 
to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.

“Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, 
and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruc-
tion and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what 
the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was 
to be conducted in the last days. . . .

“At  length  the  time  arrived  for  obtaining  the  plates,  the  Urim  and 
Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of Septem-
ber, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual 
at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the 
same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: that 
I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, 
or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would 
use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should 
call for them, they should be protected.

“I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to 
keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I 
had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no 
sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions 
were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented 
was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter 
and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to 
get them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remained 
safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required 
at my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for 
them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until 
this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and 
thirty-eight.”

For a more complete account, see Joseph Smith—History in the Pearl 

of Great Price.

The ancient record thus brought forth from the earth as the voice of a 
people speaking from the dust, and translated into modern speech by the 
gift and power of God as attested by Divine affirmation, was first pub-
lished to the world in the year 1830 as The Book of Mormon.

A brief exPLAnATiOn AbOUT  
The bOOk Of mOrmOn

The Book of Mormon is a sacred record of peoples in ancient America and 

was engraved upon metal plates. Sources from which this record was 

compiled include the following:
  1.  The Plates of Nephi, which were of two kinds: the small plates and the 
large plates. The former were more particularly devoted to spiritual 
matters and the ministry and teachings of the prophets, while the lat-
ter were occupied mostly by a secular history of the peoples concerned 
(1 Nephi 9:2–4). From the time of Mosiah, however, the large plates also 
included items of major spiritual importance.

  2.  The Plates of Mormon, which consist of an abridgment by Mormon from 
the large plates of Nephi, with many commentaries. These plates also 
contained a continuation of the history by Mormon and additions by his 
son Moroni.

  3.  The Plates of Ether, which present a history of the Jaredites. This record 
was abridged by Moroni, who inserted comments of his own and incorpo-
rated the record with the general history under the title “Book of Ether.”
  4.  The  Plates  of  Brass  brought by the people of Lehi from Jerusalem in  
600 b.c. These contained “the five books of Moses, . . . and also a record of  
the Jews from the beginning, . . . down to the commencement of the reign  
of Zedekiah, king of Judah; and also the prophecies of the holy prophets” 
(1 Nephi 5:11–13). Many quotations from these plates, citing Isaiah and 
other biblical and nonbiblical prophets, appear in the Book of Mormon.
The Book of Mormon comprises fifteen main parts or divisions, known, 
with one exception, as books, usually designated by the name of their princi-
pal author. The first portion (the first six books, ending with Omni) is a trans-
lation from the small plates of Nephi. Between the books of Omni and Mosiah 
is an insert called the Words of Mormon. This insert connects the record 
engraved on the small plates with Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates.
The longest portion, from Mosiah through Mormon chapter 7, is a trans-
lation of Mormon’s abridgment of the large plates of Nephi. The concluding 
portion, from Mormon chapter 8 to the end of the volume, was engraved 
by Mormon’s son Moroni, who, after finishing the record of his father’s life, 
made an abridgment of the Jaredite record (as the book of Ether) and later 
added the parts known as the book of Moroni.

In  or  about  the  year a.d. 421,  Moroni,  the  last  of  the  Nephite  prophet- 
historians, sealed the sacred record and hid it up unto the Lord, to be brought 
forth in the latter days, as predicted by the voice of God through His ancient 
prophets. In a.d. 1823, this same Moroni, then a resurrected personage, visited 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and subsequently delivered the engraved plates  
to him.

About this edition: The original title page, immediately preceding the contents  
page, is taken from the plates and is part of the sacred text. Introductions in 
a non-italic typeface, such as in 1 Nephi and immediately preceding Mosiah 
chapter 9, are also part of the sacred text. Introductions in italics, such as in 
chapter headings, are not original to the text but are study helps included for 
convenience in reading.

Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of 
the Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate  
to bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and 
early editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith.

The firsT Book of nePhi

hiS reign And miniSTry

An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being called, (be-
ginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi 
to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people 
concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days’ 
journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and 
returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of 
their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their 
families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the 
wilderness. The course of their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s 
brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They 
call the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the 
promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in 
other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

CHAPTER 1

Nephi begins the record of his people—
Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire and 
reads  from  a  book  of  prophecy—He 
praises God, foretells the coming of the 
Messiah, and prophesies the destruction 
of Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the 
Jews. About 600 b.c.

I,  NEPHI,  having  been  a born  

of  b goodly  c parents, therefore I  
was d taught somewhat in all the 
learning of my father; and having 
seen many e afflictions in the course 
of  my  days,  nevertheless,  having 
been highly favored of the Lord in all  
my  days;  yea,  having  had  a  great 
knowledge  of  the  goodness  and 
the  mysteries  of  God,  therefore  I 
make a f record of my proceedings 
in my days.

2 Yea, I make a record in the a lan-
guage of my father, which consists 
of the learning of the Jews and the 
language of the Egyptians.

3 And I know that the record which 
I make is a true; and I make it with 
mine own hand; and I make it ac-
cording to my knowledge.

4 For it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the a first year of the 
reign of  b Zedekiah, king of Judah, 
(my  father,  Lehi,  having  dwelt  at 
c Jerusalem in all his days); and in 
that  same  year  there  came  many 
d prophets,  prophesying  unto  the 
people  that  they  must  e repent,  or 
the  great  city  f Jerusalem  must  be  
destroyed.

5 Wherefore it came to pass that 
my  father,  Lehi,  as  he  went  forth 
prayed  unto  the  Lord,  yea,  even

with all his a heart, in behalf of his  
people.

6 And it came to pass as he prayed 
unto the Lord, there came a a pillar 
of fire and dwelt upon a rock before 
him; and he saw and heard much; 
and because of the things which he 
saw and heard he did b quake and 
tremble exceedingly.

7 And it came to pass that he re-
turned  to  his  own  house  at  Jeru-
salem;  and  he  cast  himself  upon 
his bed, being a overcome with the 
Spirit and the things which he had  
seen.

8 And being thus overcome with 
the  Spirit,  he  was  carried  away 
in a  a vision, even that he saw the 
b heavens open, and he thought he 
c saw God sitting upon his throne, 
surrounded with numberless con-
courses  of  angels  in  the  attitude 
of singing and praising their God.
9 And it came to pass that he saw 
One  descending  out  of  the  midst 
of heaven, and he beheld that his 
a luster  was  above  that  of  the  sun 
at noon-day.

10 And he also saw a twelve others 
following him, and their brightness 
did exceed that of the stars in the 
firmament.

11 And they came down and went 
forth upon the face of the earth; and 
the first came and a stood before my 
father, and gave unto him a b book, 
and bade him that he should read.
12 And it came to pass that as he 

read, he was filled with the a Spirit 
of the Lord.

13 And  he  read,  saying:  Wo,  wo, 
unto  Jerusalem,  for  I  have  seen 
thine a abominations! Yea, and many 
things did my father read concern-
ing  b Jerusalem—that  it  should  be 
destroyed,  and  the  inhabitants 
thereof; many should perish by the 
sword, and many should be c carried 
away captive into Babylon.

14 And it came to pass that when 
my father had read and seen many 
great and marvelous things, he did 
exclaim many things unto the Lord; 
such  as:  Great  and  marvelous  are 
thy works, O Lord God Almighty! 
Thy throne is high in the heavens, 
and thy a power, and goodness, and 
mercy are over all the inhabitants 
of the earth; and, because thou art 
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those 
who b come unto thee that they shall 
perish!

15 And  after  this  manner  was 
the  language  of  my  father  in  the 
praising of his God; for his soul did 
rejoice,  and  his  whole  heart  was 
filled, because of the things which 
he  had  seen,  yea,  which  the  Lord 
had shown unto him.

16 And now I, Nephi, do not make 
a full account of the things which 
my father hath written, for he hath 
written many things which he saw 
in  a visions  and  in  b dreams;  and 
he also hath written many things  
which  he  c prophesied  and  spake

unto his children, of which I shall 
not make a full account.

17 But I shall make an account of 
my proceedings in my days. Behold, 
I make an a abridgment of the record 
of my b father, upon c plates which I 
have made with mine own hands; 
wherefore,  after  I  have  abridged 
the record of my d father then will I 
make an account of mine own life.
18 Therefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should know, that after the Lord had 
shown  so  many  marvelous  things 
unto my father, Lehi, yea, concern-
ing the a destruction of Jerusalem, 
behold  he  went  forth  among  the 
people,  and  began  to  b prophesy 
and to declare unto them concern-
ing the things which he had both 
seen and heard.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a Jews did b mock him because of the 
things which he testified of them; 
for he truly testified of their c wick-
edness and their abominations; and 
he testified that the things which he 
saw and heard, and also the things 
which he read in the book, mani-
fested  plainly  of  the  coming  of  a 
d Messiah, and also the redemption 
of the world.

20 And when the Jews heard these 
things they were angry with him; 
yea, even as with the prophets of 
old, whom they had a cast out, and 
stoned,  and  slain;  and  they  also 
b sought  his  life,  that  they  might 
take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, 
will show unto you that the tender 
c mercies  of  the  Lord  are  over  all  

those  whom  he  hath  chosen,  be-
cause of their faith, to make them 
mighty  even  unto  the  power  of  
d deliverance.

CHAPTER 2
Lehi takes his family into the wilder-
ness by the Red Sea—They leave their 
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the 
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the 
commandments—Laman and Lemuel 
murmur against their father—Nephi is 
obedient and prays in faith; the Lord 
speaks to him, and he is chosen to rule 
over his brethren. About 600 b.c.
For  behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
the Lord spake unto my father, yea, 
even in a dream, and said unto him: 
Blessed  art  thou  Lehi,  because  of 
the  things  which  thou  hast  done; 
and because thou hast been faithful 
and declared unto this people the 
things  which  I  commanded  thee, 
behold,  they  seek  to  a take  away  
thy b life.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord 
a commanded my father, even in a 
b dream, that he should c take his fam-
ily and depart into the wilderness.
3 And it came to pass that he was 
a obedient unto the word of the Lord, 
wherefore he did as the Lord com-
manded him.

4 And it came to pass that he de-
parted  into  the  wilderness.  And 
he left his house, and the land of 
his inheritance, and his gold, and 
his silver, and his precious things, 
and took nothing with him, save it

were  his  family,  and  provisions, 
and  tents,  and  a departed  into  the 
wilderness.

5 And he came down by the bor-
ders near the shore of the a Red Sea; 
and he traveled in the wilderness 
in the borders which are nearer the 
Red Sea; and he did travel in the 
wilderness with his family, which 
consisted  of  my  mother,  Sariah, 
and my elder brothers, who were 
Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

6 And it came to pass that when he 
had traveled three days in the wilder-
ness, he pitched his tent in a a valley 
by the side of a b river of water.

7 And it came to pass that he built 
an  a altar  of  b stones,  and  made  an 
c offering unto the Lord, and gave 
d thanks unto the Lord our God.

8 And it came to pass that he called 
the name of the river, Laman, and 
it  emptied  into  the  Red  Sea;  and 
the valley was in the borders near 
the mouth thereof.

9 And  when  my  father  saw  that 
the  waters  of  the  river  emptied 
into the a fountain of the Red Sea, 
he  spake  unto  Laman,  saying:  O 
that thou mightest be like unto this 
river, continually running into the 
fountain of all righteousness!

10 And he also spake unto Lem-
uel:  O  that  thou  mightest  be  like 
unto this valley, a firm and b stead-
fast, and immovable in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord!

11 Now this he spake because of 
the a stiffneckedness of Laman and 

Lemuel; for behold they did b mur-
mur in many things against their 
c father, because he was a d visionary 
man, and had led them out of the 
land of Jerusalem, to leave the land 
of their inheritance, and their gold, 
and their silver, and their precious 
things, to perish in the wilderness. 
And this they said he had done be-
cause  of  the  foolish  imaginations 
of his heart.

12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, 
being the eldest, did murmur against 
their a father. And they did b murmur 
because  they  c knew  not  the  deal-
ings of that God who had d created  
them.

13 Neither did they a believe that 
Jerusalem, that great city, could be 
b destroyed according to the words 
of the prophets. And they were like 
unto the Jews who were at Jerusa-
lem, who sought to take away the 
life of my father.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
father did speak unto them in the 
a valley  of  Lemuel,  with  b power, 
being  filled  with  the  Spirit,  until 
their frames did c shake before him. 
And  he  did  confound  them,  that 
they  durst  not  utter  against  him; 
wherefore,  they  did  as  he  com-
manded them.

15 And my father dwelt in a a tent.
16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  being  exceedingly  young, 
nevertheless  being  large  in  stat-

wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; 
and  behold  he  did  b visit  me,  and 
did c soften my heart that I did d be-
lieve all the words which had been 
spoken by my e father; wherefore, I 
did not f rebel against him like unto 
my brothers.

17 And I spake unto Sam, making 
known unto him the things which 
the Lord had manifested unto me 
by his Holy Spirit. And it came to 
pass that he believed in my words.
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel 
would not hearken unto my words; 
and being a grieved because of the 
hardness of their hearts I cried unto 
the Lord for them.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed 
art  thou,  Nephi,  because  of  thy 
a faith,  for  thou  hast  sought  me 
diligently, with lowliness of heart.
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep 
my commandments, ye shall a pros-
per, and shall be led to a b land of 
promise; yea, even a land which I 
have prepared for you; yea, a land 
which  is  choice  above  all  other 
lands.

21 And inasmuch as thy brethren 
shall rebel against thee, they shall 
be  a cut  off  from  the  presence  of 
the Lord.

22 And  inasmuch  as  thou  shalt  
keep  my  commandments,  thou  
shalt be made a a ruler and a teacher 
over thy brethren.

23 For  behold,  in  that  day  that 
they shall a rebel against me, I will 
b curse them even with a sore curse, 
and they shall have no power over 

thy  seed  except  they  shall  c rebel 
against me also.

24 And if it so be that they rebel 
against me, they shall be a a scourge 
unto thy seed, to  b stir them up in 
the ways of remembrance.

CHAPTER 3
Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to ob-
tain the plates of brass—Laban refuses 
to  give  the  plates  up—Nephi  exhorts 
and  encourages  his  brethren—Laban 
steals  their  property  and  attempts  to 
slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite 
Nephi  and  Sam  and  are  reproved  by 
an angel. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
returned from a speaking with the 
Lord, to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that he spake 
unto  me,  saying:  Behold  I  have 
dreamed  a  a dream,  in  the  which 
the Lord hath commanded me that 
thou and thy brethren shall b return 
to Jerusalem.

3 For  behold,  Laban  hath  the 
record of the Jews and also a  a ge-
nealogy  of  my  forefathers,  and 
they are b engraven upon plates of  
brass.

4 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded  me  that  thou  and  thy 
brothers should go unto the house 
of Laban, and seek the records, and 
bring  them  down  hither  into  the 
wilderness.

5 And  now,  behold  thy  brothers 
murmur, saying it is a hard thing 
which I have required of them; but 
behold  I  have  not  required  it  of

them, but it is a commandment of 
the Lord.

6 Therefore go, my son, and thou 
shalt be favored of the Lord, because 
thou hast a not b murmured.

7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
said unto my father: I a will go and 
do the things which the Lord hath 
commanded,  for  I  know  that  the 
Lord  giveth  no  b commandments 
unto the children of men, save he 
shall c prepare a way for them that 
they  may  accomplish  the  thing 
which he commandeth them.

8 And it came to pass that when 
my father had heard these words he 
was exceedingly glad, for he knew 
that I had been blessed of the Lord.
9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren 
took our journey in the wilderness, 
with our tents, to go up to the land 
of Jerusalem.

10 And it came to pass that when 
we had gone up to the land of Je-
rusalem,  I  and  my  brethren  did 
consult one with another.

11 And  we  a cast  lots—who  of  us 
should go in unto the house of Laban.  
And it came to pass that the lot fell 
upon Laman; and Laman went in 
unto  the  house  of  Laban,  and  he 
talked  with  him  as  he  sat  in  his 
house.

12 And  he  desired  of  Laban  the 
records which were engraven upon 
the plates of brass, which contained 
the a genealogy of my father.

13 And  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
that Laban was angry, and thrust 
him out from his presence; and he 
would not that he should have the 
records.  Wherefore,  he  said  unto 
him: Behold thou art a robber, and 
I will slay thee.

14 But Laman fled out of his pres-
ence, and told the things which La-
ban had done, unto us. And we began  
to  be  exceedingly  sorrowful,  and 
my brethren were about to return  
unto my father in the wilderness.

15 But  behold  I  said  unto  them 
that: a As the Lord liveth, and as we  
live, we will not go down unto our 
father  in  the  wilderness  until  we 
have b accomplished the thing which 
the Lord hath commanded us.

16 Wherefore,  let  us  be  faithful 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord; therefore let us go down 
to the land of our father’s a inheri-
tance, for behold he left gold and 
silver,  and  all  manner  of  riches. 
And all this he hath done because 
of the b commandments of the Lord.
17 For  he  knew  that  Jerusalem 
must be a destroyed, because of the 
wickedness of the people.

18 For behold, they have a rejected 
the words of the prophets. Where-
fore, if my father should dwell in the 
land after he hath been b commanded  
to flee out of the land, behold, he 
would  also  perish.  Wherefore,  it 
must needs be that he flee out of 
the land.

19 And  behold,  it  is  wisdom  in  
God  that  we  should  obtain  these 
a records,  that  we  may  preserve 
unto our children the language of 
our fathers;

20 And also that we may a preserve  
unto  them  the  words  which  have 
been  spoken  by  the  mouth  of  all 
the  holy  b prophets,  which  have 
been  delivered  unto  them  by  the 
Spirit and power of God, since the 
world began, even down unto this 
present time.

1 NEPHI 3  : 21–4  : 2

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  af-
ter this manner of language did I 
a persuade  my  brethren,  that  they 
might  be  faithful  in  keeping  the 
commandments of God.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
went down to the land of our inheri-
tance, and we did gather together 
our  a gold, and our silver, and our 
precious things.

23 And after we had gathered these 
things together, we went up again 
unto the house of Laban.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
went  in  unto  Laban,  and  desired 
him that he would give unto us the 
records which were engraven upon  
the  a plates  of  brass,  for  which  we 
would give unto him our gold, and our  
silver, and all our precious things.

25 And it came to pass that when 
Laban saw our property, and that it 
was exceedingly great, he did a lust 
after it, insomuch that he thrust us 
out, and sent his servants to slay us, 
that he might obtain our property.
26 And  a it  came  to  pass  that  we 
did flee before the servants of La-
ban, and we were obliged to leave 
behind our property, and it fell into 
the hands of Laban.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
fled  into  the  wilderness,  and  the 
servants of Laban did not overtake 
us,  and  we  a hid  ourselves  in  the 
cavity of a rock.

28 And it came to pass that Laman 
was angry with me, and also with 
my  father;  and  also  was  Lemuel, 
for  he  hearkened  unto  the  words 
of  Laman.  Wherefore  Laman  and 
Lemuel did speak many a hard words 
unto us, their younger brothers, and 
they did smite us even with a rod.
29 And  it  came  to  pass  as  they  

smote  us  with  a  rod,  behold,  an 
a angel of the Lord came and stood 
before  them,  and  he  spake  unto 
them, saying: Why do ye smite your 
younger brother with a rod? Know 
ye  not  that  the  Lord  hath  chosen 
him to be a b ruler over you, and this 
because of your iniquities? Behold 
ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, 
and  the  Lord  will  c deliver  Laban 
into your hands.

30 And after the  a angel had spo-

ken unto us, he departed.

31 And  after  the  angel  had  de-
parted,  Laman  and  Lemuel  again 
began to a murmur, saying: How is 
it possible that the Lord will deliver 
Laban into our hands? Behold, he 
is a mighty man, and he can com-
mand  fifty,  yea,  even  he  can  slay 
fifty; then why not us?

CHAPTER 4
Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s com-
mand  and  then  secures  the  plates  of 
brass  by  stratagem—Zoram  chooses 
to join Lehi’s family in the wilderness. 
About 600–592 b.c.

And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  spake 
unto  my  brethren,  saying:  Let  us 
go  up  again  unto  Jerusalem,  and 
let  us  be  a faithful  in  keeping  the 
commandments  of  the  Lord;  for 
behold he is mightier than all the 
earth, then why not b mightier than 
Laban  and  his  fifty,  yea,  or  even 
than his tens of thousands?

2 Therefore  let  us  go  up;  let  us 
be a strong like unto Moses; for he 
truly spake unto the waters of the 
b Red Sea and they divided hither 
and thither, and our fathers came 
through,  out  of  captivity,  on  dry 
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh

did follow and were drowned in the 
waters of the Red Sea.

3 Now behold ye know that this is 
true; and ye also know that an a an-
gel hath spoken unto you; where-
fore can ye b doubt? Let us go up; the 
Lord is able to c deliver us, even as 
our fathers, and to destroy Laban, 
even as the Egyptians.

4 Now  when  I  had  spoken  these 
words, they were yet wroth, and did  
still continue to murmur; neverthe-
less they did follow me up until we 
came without the walls of Jerusalem.
5 And it was by night; and I caused 
that  they  should  hide  themselves 
without the walls. And after they 
had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept 
into the city and went forth towards 
the house of Laban.

6 And I was a led by the Spirit, not 
b knowing  beforehand  the  things 
which I should do.

7 Nevertheless  I  went  forth,  and 
as  I  came  near  unto  the  house  of 
Laban I beheld a man, and he had 
fallen to the earth before me, for 
he was a drunken with wine.

8 And when I came to him I found 

that it was Laban.

9 And  I  beheld  his  a sword,  and 
I  drew  it  forth  from  the  sheath 
thereof;  and  the  hilt  thereof  was 
of pure gold, and the workmanship 
thereof was exceedingly fine, and 
I saw that the blade thereof was of 
the most precious steel.

10 And it came to pass that I was 
a constrained  by  the  Spirit  that  I 
should kill Laban; but I said in my 
heart: Never at any time have I shed 
the blood of man. And I shrunk and 
would that I might not slay him.

11 And  the  Spirit  said  unto  me 
again: Behold the a Lord hath b deliv-
ered him into thy hands. Yea, and 
I also knew that he had sought to 
take away mine own life; yea, and 
he  would  not  hearken  unto  the 
commandments of the Lord; and he 
also had c taken away our property.
12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, 
for  the  Lord  hath  delivered  him 
into thy hands;

13 Behold  the  Lord  a slayeth  the 
b wicked  to  bring  forth  his  righ-
teous  purposes.  It  is  c better  that 
one man should perish than that a 
nation should dwindle and perish 
in d unbelief.

14 And now, when I, Nephi, had 
heard these words, I remembered 
the  words  of  the  Lord  which  he 
spake  unto  me  in  the  wilderness, 
saying that: a Inasmuch as thy seed 
shall  keep  my  b commandments, 
they shall c prosper in the d land of 
promise.

15 Yea, and I also thought that they 
could not keep the commandments 
of the Lord according to the a law of  
Moses, save they should have the law.
16 And I also knew that the a law 
was  engraven  upon  the  plates  of 
brass.

17 And again, I knew that the Lord  
had delivered Laban into my hands 
for this cause—that I might obtain 
the records according to his com-
mandments.

18 Therefore I did obey the voice 
of  the  Spirit,  and  took  Laban  by 
the hair of the head, and I smote 
off his head with his own a sword.

head with his own sword, I took the 
garments  of  Laban  and  put  them 
upon  mine  own  body;  yea,  even 
every  whit;  and  I  did  gird  on  his 
armor about my loins.

20 And after I had done this, I went 
forth unto the treasury of Laban. 
And  as  I  went  forth  towards  the 
treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the 
a servant of Laban who had the keys 
of the treasury. And I commanded 
him in the voice of Laban, that he 
should go with me into the treasury.
21 And he supposed me to be his 
master,  Laban,  for  he  beheld  the 
garments and also the sword girded 
about my loins.

22 And  he  spake  unto  me  con-
cerning the a elders of the Jews, he 
knowing  that  his  master,  Laban, 
had been out by night among them.
23 And I spake unto him as if it 

had been Laban.

24 And I also spake unto him that I 
should carry the engravings, which 
were upon the  a plates of brass, to 
my elder brethren, who were with-
out the walls.

25 And  I  also  bade  him  that  he 

should follow me.

26 And he, supposing that I spake 
of the a brethren of the b church, and 
that I was truly that Laban whom 
I had slain, wherefore he did fol-
low me.

27 And  he  spake  unto  me  many 
times concerning the elders of the 
Jews, as I went forth unto my breth-
ren, who were without the walls.

28 And it came to pass that when 
Laman saw me he was exceedingly 
frightened,  and  also  Lemuel  and 
Sam.  And  they  fled  from  before 
my presence; for they supposed it 
was Laban, and that he had slain 
me  and  had  sought  to  take  away 
their lives also.

29 And it came to pass that I called 

after them, and they did hear me; 
wherefore  they  did  cease  to  flee 
from my presence.

30 And it came to pass that when 
the  servant  of  Laban  beheld  my 
brethren he began to tremble, and 
was about to flee from before me 
and return to the city of Jerusalem.
31 And now I, Nephi, being a man 
large in stature, and also having re-
ceived much a strength of the Lord, 
therefore I did seize upon the ser-
vant of Laban, and held him, that 
he should not flee.

32 And it came to pass that I spake 
with him, that if he would hearken 
unto my words, as the Lord liveth, 
and as I live, even so that if he would 
hearken unto our words, we would 
spare his life.

33 And  I  spake  unto  him,  even 
with an a oath, that he need not fear; 
that he should be a b free man like 
unto us if he would go down in the 
wilderness with us.

34 And  I  also  spake  unto  him, 
saying: Surely the Lord hath a com-
manded us to do this thing; and shall 
we not be diligent in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord? There-
fore, if thou wilt go down into the 
wilderness to my father thou shalt 
have place with us.

35 And it came to pass that a Zoram 
did take courage at the words which 
I spake. Now Zoram was the name of  
the servant; and he promised that he  
would go down into the wilderness 
unto  our  father.  Yea,  and  he  also 
made an oath unto us that he would 
tarry with us from that time forth.
36 Now we were desirous that he 
should tarry with us for this cause, 
that the Jews might not know con-
cerning our flight into the wilder-
ness, lest they should pursue us and 
destroy us.

Zoram had made an a oath unto us, 
our b fears did cease concerning him.
38 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
took the plates of brass and the ser-
vant  of  Laban,  and  departed  into 
the wilderness, and journeyed unto 
the a tent of our father.

CHAPTER 5

Sariah complains against Lehi—Both 
rejoice over the return of their sons—
They  offer  sacrifices—The  plates  of 
brass contain writings of Moses and the 
prophets—The plates identify Lehi as a 
descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophesies 
concerning his seed and the preserva-
tion of the plates. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that after we 
had come down into the wilderness 
unto our father, behold, he was filled 
with joy, and also my mother, Sa-
riah, was exceedingly glad, for she 
truly had mourned because of us.
2 For  she  had  supposed  that  we 
had perished in the wilderness; and 
she  also  had  a complained  against 
my father, telling him that he was 
a  b visionary  man;  saying:  Behold 
thou hast led us forth from the land 
of  our  inheritance,  and  my  sons 
are no more, and we perish in the 
wilderness.

3 And  after  this  manner  of  lan-
guage had my mother complained 
against my father.

4 And  it  had  come  to  pass  that 
my father spake unto her, saying: 
I know that I am a a visionary man; 
for if I had not seen the things of 
God in a b vision I should not have 
known  the  goodness  of  God,  but 
had tarried at Jerusalem, and had 
perished with my brethren.

5 But  behold,  I  have  a obtained  a 
b land of promise, in the which things 
I do rejoice; yea, and I  c know that 
the Lord will deliver my sons out of 
the hands of Laban, and bring them 
down again unto us in the wilderness.
6 And  after  this  manner  of  lan-
guage did my father, Lehi, a comfort 
my mother, Sariah, concerning us, 
while we journeyed in the wilder-
ness  up  to  the  land  of  Jerusalem, 
to obtain the record of the Jews.

7 And when we had returned to 
the tent of my father, behold their 
joy  was  full,  and  my  mother  was 
comforted.

8 And  she  spake,  saying:  Now  I 
know of a surety that the Lord hath 
a commanded my husband to b flee 
into the wilderness; yea, and I also 
know of a surety that the Lord hath 
protected  my  sons,  and  delivered 
them  out  of  the  hands  of  Laban, 
and  given  them  power  whereby 
they  could  c accomplish  the  thing 
which the Lord hath commanded 
them.  And  after  this  manner  of 
language did she speak.

9 And it came to pass that they did 
rejoice exceedingly, and did offer 
a sacrifice and burnt offerings unto 
the  Lord;  and  they  gave  b thanks 
unto the God of Israel.

10 And after they had given thanks 
unto the God of Israel, my father, 
Lehi, took the records which were 
engraven upon the a plates of brass, 
and he did search them from the 
beginning.

11 And  he  beheld  that  they  did 
contain  the  five  a books  of  Moses, 
which gave an account of the cre-
ation of the world, and also of Adam 
and Eve, who were our first parents;

12 And also a a record of the Jews 
from the beginning, even down to 
the commencement of the reign of 
Zedekiah, king of Judah;

13 And also the prophecies of the 
holy prophets, from the beginning, 
even down to the commencement 
of the reign of a Zedekiah; and also 
many prophecies which have been 
spoken by the mouth of b Jeremiah.
14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
father,  Lehi,  also  found  upon  the 
a plates of brass a b genealogy of his 
c fathers;  wherefore  he  knew  that 
he  was  a  descendant  of  d Joseph; 
yea, even that Joseph who was the 
son  of  e Jacob,  who  was  f sold  into 
Egypt, and who was g preserved by 
the hand of the Lord, that he might 
preserve his father, Jacob, and all 
his household from perishing with  
famine.

15 And  they  were  also  a led  out 
of captivity and out of the land of 
Egypt, by that same God who had 
preserved them.

16 And thus my father, Lehi, did 
discover the genealogy of his fathers. 
And Laban also was a descendant 
of  a Joseph,  wherefore  he  and  his 
fathers had kept the b records.

17 And now when my father saw 
all these things, he was filled with 
the Spirit, and began to prophesy 
concerning his seed—

18 That  these  a plates  of  brass 
should go forth unto all  b nations, 
kindreds, tongues, and people who 
were of his seed.

19 Wherefore, he said that these 

plates of brass should a never perish; 
neither should they be dimmed any 
more by time. And he prophesied 
many things concerning his seed.

20 And it came to pass that thus 
far  I  and  my  father  had  kept  the 
commandments  wherewith  the 
Lord had commanded us.

21 And we had obtained the records 
which the Lord had commanded us, 
and searched them and found that 
they  were  desirable;  yea,  even  of  
great a worth unto us, insomuch that 
we could b preserve the command-
ments of the Lord unto our children.
22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the 
Lord that we should carry them with 
us, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness towards the land of promise.

CHAPTER 6

Nephi  writes  of  the  things  of  God—
Nephi’s purpose is to persuade men to 
come unto the God of Abraham and be 
saved. About 600–592 b.c.
And now I, Nephi, do not give the 
genealogy  of  my  fathers  in  a this 
part of my record; neither at any 
time shall I give it after upon these 
b plates which I am c writing; for it is 
given in the record which has been 
kept by my d father; wherefore, I do 
not write it in this work.

2 For it sufficeth me to say that we 

are descendants of a Joseph.

3 And it mattereth not to me that I 
am particular to give a full account 
of all the things of my father, for

plates,  for  I  desire  the  room  that 
I may write of the things of God.

4 For the fulness of mine intent is 
that I may a persuade men to b come 
unto the God of Abraham, and the 
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, 
and be saved.

5 Wherefore,  the  things  which 
are  a pleasing unto the world I do 
not write, but the things which are 
pleasing unto God and unto those 
who are not of the world.

6 Wherefore,  I  shall  give  com-
mandment unto my seed, that they 
shall not occupy these plates with 
things which are not of worth unto 
the children of men.

CHAPTER 7
Lehi’s  sons  return  to  Jerusalem  and  
invite  Ishmael  and  his  household  to  
join  them  in  their  journey—Laman 
and  others  rebel—Nephi  exhorts  his  
brethren  to  have  faith  in  the  Lord—
They bind him with cords and plan his  
destruction—He is freed by the power 
of faith—His brethren ask forgiveness—
Lehi  and  his  company  offer  sacrifice 
and burnt offerings. About 600–592 b.c.

And  now  I  would  that  ye  might 
know,  that  after  my  father,  Lehi, 
had made an end of a prophesying 
concerning his seed, it came to pass 
that the Lord spake unto him again, 
saying that it was not meet for him, 
Lehi, that he should take his fam-
ily into the wilderness alone; but 
that  his  sons  should  take  b daugh-
ters to c wife, that they might raise 
up d seed unto the Lord in the land  
of promise.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord 
a commanded him that I, Nephi, and 
my brethren, should again return 
unto  the  land  of  Jerusalem,  and 

bring down Ishmael and his family 
into the wilderness.

3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  a again,  with  my  brethren,  go 
forth into the wilderness to go up 
to Jerusalem.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  
went up unto the house of Ishmael, 
and we did gain favor in the sight 
of Ishmael, insomuch that we did 
speak  unto  him  the  words  of  the  
Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the a Lord 
did  soften  the  heart  of  Ishmael, 
and also his household, insomuch 
that they took their journey with 
us down into the wilderness to the 
tent of our father.

6 And it came to pass that as we 
journeyed  in  the  wilderness,  be-
hold Laman and Lemuel, and two 
of the  a daughters of Ishmael, and 
the two b sons of Ishmael and their 
families, did c rebel against us; yea, 
against  me,  Nephi,  and  Sam,  and 
their father, Ishmael, and his wife, 
and his three other daughters.

7 And it came to pass in the which 
rebellion, they were desirous to re-
turn unto the land of Jerusalem.

8 And now I, Nephi, being a grieved 
for  the  hardness  of  their  hearts, 
therefore  I  spake  unto  them,  say-
ing, yea, even unto Laman and unto 
Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder 
brethren,  and  how  is  it  that  ye 
are so hard in your hearts, and so 
blind in your minds, that ye have 
need that I, your b younger brother, 
should speak unto you, yea, and set 
an c example for you?

9 How is it that ye have not heark-

ened unto the word of the Lord?

10 How is it that ye have a forgot-
ten that ye have seen an angel of 
the Lord?

11 Yea, and how is it that ye have 
forgotten  what  great  things  the 
Lord hath done for us, in a delivering  
us out of the hands of Laban, and 
also  that  we  should  obtain  the  
record?

12 Yea, and how is it that ye have 
forgotten  that  the  Lord  is  able  to 
do all a things according to his will, 
for the children of men, if it so be 
that  they  exercise  b faith  in  him? 
Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.
13 And if it so be that we are faith-
ful to him, we shall obtain the a land 
of  promise;  and  ye  shall  know  at 
some future period that the word of 
the Lord shall be fulfilled concern-
ing the b destruction of c Jerusalem;  
for all things which the Lord hath 
spoken concerning the destruction 
of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

14 For  behold,  the  a Spirit  of  the 
Lord  b ceaseth  soon  to  strive  with 
them;  for  behold,  they  have  c re-
jected the prophets, and d Jeremiah 
have they cast into prison. And they 
have sought to take away the e life 
of  my  father,  insomuch  that  they 
have driven him out of the land.

15 Now behold, I say unto you that 
if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye 
shall  also  perish  with  them.  And 
now,  if  ye  have  choice,  go  up  to 
the land, and remember the words 
which I speak unto you, that if ye 
go ye will also perish; for thus the 
Spirit of the Lord constraineth me 
that I should speak.

16 And it came to pass that when 
I,  Nephi,  had  spoken  these  words 
unto my brethren, they were angry 
with me. And it came to pass that 
they did lay their hands upon me, 
for behold, they were exceedingly 
wroth, and they did a bind me with 

cords, for they sought to take away 
my life, that they might leave me 
in  the  wilderness  to  be  devoured 
by wild beasts.

17 But it came to pass that I prayed 
unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, ac-
cording to my faith which is in thee, 
wilt thou deliver me from the hands 
of my brethren; yea, even give me 
a strength  that  I  may  b burst  these 
bands with which I am bound.

18 And it came to pass that when 
I had said these words, behold, the 
bands  were  loosed  from  off  my 
hands and feet, and I stood before 
my brethren, and I spake unto them  
again.

19 And it came to pass that they 
were  angry  with  me  again,  and 
sought to lay hands upon me; but 
behold,  one  of  the  a daughters  of 
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, 
and one of the sons of Ishmael, did 
plead with my brethren, insomuch 
that  they  did  soften  their  hearts; 
and they did cease striving to take 
away my life.

20 And it came to pass that they 
were  sorrowful,  because  of  their 
wickedness,  insomuch  that  they 
did bow down before me, and did 
plead with me that I would a forgive 
them  of  the  thing  that  they  had 
done against me.

21 And it came to pass that I did 
frankly a forgive them all that they 
had  done,  and  I  did  exhort  them 
that they would pray unto the Lord 
their God for  b forgiveness. And it 
came to pass that they did so. And 
after they had done praying unto 
the  Lord  we  did  again  travel  on 
our journey towards the tent of our  
father.

22 And it came to pass that we did

come  down  unto  the  tent  of  our 
father. And after I and my brethren 
and all the house of Ishmael had come 
down unto the tent of my father, they 
did give a thanks unto the Lord their 
God;  and  they  did  offer  b sacrifice 
and burnt offerings unto him.

CHAPTER 8

Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life—
He partakes of its fruit and desires his 
family to do likewise—He sees a rod of 
iron, a strait and narrow path, and the 
mists of darkness that enshroud men—
Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the 
fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse. 
About 600–592 b.c.
And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  had 
gathered  together  all  manner  of 
a seeds of every kind, both of grain 
of every kind, and also of the seeds 
of fruit of every kind.

2 And it came to pass that while 
my father tarried in the wilderness 
he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I 
have a dreamed a dream; or, in other 
words, I have b seen a c vision.

3 And behold, because of the thing 
which I have seen, I have reason to 
rejoice in the Lord because of a Nephi 
and also of Sam; for I have reason 
to suppose that they, and also many 
of their seed, will be saved.

4 But behold, a Laman and Lemuel, 
I fear exceedingly because of you; 
for behold, methought I saw in my  
dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.
5 And it came to pass that I saw 
a  a man,  and  he  was  dressed  in  a 
white b robe; and he came and stood 
before me.

6 And it came to pass that he spake 
unto me, and bade me follow him.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  as  I 
followed him I beheld myself that 
I was in a dark and dreary waste.

8 And after I had traveled for the 
space of many hours in darkness, I 
began to pray unto the Lord that he 
would have a mercy on me, accord-
ing to the multitude of his tender 
mercies.

9 And it came to pass after I had 
prayed  unto  the  Lord  I  beheld  a 
large and spacious a field.

10 And it came to pass that I beheld 
a a tree, whose b fruit was desirable 
to make one c happy.

11 And it came to pass that I did 
go forth and partake of the  a fruit 
thereof; and I beheld that it was most 
sweet, above all that I ever before 
tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the 
fruit thereof was white, to exceed 
all the  b whiteness that I had ever  
seen.

12 And  as  I  partook  of  the  fruit 
thereof  it  filled  my  soul  with  ex-
ceedingly  great  a joy;  wherefore,  I 
began to be b desirous that my family  
should partake of it also; for I knew 
that it was c desirable above all other  
fruit.

13 And  as  I  cast  my  eyes  round 
about, that perhaps I might discover 
my family also, I beheld a a river of 
water; and it ran along, and it was 
near the tree of which I was par-
taking the fruit.

14 And  I  looked  to  behold  from 
whence it came; and I saw the head 
thereof a little way off; and at the 
head thereof I beheld your mother 
Sariah, and Sam, and  a Nephi; and 
they  stood  as  if  they  knew  not 
whither they should go.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I

beckoned unto them; and I also did 
say  unto  them  with  a  loud  voice 
that they should come unto me, and 
partake of the fruit, which was de-
sirable above all other fruit.

16 And it came to pass that they 
did come unto me and partake of 
the fruit also.

17 And it came to pass that I was 
desirous  that  Laman  and  Lemuel 
should  come  and  partake  of  the 
fruit  also;  wherefore,  I  cast  mine 
eyes towards the head of the river, 
that perhaps I might see them.

18 And it came to pass that I saw 
them,  but  they  would  a not  come 
unto me and partake of the fruit.

19 And I beheld a a rod of iron, and 
it extended along the bank of the 
river, and led to the tree by which 
I stood.

20 And I also beheld a a strait and 
narrow path, which came along by 
the rod of iron, even to the tree by 
which I stood; and it also led by the 
head of the fountain, unto a large 
and spacious field, as if it had been 
a b world.

21 And  I  saw  numberless  con-
courses of people, many of whom 
were  a pressing forward, that they 
might obtain the  b path which led 
unto the tree by which I stood.

22 And it came to pass that they 
did come forth, and commence in 
the path which led to the tree.

23 And it came to pass that there 
arose a a mist of darkness; yea, even 
an exceedingly great mist of dark-
ness, insomuch that they who had 
commenced in the path did lose their  

way,  that  they  wandered  off  and 
were b lost.

24 And it came to pass that I be-
held others pressing forward, and 
they came forth and caught hold of 
the end of the rod of iron; and they 
did press forward through the mist 
of darkness, a clinging to the rod of 
iron, even until they did come forth 
and partake of the b fruit of the tree.
25 And after they had partaken of 
the fruit of the tree they did cast 
their  eyes  about  as  if  they  were 
a ashamed.

26 And I also cast my eyes round 
about,  and  beheld,  on  the  a other 
side of the river of water, a great 
and b spacious building; and it stood 
as  it  were  in  the  c air,  high  above 
the earth.

27 And it was filled with people, 
both old and young, both male and 
female; and their manner of dress 
was  exceedingly  fine;  and  they 
were in the  a attitude of  b mocking 
and pointing their fingers towards 
those  who  had  come  at  and  were 
partaking of the fruit.

28 And after they had  a tasted of 
the fruit they were  b ashamed, be-
cause of those that were  c scoffing 
at  them;  and  they  d fell  away  into 
forbidden paths and were lost.

29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak 

a all the words of my father.

30 But,  to  be  short  in  writing, 
behold,  he  saw  other  multitudes 
pressing  forward;  and  they  came 
and caught hold of the end of the 
a rod of iron; and they did press their 
way forward, continually holding

fast to the rod of iron, until they 
came forth and fell down and par-
took of the fruit of the tree.

31 And  he  also  saw  other  a mul-
titudes  feeling  their  way  towards 
that great and spacious building.

32 And it came to pass that many 
were  drowned  in  the  a depths  of 
the b fountain; and many were lost 
from his view, wandering in strange  
roads.

33 And  great  was  the  multitude 
that  did  enter  into  that  strange 
building. And after they did enter 
into  that  building  they  did  point 
the  finger  of  a scorn  at  me  and  
those  that  were  partaking  of  the 
fruit also; but we heeded them not.
34 These  are  the  words  of  my 
father:  For  as  many  as  a heeded 
them, had fallen away.

35 And a Laman and Lemuel par-
took  not  of  the  fruit,  said  my  
father.

36 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father had spoken all the words of 
his  dream  or  vision,  which  were 
many,  he  said  unto  us,  because 
of these things which he saw in a 
vision,  he  exceedingly  feared  for 
Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared 
lest  they  should  be  cast  off  from 
the presence of the Lord.

37 And he did a exhort them then 
with all the feeling of a tender par-
ent, that they would hearken to his 
words, that perhaps the Lord would 
be merciful to them, and not cast 
them off; yea, my father did preach 
unto them.

38 And  after  he  had  preached  
unto them, and also prophesied unto 
them of many things, he bade them 

to keep the commandments of the 
Lord;  and  he  did  cease  speaking 
unto them.

CHAPTER 9

Nephi makes two sets of records—Each 
is called the plates of Nephi—The larger 
plates  contain  a  secular  history;  the 
smaller ones deal primarily with sacred 
things. About 600–592 b.c.
And all these things did my father 
see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt 
in a tent, in the a valley of Lemuel, 
and also a great many more things, 
which cannot be written upon these 
plates.

2 And now, as I have spoken con-
cerning  these  plates,  behold  they 
are  not  the  plates  upon  which  I 
make a full account of the history 
of my people; for the a plates upon 
which I make a full account of my 
people  I  have  given  the  name  of 
Nephi; wherefore, they are called 
the plates of Nephi, after mine own 
name;  and  these  plates  also  are 
called the plates of Nephi.

3 Nevertheless, I have received a 
commandment  of  the  Lord  that  I 
should  make  these  plates,  for  the 
special a purpose that there should 
be an account engraven of the b min-
istry of my people.

4 Upon the other plates should be 
engraven an account of the reign 
of the kings, and the wars and con-
tentions  of  my  people;  wherefore 
these plates are for the more part of 
the ministry; and the a other plates 
are for the more part of the reign 
of the kings and the wars and con-
tentions of my people.

5 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded  me  to  make  these  plates 
for a a wise purpose in him, which 
purpose I know not.

6 But the Lord a knoweth all things 
from the beginning; wherefore, he 
prepareth a way to accomplish all 
his  works  among  the  children  of 
men; for behold, he hath all b power 
unto the fulfilling of all his words. 
And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 10
Lehi predicts that the Jews will be taken 
captive by the Babylonians—He tells of 
the coming among the Jews of a Mes-
siah, a Savior, a Redeemer—Lehi tells 
also of the coming of the one who should 
baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of 
the death and resurrection of the Mes-
siah—He compares the scattering and 
gathering  of  Israel  to  an  olive  tree—
Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, and of the need 
for righteousness. About 600–592 b.c.
And now I, Nephi, proceed to give 
an  account  upon  a these  plates  of 
my proceedings, and my reign and 
ministry; wherefore, to proceed with 
mine account, I must speak some-
what  of  the  things  of  my  father, 
and also of my brethren.

2 For behold, it came to pass af-
ter my father had made an end of 
speaking the words of his a dream, 
and also of exhorting  them to  all 
diligence, he spake unto them con-
cerning the Jews—

3 That  after  they  should  be  de-
stroyed, even that great city a Jeru-
salem, and many be b carried away 
captive into c Babylon, according to 
the own due time of the Lord, they 
should d return again, yea, even be 
brought back out of captivity; and 
after they should be brought back 
out of captivity they should possess 
again the land of their inheritance.
4 Yea,  even  a six  hundred  years 
from the time that my father left 
Jerusalem,  a  b prophet  would  the 
Lord God raise up among the c Jews—
even a d Messiah, or, in other words, 
a Savior of the world.

5 And he also spake concerning the 
prophets, how great a number had 
a testified of these things, concerning 
this Messiah, of whom he had spo-
ken, or this Redeemer of the world.
6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a 
a lost and in a b fallen state, and ever 
would be save they should rely on 
this Redeemer.

7 And he spake also concerning a 
a prophet who should come before 
the Messiah, to prepare the way of 
the Lord—

8 Yea, even he should go forth and 
cry in the wilderness: a Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord, and make his 
paths  straight;  for  there  standeth 
one among you whom ye know not; 
and  he  is  mightier  than  I,  whose 
shoe’s  latchet  I  am  not  worthy  to 
unloose. And much spake my father  
concerning this thing.

baptize  in  a Bethabara,  beyond  
Jordan; and he also said he should 
b baptize with water; even that he 
should  baptize  the  Messiah  with 
water.

10 And after he had baptized the 
Messiah with water, he should be-
hold and bear record that he had 
baptized  the  a Lamb  of  God,  who 
should  take  away  the  sins  of  the 
world.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father had spoken these words he 
spake unto my brethren concern-
ing  the  gospel  which  should  be 
preached among the Jews, and also 
concerning the  a dwindling of the 
Jews  in  b unbelief.  And  after  they 
had c slain the Messiah, who should 
come, and after he had been slain 
he should d rise from the dead, and 
should make himself e manifest, by 
the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.
12 Yea, even my father spake much 
concerning the Gentiles, and also 
concerning the house of Israel, that 
they should be compared like unto 
an  a olive  tree,  whose  b branches 
should  be  broken  off  and  should 
be  c scattered upon all the face of 
the earth.

13 Wherefore, he said it must needs 
be that we should be led with one 
accord  into  the  a land  of  promise, 
unto the fulfilling of the word of 
the  Lord,  that  we  should  be  scat-
tered upon all the face of the earth.

14 And after the house of a Israel 
should be scattered they should be 
b gathered together again; or, in fine, 
after the c Gentiles had received the 
fulness of the d Gospel, the natural 
branches of the  e olive tree, or the 
f remnants  of  the  house  of  g Israel, 
should be grafted in, or h come to the  
knowledge of the true Messiah, their 
Lord and their Redeemer.

15 And after this manner of lan-
guage  did  my  father  prophesy 
and speak unto my brethren, and 
also many more things which I do 
not  write  in  this  book;  for  I  have  
written  as  many  of  them  as  were 
expedient  for  me  in  mine  a other  
book.

16 And all these things, of which 
I  have  spoken,  were  done  as  my 
father dwelt in a a tent, in the val-
ley of Lemuel.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  after  I, 
Nephi, having heard all the a words 
of my father, concerning the things 
which he saw in a b vision, and also 
the things which he spake by the 
power  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  which 
power he received by faith on the 
Son of God—and the Son of God was 
the c Messiah who should come—I, 
Nephi,  was  d desirous  also  that  I 
might see, and hear, and know of 
these  things,  by  the  power  of  the 
e Holy  Ghost,  which  is  the  f gift  of 
God unto g all those who diligently 
seek him, as well in times of  h old

as in the time that he should mani-
fest  himself  unto  the  children  of  
men.

18 For he is the a same yesterday, 
today, and forever; and the way is 
prepared for all men from the foun-
dation of the world, if it so be that 
they repent and come unto him.

19 For he that diligently a seeketh 
shall find; and the b mysteries of God 
shall be unfolded unto them, by the 
power of the c Holy Ghost, as well in 
these times as in times of old, and 
as well in times of old as in times 
to come; wherefore, the d course of 
the Lord is one eternal round.

20 Therefore  remember,  O  man, 
for  all  thy  doings  thou  shalt  be 
brought into a judgment.

21 Wherefore,  if  ye  have  sought 
to do a wickedly in the days of your 
b probation, then ye are found c un-
clean before the judgment-seat of 
God; and no unclean thing can dwell 
with  God;  wherefore,  ye  must  be 
cast off forever.

22 And the Holy Ghost giveth a au-
thority  that  I  should  speak  these 
things, and deny them not.

CHAPTER 11

Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and 
is shown in vision the tree of life—He 
sees the mother of the Son of God and 
learns of the condescension of God—He 
sees the baptism, ministry, and cruci-
fixion  of  the  Lamb  of  God—He  sees 
also the call and ministry of the Twelve  
Apostles  of  the  Lamb.  About  600 –
592 b.c.

For it came to pass after I had de-
sired  to  know  the  things  that  my 
father had seen, and believing that 
the  Lord  was  able  to  make  them 
known unto me, as I sat a pondering 
in mine heart I was b caught away in  
the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an 
exceedingly high c mountain, which 
I never had before seen, and upon 
which I never had before set my foot.
2 And the Spirit said unto me: Be-

hold, what a desirest thou?

3 And  I  said:  I  desire  to  behold 

the things which my father a saw.

4 And  the  Spirit  said  unto  me: 
a Believest thou that thy father saw 
the b tree of which he hath spoken?
5 And  I  said:  Yea,  thou  knowest 
that I a believe all the words of my 
father.

6 And  when  I  had  spoken  these 
words, the Spirit cried with a loud 
voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, 
the  most  high  God;  for  he  is  God 
over all the a earth, yea, even above 
all.  And  blessed  art  thou,  Nephi, 
because thou b believest in the Son 
of  the  most  high  God;  wherefore, 
thou shalt behold the things which 
thou hast desired.

7 And behold this thing shall be 
given unto thee for a a sign, that af-
ter thou hast beheld the tree which 
bore  the  fruit  which  thy  father 
tasted, thou shalt also behold a man 
descending out of heaven, and him 
shall ye witness; and after ye have 
witnessed him ye shall b bear record 
that it is the Son of God.

Spirit  said  unto  me:  Look!  And  I

looked and beheld a tree; and it was 
like unto the a tree which my father 
had seen; and the b beauty thereof 
was  far  beyond,  yea,  exceeding 
of  all  beauty;  and  the  c whiteness 
thereof  did  exceed  the  whiteness 
of the driven snow.

9 And it came to pass after I had 
seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: 
I behold thou hast shown unto me 
the tree which is a precious above all.
10 And  he  said  unto  me:  What  

desirest thou?

11 And I said unto him: To know 
the  a interpretation  thereof—for  I 
spake  unto  him  as  a  man  speak-
eth; for I beheld that he was in the 
b form of a man; yet nevertheless, I 
knew that it was the Spirit of the 
Lord;  and  he  spake  unto  me  as  a 
man speaketh with another.

12 And it came to pass that he said 
unto me: Look! And I looked as if to  
look upon him, and I saw him not; for  
he had gone from before my presence.
13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I 
looked and beheld the great city of  
Jerusalem, and also other cities. And 
I beheld the city of Nazareth; and 
in the city of a Nazareth I beheld a 
b virgin,  and  she  was  exceedingly 
fair and white.

14 And it came to pass that I saw 
the  a heavens  open;  and  an  angel 
came  down  and  stood  before  me; 
and he said unto me: Nephi, what 
beholdest thou?

15 And I said unto him: A virgin, 
most  beautiful  and  fair  above  all 
other virgins.

16 And he said unto me: Knowest 

thou the a condescension of God?

17 And  I  said  unto  him:  I  know 
that he loveth his children; never-
theless, I do not know the meaning 
of all things.

18 And he said unto me: Behold, 
the a virgin whom thou seest is the 
b mother of the Son of God, after the 
manner of the flesh.

19 And it came to pass that I be-
held that she was carried away in 
the Spirit; and after she had been 
carried away in the a Spirit for the 
space of a time the angel spake unto 
me, saying: Look!

20 And  I  looked  and  beheld  the 
virgin  again,  bearing  a  a child  in 
her arms.

21 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold the a Lamb of God, yea, even 
the  b Son  of  the  Eternal  c Father! 
Knowest thou the meaning of the 
d tree which thy father saw?

22 And  I  answered  him,  saying: 
Yea,  it  is  the  a love  of  God,  which 
b sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts 
of the children of men; wherefore, 
it is the  c most desirable above all  
things.

23 And he spake unto me, saying: 
Yea,  and  the  most  a joyous  to  the  
soul.

24 And  after  he  had  said  these 
words, he said unto me: Look! And I 
looked, and I beheld the Son of God 
a going forth among the children of 
men; and I saw many fall down at 
his feet and worship him.

25 And it came to pass that I beheld  
that  the  a rod  of  iron,  which  my 
father had seen, was the  b word of 
God, which c led to the fountain of 
d living waters, or to the e tree of life;

which waters are a representation 
of the love of God; and I also beheld 
that the tree of life was a represen-
tation of the love of God.

26 And  the  angel  said  unto  me 
again:  Look  and  behold  the  a con-
descension of God!

27 And I looked and  a beheld the 
Redeemer  of  the  world,  of  whom 
my  father  had  spoken;  and  I  also 
beheld  the  b prophet  who  should 
prepare the way before him. And 
the  Lamb  of  God  went  forth  and  
was  c baptized  of  him;  and  after  
he was baptized, I beheld the heav-
ens open, and the Holy Ghost come 
down out of heaven and abide upon 
him in the form of a d dove.

28 And  I  beheld  that  he  went 
forth ministering unto the people, 
in a power and great glory; and the 
multitudes were gathered together 
to hear him; and I beheld that they 
cast him out from among them.

29 And I also beheld a twelve oth-
ers following him. And it came to 
pass that they were b carried away 
in the Spirit from before my face, 
and I saw them not.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel spake unto me again, saying: 
Look! And I looked, and I beheld 
the heavens open again, and I saw 
a angels descending upon the chil-
dren of men; and they did minister 
unto them.

31 And he spake unto me again, 
saying: Look! And I looked, and I 
beheld the Lamb of God going forth 
among the children of men. And I 
beheld  multitudes  of  people  who 

were a sick, and who were afflicted 
with  all  manner  of  diseases,  and 
with  b devils  and  c unclean  spirits; 
and  the  angel  spake  and  showed 
all these things unto me. And they 
were  d healed by the power of the 
Lamb  of  God;  and  the  devils  and 
the unclean spirits were cast out.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel spake unto me again, saying: 
Look! And I looked and beheld the 
Lamb  of  God,  that  he  was  a taken 
by the people; yea, the Son of the 
everlasting God was b judged of the 
world; and I saw and bear record.

33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was 
a lifted up upon the cross and b slain 
for the sins of the world.

34 And after he was slain I saw the 
multitudes of the earth, that they 
were  gathered  together  to  a fight 
against  the  apostles  of  the  Lamb; 
for thus were the twelve called by 
the angel of the Lord.

35 And the multitude of the earth 
was  gathered  together;  and  I  be-
held that they were in a large and 
spacious  a building,  like  unto  the 
building which my father saw. And 
the  angel  of  the  Lord  spake  unto 
me again, saying: Behold the world 
and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold 
the house of Israel hath gathered 
together to b fight against the twelve 
apostles of the Lamb.

36 And it came to pass that I saw 
and bear record, that the great and 
spacious building was the a pride of 
the world; and it b fell, and the fall 
thereof was exceedingly great. And

again, saying: Thus shall be the de-
struction of all nations, kindreds, 
tongues,  and  people,  that  shall 
fight  against  the  twelve  apostles 
of the Lamb.

CHAPTER 12
Nephi sees in vision the land of promise; 
the righteousness, iniquity, and down-
fall  of  its  inhabitants;  the  coming  of 
the Lamb of God among them; how the 
Twelve Disciples and the Twelve Apos-
tles will judge Israel; and the loathsome 
and filthy state of those who dwindle 
in unbelief. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that the angel 
said  unto  me:  Look,  and  behold 
thy seed, and also the seed of thy 
brethren. And I looked and beheld 
the a land of promise; and I beheld 
multitudes of people, yea, even as 
it were in number as many as the 
b sand of the sea.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld 
multitudes  gathered  together  to 
battle, one against the other; and I 
beheld a wars, and rumors of wars, 
and great slaughters with the sword 
among my people.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  be-
held many generations pass away, 
after the manner of wars and con-
tentions in the land; and I beheld 
many cities, yea, even that I did not 
number them.

4 And it came to pass that I saw 
a  a mist  of  b darkness  on  the  face 
of the land of promise; and I saw 
lightnings, and I heard thunderings, 
and earthquakes, and all manner of 
tumultuous  noises;  and  I  saw  the 
earth and the rocks, that they rent; 
and I saw mountains tumbling into 

pieces; and I saw the plains of the 
earth,  that  they  were  c broken  up; 
and I saw many cities that they were 
d sunk;  and  I  saw  many  that  they 
were  burned  with  fire;  and  I  saw 
many that did tumble to the earth, 
because of the quaking thereof.

5 And it came to pass after I saw 
these  things,  I  saw  the  a vapor  of 
darkness,  that  it  passed  from  off 
the face of the earth; and behold, I 
saw multitudes who had not fallen 
because  of  the  great  and  terrible 
judgments of the Lord.

6 And I saw the heavens open, and 
the  a Lamb of God descending out 
of heaven; and he came down and 
b showed himself unto them.

7 And I also saw and bear record 
that the Holy Ghost fell upon a twelve 
others; and they were ordained of 
God, and chosen.

8 And  the  angel  spake  unto  me, 
saying:  Behold  the  twelve  disci-
ples of the Lamb, who are chosen 
to minister unto thy seed.

9 And  he  said  unto  me:  Thou  
rememberest  the  a twelve  apostles 
of the Lamb? Behold they are they 
who shall b judge the twelve tribes 
of  Israel;  wherefore,  the  twelve  
ministers of thy seed shall be judged 
of them; for ye are of the house of  
Israel.

10 And  these  a twelve  ministers 
whom thou beholdest shall judge 
thy  seed.  And,  behold,  they  are 
righteous  forever;  for  because  of 
their faith in the Lamb of God their 
b garments  are  made  white  in  his  
blood.

righteousness; and their garments 
were white even like unto the Lamb 
of God. And the angel said unto me: 
These are made white in the blood 
of the Lamb, because of their faith 
in him.

12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of 
the a fourth generation who passed 
away in righteousness.

13 And it came to pass that I saw 
the  multitudes  of  the  earth  gath-
ered together.

14 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold thy seed, and also the seed 
of thy brethren.

15 And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld the people of my seed 
gathered  together  in  multitudes 
a against the seed of my brethren; 
and  they  were  gathered  together 
to battle.

16 And the angel spake unto me, 
saying:  Behold  the  fountain  of 
a filthy water which thy father saw; 
yea,  even  the  b river  of  which  he 
spake; and the depths thereof are 
the depths of c hell.

17 And the a mists of darkness are 
the temptations of the devil, which 
b blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth 
the hearts of the children of men, 
and leadeth them away into c broad 
roads, that they perish and are lost.
18 And  the  large  and  spacious 
a building, which thy father saw, is 
vain b imaginations and the c pride 
of the children of men. And a great 
and a terrible d gulf divideth them; 
yea, even the word of the e justice of 
the Eternal God, and the Messiah 
who is the Lamb of God, of whom 
the  Holy  Ghost  beareth  record, 
from  the  beginning  of  the  world 

until this time, and from this time 
henceforth and forever.

19 And  while  the  angel  spake 
these words, I beheld and saw that 
the seed of my brethren did con-
tend against my seed, according to 
the word of the angel; and because 
of  the  pride  of  my  seed,  and  the 
a temptations of the devil, I beheld 
that  the  seed  of  my  brethren  did 
b overpower the people of my seed.
20 And it came to pass that I be-
held,  and  saw  the  people  of  the 
seed of my brethren that they had 
overcome my seed; and they went 
forth in multitudes upon the face 
of the land.

21 And  I  saw  them  gathered  to-
gether in multitudes; and I saw a wars 
and rumors of wars among them; 
and in wars and rumors of wars I 
saw b many generations pass away.
22 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold  these  shall  a dwindle  in 
unbelief.

23 And it came to pass that I be-
held,  after  they  had  dwindled  in 
unbelief they became a a dark, and 
loathsome,  and  a  b filthy  people, 
full of c idleness and all manner of 
abominations.

of  gentile  apostasy,  the  restoration  of

And it came to pass that the angel 
spake unto me, saying: Look! And 
I looked and beheld many nations 
and kingdoms.

2 And the angel said unto me: What 
beholdest thou? And I said: I behold 
many a nations and kingdoms.

3 And he said unto me: These are 
the  nations  and  kingdoms  of  the 
Gentiles.

4 And it came to pass that I saw 
among the nations of the a Gentiles 
the formation of a b great church.

5 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold the formation of a a church 
which  is  most  abominable  above 
all other churches, which b slayeth  
the saints of God, yea, and tortureth  
them and bindeth them down, and  
yoketh them with a c yoke of iron, and  
bringeth them down into captivity.
6 And it came to pass that I beheld 
this a great and b abominable church; 
and I saw the c devil that he was the 
founder of it.

7 And I also saw a gold, and silver, 
and  silks,  and  scarlets,  and  fine-
twined  b linen,  and  all  manner  of 
precious clothing; and I saw many 
harlots.

8 And  the  angel  spake  unto  me, 
saying:  Behold  the  gold,  and  the  
silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, 
and the fine-twined linen, and the 
precious clothing, and the harlots, 
are  the  a desires  of  this  great  and 
abominable church.

9 And also for the  a praise of the 
world  do  they  b destroy  the  saints 
of God, and bring them down into 
captivity.

10 And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld many waters; and they 

divided the Gentiles from the seed 
of my brethren.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel  said  unto  me:  Behold  the 
wrath of God is upon the seed of 
thy brethren.

12 And I looked and beheld a man 
among the Gentiles, who was sepa-
rated from the seed of my brethren 
by the many waters; and I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it came down 
and a wrought upon the man; and he 
went forth upon the many waters, 
even unto the seed of my brethren, 
who were in the promised land.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it wrought 
upon other Gentiles; and they went 
forth  out  of  captivity,  upon  the 
many waters.

14 And it came to pass that I beheld 
many  a multitudes  of  the  Gentiles 
upon  the  b land  of  promise;  and  I 
beheld  the  wrath  of  God,  that  it 
was upon the seed of my brethren; 
and they were c scattered before the 
Gentiles and were smitten.

15 And I beheld the Spirit of the 
Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, 
and they did prosper and  a obtain 
the b land for their inheritance; and 
I beheld that they were white, and 
exceedingly  fair  and  c beautiful, 
like  unto  my  people  before  they 
were d slain.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  beheld  that  the  Gentiles 
who had gone forth out of captiv-
ity did humble themselves before 
the Lord; and the power of the Lord 
was a with them.

upon the waters, and upon the land 
also, to battle against them.

18 And  I  beheld  that  the  power 
of  God  was  with  them,  and  also 
that the wrath of God was upon all 
those that were gathered together 
a against them to battle.

19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the

it was carried forth among them.

21 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Knowest thou the meaning of the 
book?

22 And I said unto him: I know not.
23 And  he  said:  Behold  it  pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. 
And  I,  Nephi,  beheld  it;  and  he 
said unto me: The a book that thou 
beholdest is a b record of the c Jews, 
which  contains  the  covenants  of 
the Lord, which he hath made unto 
the house of Israel; and it also con-
taineth many of the prophecies of 
the holy prophets; and it is a record 
like unto the engravings which are 
upon the d plates of brass, save there 
are not so many; nevertheless, they 
contain the covenants of the Lord, 
which he hath made unto the house 
of Israel; wherefore, they are of great 
worth unto the Gentiles.

24 And the angel of the Lord said 
unto me: Thou hast beheld that the 
a book  proceeded  forth  from  the 
mouth of a Jew; and when it pro-
ceeded forth from the mouth of a   Jew 
it contained the fulness of the gospel  

of  the  Lord,  of  whom  the  twelve 
apostles bear record; and they bear 
record according to the truth which 
is in the Lamb of God.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth 
from the a Jews in purity unto the 
b Gentiles,  according  to  the  truth 
which is in God.

26 And after they go forth by the 
a hand  of  the  twelve  apostles  of  
the Lamb, from the Jews b unto the 
Gentiles, thou seest the formation of 
that c great and abominable d church, 
which  is  most  abominable  above 
all other churches; for behold, they 
have e taken away from the gospel 
of the Lamb many parts which are 
f plain and most precious; and also 
many covenants of the Lord have 
they taken away.

27 And all this have they done that 
they might pervert the right ways 
of the Lord, that they might blind 
the eyes and harden the hearts of 
the children of men.

28 Wherefore, thou seest that after 
the book hath gone forth through 
the hands of the great and abomi-
nable church, that there are many 
plain  and  a precious  things  taken 
away from the book, which is the 
book of the Lamb of God.

29 And after these plain and pre-
cious  things  were  a taken  away  it 
goeth forth unto all the nations of 
the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth 
unto all the nations of the Gentiles, 
yea, even across the many waters 
which thou hast seen with the Gen-
tiles which have gone forth out of 
captivity,  thou  seest—because  of 
the many plain and precious things 
which have been taken out of the

book, which were plain unto the un-
derstanding of the children of men, 
according  to  the  plainness  which 
is in the Lamb of God—because of 
these things which are taken away 
out of the gospel of the Lamb, an 
exceedingly great many do stum-
ble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath 
great power over them.

30 Nevertheless,  thou  beholdest 
that  the  Gentiles  who  have  gone 
forth out of captivity, and have been 
lifted up by the power of God above 
all other nations, upon the face of 
the land which is choice above all 
other lands, which is the land that 
the Lord God hath covenanted with 
thy father that his seed should have 
for  the  a land  of  their  inheritance; 
wherefore, thou seest that the Lord 
God will not suffer that the Gentiles 
will  utterly  destroy  the  b mixture 
of thy c seed, which are among thy 
brethren.

31 Neither will he suffer that the 
Gentiles shall a destroy the seed of 
thy brethren.

32 Neither will the Lord God suf-
fer that the Gentiles shall forever 
remain in that awful state of blind-
ness, which thou beholdest they are 
in, because of the plain and most 
precious parts of the gospel of the 
Lamb which have been kept back 
by that a abominable church, whose 
formation thou hast seen.

33 Wherefore  saith  the  Lamb  of 
God:  I  will  be  a merciful  unto  the 
Gentiles,  unto  the  visiting  of  the 
remnant of the house of Israel in 
great judgment.

34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel of the Lord spake unto me, 
saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of 
God, after I have a visited the b rem-
nant  of  the  house  of  Israel—and 
this remnant of whom I speak is the 
seed of thy father—wherefore, after 
I  have  visited  them  in  judgment, 
and smitten them by the hand of 
the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles 
do  c stumble  exceedingly,  because 
of  the  most  plain  and  precious 
parts  of  the  d gospel  of  the  Lamb 
which have been kept back by that 
abominable  church,  which  is  the  
mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I 
will be merciful unto the e Gentiles 
in  that  day,  insomuch  that  I  will 
f  bring forth unto them, in mine own 
power, much of my g gospel, which 
shall be plain and precious, saith  
the Lamb.

35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I 
will manifest myself unto thy seed, 
that they shall write many things 
which I shall minister unto them, 
which shall be plain and precious; 
and  after  thy  seed  shall  be  de-
stroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, 
and also the seed of thy brethren, 
behold,  a these things shall be hid 
up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, 
by the gift and power of the Lamb.
36 And in them shall be written 
my a gospel, saith the Lamb, and my 
b rock and my salvation.

37 And a blessed are they who shall 
seek to bring forth my b Zion at that 
day, for they shall have the c gift and 
the d power of the Holy Ghost; and

shall be  f  lifted up at the last day, 
and shall be saved in the everlasting 
g kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso 
shall h publish peace, yea, tidings of 
great joy, how beautiful upon the 
mountains shall they be.

38 And it came to pass that I be-
held the remnant of the seed of my 
brethren, and also the a book of the 
Lamb of God, which had proceeded 
forth  from  the  mouth  of  the  Jew, 
that it came forth from the Gentiles 
b unto  the  remnant  of  the  seed  of 
my brethren.

39 And  after  it  had  come  forth 
unto them I beheld a other b books, 
which came forth by the power of 
the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto 
them, unto the c convincing of the 
Gentiles and the remnant of the seed 
of my brethren, and also the Jews 
who  were  scattered  upon  all  the 
face of the earth, that the records 
of the prophets and of the twelve 
apostles of the Lamb are d true.

40 And the angel spake unto me, 
saying: These  a last records, which 
thou hast seen among the Gentiles, 
shall b establish the truth of the c first, 
which are of the d twelve apostles of 
the Lamb, and shall make known 
the plain and precious things which 
have been taken away from them; 
and shall make known to all kin-
dreds,  tongues,  and  people,  that 
the Lamb of God is the Son of the 
Eternal Father, and the  e Savior of 
the world; and that all men must 
come unto him, or they cannot be  
saved.

41 And they must come according 
to the words which shall be estab-
lished by the mouth of the Lamb; 
and the words of the Lamb shall be 
made known in the records of thy 
seed, as well as in the a records of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb; where-
fore they both shall be established 
in  b one; for there is  c one God and 
one d Shepherd over all the earth.

42 And the time cometh that he 
shall manifest himself unto all na-
tions, both unto the a Jews and also 
unto the Gentiles; and after he has 
manifested himself unto the Jews 
and  also  unto  the  Gentiles,  then 
he shall manifest himself unto the 
Gentiles  and  also  unto  the  Jews, 
and the b last shall be first, and the 
c first shall be last.

CHAPTER 14

An angel tells Nephi of the blessings and 
cursings to fall upon the Gentiles—There 
are only two churches: the Church of 
the Lamb of God and the church of the 
devil—The Saints of God in all nations 
are persecuted by the great and abomi-
nable church—The Apostle John will 
write concerning the end of the world. 
About 600–592 b.c.
And  it  shall  come  to  pass,  that  if 
the  a Gentiles  shall  hearken  unto 
the Lamb of God in that day that 
he shall manifest himself unto them 
in word, and also in b power, in very 
deed, unto the c taking away of their 
d stumbling blocks—

against the Lamb of God, they shall 
be numbered among the seed of thy 
father; yea, they shall be a numbered 
among the house of Israel; and they 
shall be a b blessed people upon the 
c promised land forever; they shall 
be no more brought down into cap-
tivity; and the house of Israel shall 
no more be confounded.

3 And that great a pit, which hath 
been digged for them by that great 
and  abominable  church,  which 
was founded by the devil and his  
children, that he might lead away 
the  souls  of  men  down  to  hell—
yea, that great pit which hath been 
digged for the destruction of men 
shall be filled by those who digged 
it,  unto  their  utter  destruction, 
saith the Lamb of God; not the de-
struction of the soul, save it be the  
casting of it into that  b hell which 
hath no end.

4 For behold, this is according to 
the a captivity of the devil, and also 
according to the justice of God, upon 
all those who will work wickedness 
and abomination before him.

5 And it came to pass that the an-
gel spake unto me, Nephi, saying: 
Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles 
repent it shall be a well with them; 
and thou also knowest concerning 
the covenants of the Lord unto the 
house of Israel; and thou also hast 
heard  that  whoso  b repenteth  not 
must perish.

6 Therefore,  a wo  be  unto  the  
Gentiles if it so be that they harden 

their  hearts  against  the  Lamb  of  
God.

7 For the time cometh, saith the 
Lamb  of  God,  that  I  will  work  a 
great and a a marvelous work among 
the children of men; a b work which 
shall be everlasting, either on the 
one  hand  or  on  the  other—either 
to  the  convincing  of  them  unto 
c peace and d life eternal, or unto the 
deliverance of them to the hardness 
of their hearts and the blindness of 
their minds unto their being brought 
down into captivity, and also into 
destruction,  both  temporally  and 
spiritually,  according  to  the  e cap-
tivity of the devil, of which I have 
spoken.

8 And it came to pass that when 
the angel had spoken these words, 
he said unto me: Rememberest thou  
the a covenants of the Father unto the  
house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.
9 And it came to pass that he said 
unto me: Look, and behold that great 
and abominable church, which is 
the mother of abominations, whose 
founder is the a devil.

10 And he said unto me: Behold 
there are save a two churches only; 
the one is the church of the Lamb 
of God, and the b other is the church 
of  the  c devil;  wherefore,  d whoso 
belongeth not to the church of the 
Lamb  of  God  belongeth  to  that 
great church, which is the mother 
of  abominations;  and  she  is  the 
e whore of all the earth.

1 NEPHI 14  : 12–23

looked and beheld the whore of all 
the earth, and she sat upon many 
a waters; and she had dominion over 
b all  the  earth,  among  all  nations, 
kindreds, tongues, and people.

12 And it came to pass that I beheld 
the church of the Lamb of God, and 
its numbers were a few, because of 
the wickedness and abominations  
of the whore who sat upon many 
waters; nevertheless, I beheld that 
the church of the Lamb, who were 
the saints of God, were also upon 
b all the face of the earth; and their  
dominions upon the face of the earth  
were small, because of the wicked-
ness of the great whore whom I saw.
13 And it came to pass that I beheld  
that the great mother of abomina-
tions did gather together multitudes 
upon the face of all the earth, among 
all  the  nations  of  the  Gentiles,  to 
a fight against the Lamb of God.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  beheld  the  power  of  the 
Lamb of God, that it descended upon 
the saints of the church of the Lamb, 
and  upon  the  covenant  people  of 
the Lord, who were scattered upon 
all the face of the earth; and they 
were  a armed  with  b righteousness 
and with the c power of God in great  
glory.

15 And it came to pass that I beheld 
that the wrath of God was a poured 
out upon that great and abominable 
church, insomuch that there were 
wars  and  rumors  of  wars  among 
all  the  b nations  and  kindreds  of 
the earth.

16 And as there began to be a wars 
and rumors of wars among all the 

nations  which  belonged  to  the 
mother of abominations, the angel 
spake unto me, saying: Behold, the 
wrath of God is upon the mother 
of harlots; and behold, thou seest 
all these things—

17 And  when  the  a day  cometh 
that  the  b wrath  of  God  is  poured 
out  upon  the  mother  of  harlots, 
which  is  the  great  and  abomina-
ble church of all the earth, whose 
founder is the devil, then, at that 
day, the  c work of the Father shall 
commence,  in  preparing  the  way 
for the fulfilling of his d covenants, 
which he hath made to his people 
who are of the house of Israel.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
19 And I looked and beheld a man, 
and he was dressed in a white robe.
20 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold a one of the twelve apostles 
of the Lamb.

21 Behold, he shall a see and b write 
the c remainder of these things; yea, 
and also many things which have 
been.

22 And  he  shall  also  write  con-

cerning the end of the world.

23 Wherefore,  the  things  which 
he  shall  write  are  just  and  true; 
and behold they are written in the 
a book which thou beheld proceed-
ing  out  of  the  mouth  of  the  Jew; 
and at the time they proceeded out 
of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the 
time the book proceeded out of the 
mouth of the Jew, the things which 
were written were plain and pure, 
and most b precious and easy to the 
understanding of all men.

are  many  things  which  thou  hast 
seen;  and  behold,  the  remainder 
shalt thou see.

25 But the things which thou shalt 
see hereafter thou shalt not write; 
for the Lord God hath ordained the 
apostle of the Lamb of God that he 
should a write them.

26 And also others who have been, 
to them hath he shown all things, 
and they have a written them; and 
they are b sealed up to come forth in  
their purity, according to the truth 
which is in the Lamb, in the own 
due time of the Lord, unto the house 
of Israel.

27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear 
record, that the name of the apostle 
of the Lamb was a John, according 
to the word of the angel.

28 And behold, I, Nephi, am for-
bidden that I should write the re-
mainder of the things which I saw 
and  heard;  wherefore  the  things 
which I have written sufficeth me; 
and I have written but a small part 
of the things which I saw.

29 And  I  bear  record  that  I  saw 
the  things  which  my  a father  saw, 
and the angel of the Lord did make 
them known unto me.

30 And  now  I  make  an  end  of 
speaking  concerning  the  things 
which  I  saw  while  I  was  a carried 
away  in  the  Spirit;  and  if  all  the 
things which I saw are not written, 
the things which I have written are 
b true. And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 15

Lehi’s seed are to receive the gospel from  
the  Gentiles  in  the  latter  days—The 
gathering of Israel is likened unto an 

olive tree whose natural branches will be 
grafted in again—Nephi interprets the 
vision of the tree of life and speaks of 
the justice of God in dividing the wicked 
from the righteous. About 600–592 b.c.

And  it  came  to  pass  that  after  I, 
Nephi,  had  been  carried  away  in 
the Spirit, and seen all these things, 
I returned to the tent of my father.
2 And it came to pass that I beheld 
my brethren, and they were disput-
ing  one  with  another  concerning 
the  things  which  my  father  had 
spoken unto them.

3 For he truly spake many great 
things unto them, which were hard 
to be a understood, save a man should 
inquire of the Lord; and they be-
ing hard in their hearts, therefore 
they did not look unto the Lord as 
they ought.

4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts,  and  also,  because  of  the 
things which I had seen, and knew 
they  must  unavoidably  come  to  
pass because of the great wicked-
ness of the children of men.

5 And it came to pass that I was 
overcome because of my afflictions, 
for I considered that mine a afflic-
tions were great above all, because 
of  the  b destruction  of  my  people, 
for I had beheld their fall.

6 And it came to pass that after I 
had received a strength I spake unto 
my brethren, desiring to know of 
them the cause of their disputations.
7 And they said: Behold, we cannot 
understand  the  words  which  our 
father hath spoken concerning the 
natural branches of the a olive tree, 
and also concerning the Gentiles.

8 And I said unto them: Have ye 

a inquired of the Lord?

1 NEPHI 15  : 9–18

9 And they said unto me: a We have 
not; for the Lord maketh no such 
thing known unto us.

10 Behold, I said unto them: How 
is it that ye do not keep the com-
mandments of the Lord? How is it 
that ye will a perish, because of the 
hardness of your hearts?

11 Do ye not remember the things 
which  the  Lord  hath  said?—If  ye 
will  not  harden  your  hearts,  and 
a ask  me  in  b faith,  believing  that 
ye shall receive, with diligence in 
keeping my commandments, surely 
these things shall be made known 
unto you.

12 Behold, I say unto you, that the 
house of Israel was compared unto 
an  olive  tree,  by  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord which was in our father; and 
behold are we not broken off from 
the house of Israel, and are we not 
a a branch of the house of Israel?

13 And now, the thing which our 
father  meaneth  concerning  the 
grafting in of the natural branches 
through the fulness of the Gentiles, 
is, that in the latter days, when our 
seed  shall  have  a dwindled  in  un-
belief, yea, for the space of many 
years, and many generations after 
the  b Messiah  shall  be  manifested 
in body unto the children of men, 
then shall the fulness of the c gospel 
of the Messiah come unto the Gen-
tiles, and from the  d Gentiles unto 
the remnant of our seed—

14 And at that day shall the rem-
nant of our a seed b know that they 
are of the house of Israel, and that 
they are the c covenant people of the 
Lord; and then shall they know and  

d come  to  the  e knowledge  of  their 
forefathers, and also to the knowl-
edge of the gospel of their Redeemer, 
which  was  ministered  unto  their 
fathers by him; wherefore, they shall 
come to the knowledge of their Re-
deemer and the very points of his 
doctrine, that they may know how 
to come unto him and be saved.

15 And then at that day will they 
not  rejoice  and  give  praise  unto 
their  everlasting  God,  their  a rock 
and their salvation? Yea, at that day, 
will they not receive the strength 
and  nourishment  from  the  true 
b vine? Yea, will they not come unto 
the true fold of God?

16 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Yea; 
they  shall  be  remembered  again 
among  the  house  of  Israel;  they 
shall be a grafted in, being a natu-
ral  branch  of  the  olive  tree,  into 
the true olive tree.

17 And  this  is  what  our  father 
meaneth;  and  he  meaneth  that  it 
will  not  come  to  pass  until  after 
they are scattered by the Gentiles; 
and he meaneth that it shall come 
by  way  of  the  Gentiles,  that  the 
Lord may show his power unto the 
Gentiles, for the very cause that he 
shall be a rejected of the Jews, or of 
the house of Israel.

18 Wherefore, our father hath not 
spoken of our seed alone, but also 
of all the house of Israel, pointing 
to  the  covenant  which  should  be 
fulfilled in the latter days; which 
covenant  the  Lord  made  to  our 
father Abraham, saying: In thy a seed 
shall all the kindreds of the earth  
be b blessed.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, spake much unto them con-
cerning these things; yea, I spake 
unto them concerning the a restora-
tion of the Jews in the latter days.
20 And I did rehearse unto them 
the  words  of  a Isaiah,  who  spake 
b concerning the c restoration of the  
Jews, or of the house of Israel; and 
after they were restored they should 
no  more  be  confounded,  neither 
should  they  be  scattered  again. 
And it came to pass that I did speak 
many words unto my brethren, that 
they were pacified and did d humble 
themselves before the Lord.

21 And it came to pass that they 
did  speak  unto  me  again,  saying: 
What  meaneth  this  thing  which 
our father saw in a dream? What 
meaneth the a tree which he saw?

22 And I said unto them: It was a 

representation of the a tree of life.

23 And they said unto me: What 
meaneth  the  a rod  of  iron  which 
our father saw, that led to the tree?
24 And  I  said  unto  them  that  it 
was the  a word of God; and whoso 
would  hearken  unto  the  word  of 
God, and would b hold fast unto it, 
they  would  never  perish;  neither 
could  the  c temptations  and  the  
fiery d darts of the e adversary over-
power them unto blindness, to lead 
them away to destruction.

25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort 
them to give a heed unto the word 
of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them 
with all the energies of my soul, and 
with all the  b faculty which I pos-
sessed, that they would give heed 
to the word of God and remember 

to keep his commandments always 
in all things.

26 And they said unto me: What 
meaneth the a river of water which 
our father saw?

27 And I said unto them that the 
a water  which  my  father  saw  was 
b filthiness;  and  so  much  was  his 
mind swallowed up in other things 
that he beheld not the filthiness of 
the water.

28 And I said unto them that it was 
an awful a gulf, which separated the 
wicked  from  the  tree  of  life,  and 
also from the saints of God.

29 And  I  said  unto  them  that  it 
was a representation of that awful 
a hell, which the angel said unto me 
was prepared for the wicked.

30 And  I  said  unto  them  that  
our father also saw that the a justice 
of God did also divide the wicked 
from the righteous; and the bright-
ness  thereof  was  like  unto  the 
brightness of a flaming b fire, which 
ascendeth up unto God forever and 
ever, and hath no end.

31 And they said unto me: Doth 
this thing mean the torment of the 
body in the days of a probation, or 
doth it mean the final state of the 
soul after the b death of the temporal 
body, or doth it speak of the things 
which are temporal?

32 And it came to pass that I said 
unto them that it was a represen-
tation of things both temporal and 
spiritual; for the day should come 
that they must be judged of their 
a works, yea, even the works which 
were done by the temporal body in 
their days of b probation.

1 NEPHI 15  : 33–16  : 6

33 Wherefore, if they should a die 
in their wickedness they must be 
b cast off also, as to the things which 
are spiritual, which are pertaining 
to  righteousness;  wherefore,  they 
must  be  brought  to  stand  before 
God, to be c judged of their d works; 
and if their works have been filthi-
ness they must needs be e filthy; and 
if they be filthy it must needs be 
that they cannot f dwell in the king-
dom of God; if so, the kingdom of 
God must be filthy also.

34 But behold, I say unto you, the 
kingdom of God is not filthy, and 
there  cannot  any  unclean  thing 
enter  into  the  kingdom  of  God; 
wherefore  there  must  needs  be  a 
place  of  a filthiness  prepared  for 
that which is filthy.

35 And there is a place prepared, 
yea, even that a awful b hell of which 
I have spoken, and the c devil is the 
preparator of it; wherefore the fi-
nal state of the souls of men is to 
dwell in the kingdom of God, or to 
be cast out because of that d justice 
of which I have spoken.

36 Wherefore, the wicked are re-
jected from the righteous, and also 
from that a tree of life, whose fruit is 
most precious and most b desirable 
above all other fruits; yea, and it is 
the c greatest of all the d gifts of God. 
And thus I spake unto my brethren.  
Amen.

CHAPTER 16

The wicked take the truth to be hard—
Lehi’s  sons  marry  the  daughters  of  

Ishmael—The  Liahona  guides  their 
course  in  the  wilderness—Messages 
from the Lord are written on the Lia-
hona from time to time—Ishmael dies; 
his family murmurs because of afflic-
tions. About 600–592 b.c.

And now it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had made an end of speaking 
to  my  brethren,  behold  they  said 
unto me: Thou hast declared unto 
us hard things, more than we are 
able to bear.

2 And it came to pass that I said 
unto them that I knew that I had 
spoken  a hard  things  against  the 
wicked,  according  to  the  truth; 
and the righteous have I justified, 
and  testified  that  they  should  be 
lifted  up  at  the  last  day;  where-
fore,  the  b guilty  taketh  the  c truth 
to be hard, for it d cutteth them to 
the very center.

3 And  now  my  brethren,  if  ye 
were righteous and were willing to  
hearken to the truth, and give heed 
unto  it,  that  ye  might  a walk  up-
rightly before God, then ye would 
not murmur because of the truth, 
and say: Thou speakest hard things  
against us.

4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  exhort  my  brethren,  with  all 
dil i gence,  to  keep  the  command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did a humble themselves before the 
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and 
great hopes of them, that they would 
walk in the paths of righteousness.

and done as my father dwelt in a 
tent in the a valley which he called 
Lemuel.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, took one of the a daughters of  
Ishmael  to  b wife;  and  also,  my 
brethren took of the c daughters of 
Ishmael  to  wife;  and  also  d Zoram 
took the eldest daughter of Ishmael  
to wife.

8 And thus my father had fulfilled 
all the a commandments of the Lord 
which  had  been  given  unto  him. 
And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed 
of the Lord exceedingly.

9 And it came to pass that the voice 
of the Lord spake unto my father 
by night, and commanded him that 
on the morrow he should take his 
a journey into the wilderness.

10 And it came to pass that as my 
father  arose  in  the  morning,  and 
went forth to the tent door, to his 
great astonishment he beheld upon 
the ground a round a ball of curious 
workmanship;  and  it  was  of  fine 
brass. And within the ball were two 
spindles; and the one b pointed the 
way whither we should go into the 
wilderness.

11 And it came to pass that we did 
gather together whatsoever things 
we should carry into the wilderness, 
and all the remainder of our pro-
visions which the Lord had given 
unto us; and we did take  a seed of 
every kind that we might carry into 
the wilderness.

12 And it came to pass that we did 
take our tents and depart into the 
wilderness, across the river Laman.
13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
traveled for the space of four days, 
nearly a south-southeast direction, 
and we did pitch our tents again; and 
we did call the name of the place  
a Shazer.

14 And it came to pass that we did 
take our bows and our arrows, and 
go forth into the wilderness to slay 
food for our families; and after we 
had slain food for our families we 
did  return  again  to  our  families 
in  the  wilderness,  to  the  place  of 
Shazer. And we did go forth again  
in  the  wilderness,  following  the 
same  direction,  keeping  in  the 
most fertile parts of the wilderness, 
which were in the borders near the 
a Red Sea.

15 And it came to pass that we did 
travel for the space of many days, 
a slaying food by the way, with our 
bows and our arrows and our stones 
and our slings.

16 And we did follow the a direc-
tions of the ball, which led us in the 
more fertile parts of the wilderness.
17 And after we had traveled for 
the space of many days, we did pitch 
our  tents  for  the  space  of  a  time, 
that we might again rest ourselves 
and obtain food for our families.

18 And it came to pass that as I, 
Nephi, went forth to slay food, be-
hold,  I  did  break  my  bow,  which 
was made of fine  a steel; and after 
I  did  break  my  bow,  behold,  my 
brethren were angry with me be-
cause of the loss of my bow, for we 
did obtain no food.

19 And it came to pass that we did 
return without food to our families, 
and being much fatigued, because 
of their journeying, they did suffer 
much for the want of food.

20 And it came to pass that Laman 
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael 
did begin to murmur exceedingly,  
because  of  their  sufferings  and 
afflictions  in  the  wilderness;  and 
also  my  father  began  to  murmur 
against the Lord his God; yea, and 
they were all exceedingly sorrowful,

Nephi, having been afflicted with 
my brethren because of the loss of 
my bow, and their bows having lost 
their a springs, it began to be exceed-
ingly difficult, yea, insomuch that 
we could obtain no food.

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  speak  much  unto  my  breth-
ren,  because  they  had  hardened  
their hearts again, even unto a com-
plaining against the Lord their God.
23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  did  a make  out  of  wood  a 
bow, and out of a straight stick, an 
arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself 
with  a  bow  and  an  arrow,  with  a 
sling  and  with  stones.  And  I  said 
unto my b father: Whither shall I go  
to obtain food?

24 And it came to pass that he did 
a inquire of the Lord, for they had 
b humbled  themselves  because  of 
my words; for I did say many things 
unto them in the energy of my soul.
25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  Lord  came  unto  my 
father; and he was truly a chastened 
because of his murmuring against 
the  Lord,  insomuch  that  he  was 
brought  down  into  the  depths  of 
sorrow.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Look upon the ball, and behold the 
things which are written.

27 And it came to pass that when 
my father beheld the things which 
were a written upon the ball, he did 
fear and tremble exceedingly, and 
also my brethren and the sons of 
Ishmael and our wives.

28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,  
beheld the pointers which were in 
the ball, that they did work accord-
ing to the a faith and diligence and 
heed which we did give unto them.
29 And  there  was  also  written 
upon  them  a  new  writing,  which 
was plain to be read, which did give 
us a understanding concerning the 
ways of the Lord; and it was writ-
ten and changed from time to time, 
according to the faith and diligence 
which we gave unto it. And thus we 
see that by b small means the Lord 
can bring about great things.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did go forth up into the top 
of the mountain, according to the 
a directions which were given upon 
the ball.

31 And it came to pass that I did 
slay wild  a beasts, insomuch that I 
did obtain food for our families.

32 And it came to pass that I did 
return  to  our  tents,  bearing  the 
beasts which I had slain; and now 
when  they  beheld  that  I  had  ob-
tained  a food, how great was their 
joy! And it came to pass that they 
did humble themselves before the 
Lord, and did give thanks unto him.
33 And it came to pass that we did 
again  take  our  journey,  traveling 
nearly  the  same  course  as  in  the 
beginning; and after we had trav-
eled for the space of many days we 
did pitch our tents again, that we 
might tarry for the space of a time.
34 And it came to pass that a Ish-
mael died, and was buried in the 
place which was called b Nahom.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
daughters  of  Ishmael  did  a mourn 
exceedingly, because of the loss of

their  father,  and  because  of  their 
b afflictions in the wilderness; and 
they did c murmur against my father, 
because he had brought them out of 
the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our  
father is dead; yea, and we have wan-
dered much in the wilderness, and 
we have suffered much affliction,  
hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after 
all these sufferings we must perish 
in the wilderness with hunger.

36 And  thus  they  did  murmur 
against my father, and also against 
me; and they were desirous to a re-
turn again to Jerusalem.

37 And Laman said unto Lemuel 
and also unto the sons of Ishmael: 
Behold, let us a slay our father, and 
also  our  brother  Nephi,  who  has 
taken it upon him to be our b ruler 
and our teacher, who are his elder 
brethren.

38 Now, he says that the Lord has 
talked with him, and also that a an-
gels have ministered unto him. But 
behold, we know that he lies unto 
us; and he tells us these things, and 
he  worketh  many  things  by  his 
cunning arts, that he may deceive 
our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he 
may lead us away into some strange 
wilderness;  and  after  he  has  led 
us  away,  he  has  thought  to  make 
himself a king and a ruler over us, 
that he may do with us according 
to his will and pleasure. And after 
this manner did my brother Laman 
b stir up their hearts to c anger.

39 And it came to pass that the Lord 
was with us, yea, even the voice of 
the Lord came and did speak many 
words  unto  them,  and  did  a chas-
ten  them  exceedingly;  and  after  
they were chastened by the voice of 
the Lord they did turn away their  
anger, and did repent of their sins, 

insomuch  that  the  Lord  did  bless 
us again with food, that we did not 
perish.

CHAPTER 17

Nephi is commanded to build a ship—
His brethren oppose him—He exhorts 
them  by  recounting  the  history  of  
God’s  dealings  with  Israel—Nephi  is  
filled  with  the  power  of  God—His 
brethren  are  forbidden  to  touch  him, 
lest they wither as a dried reed. About 
592–591 b.c.
And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  did 
again take our journey in the wil-
derness; and we did travel nearly 
eastward from that time forth. And 
we  did  travel  and  a wade  through 
much affliction in the wilderness; 
and our b women did bear children 
in the wilderness.

2 And so great were the a blessings 
of the Lord upon us, that while we 
did live upon b raw c meat in the wil-
derness, our women did give plenty 
of suck for their children, and were 
strong, yea, even like unto the men; 
and they began to bear their jour-
neyings without murmurings.

3 And thus we see that the com-
mandments of God must be fulfilled.  
And  if  it  so  be  that  the  children 
of  men  keep  the  commandments 
of God he doth nourish them, and 
a strengthen  them,  and  provide 
means  whereby  they  can  accom-
plish the thing which he has com-
manded  them;  wherefore,  he  did 
b provide means for us while we did 
sojourn in the wilderness.

4 And we did sojourn for the space 
of many years, yea, even eight years 
in the wilderness.

5 And  we  did  come  to  the  land 
which we called a Bountiful, because

of its much fruit and also wild honey;  
and all these things were prepared 
of the Lord that we might not per-
ish. And we beheld the sea, which 
we called Irreantum, which, being 
interpreted, is many waters.

6 And it came to pass that we did 
pitch  our  tents  by  the  seashore; 
and  notwithstanding  we  had  suf-
fered many a afflictions and much 
difficulty, yea, even so much that 
we cannot write them all, we were 
exceedingly rejoiced when we came 
to the seashore; and we called the 
place Bountiful, because of its much  
fruit.

7 And it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had been in the land of Boun-
tiful  for  the  space  of  many  days,  
the  voice  of  the  Lord  came  unto 
me, saying: a Arise, and get thee into 
the mountain. And it came to pass 
that I arose and went up into the 
mountain, and cried unto the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that the Lord 
spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt 
a construct  a  ship,  after  the  b man-
ner which I shall show thee, that I 
may carry thy people across these  
waters.

9 And I said: Lord, whither shall 
I go that I may find ore to molten, 
that I may make a tools to construct 
the  ship  after  the  manner  which 
thou hast shown unto me?

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord told me whither I should go 
to find ore, that I might make tools.
11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,  
did make a bellows wherewith to 
a blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; 
and after I had made a bellows, that 
I might have wherewith to blow the 

fire, I did smite two stones together 
that I might make fire.

12 For the Lord had not hitherto 
suffered that we should make much 
fire, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness;  for  he  said:  I  will  make  thy 
food become sweet, that ye  a cook  
it not;

13 And I will also be your a light in 
the wilderness; and I will prepare 
the way before you, if it so be that 
ye shall keep my commandments; 
wherefore,  inasmuch  as  ye  shall 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be led towards the b promised land; 
and ye shall c know that it is by me 
that ye are led.

14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: 
After ye have arrived in the prom-
ised land, ye shall a know that I, the 
Lord, am b God; and that I, the Lord, 
did c deliver you from destruction; 
yea, that I did bring you out of the 
land of Jerusalem.

15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive 
to keep the a commandments of the 
Lord, and I did b exhort my breth-
ren to faithfulness and diligence.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  
did  a make  tools  of  the  ore  which  
I did molten out of the rock.

17 And  when  my  brethren  saw 
that  I  was  about  to  a build  a  ship, 
they began to b murmur against me, 
saying: Our brother is a fool, for he 
thinketh that he can build a ship; 
yea, and he also thinketh that he 
can cross these great waters.

18 And  thus  my  brethren  did  
a complain  against  me,  and  were  
desirous that they might not labor, 
for they did not b believe that I could 
build  a  ship;  neither  would  they

believe  that  I  was  instructed  of 
the Lord.

19 And now it came to pass that I, 
Nephi, was exceedingly sorrowful 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts; and now when they saw that 
I began to be sorrowful they were 
glad in their hearts, insomuch that 
they did  a rejoice over me, saying: 
We  knew  that  ye  could  not  con-
struct a ship, for we knew that ye 
were lacking in judgment; where-
fore, thou canst not accomplish so 
great a work.

20 And  thou  art  like  unto  our 
father,  led  away  by  the  foolish 
a imagi nations  of  his  heart;  yea, 
he  hath  led  us  out  of  the  land  of  
Jerusalem, and we have wandered 
in  the  wilderness  for  these  many 
years; and our women have toiled, 
being big with child; and they have 
borne  children  in  the  wilderness 
and  suffered  all  things,  save  it 
were death; and it would have been  
better  that  they  had  died  before 
they  came  out  of  Jerusalem  than 
to have suffered these afflictions.

21 Behold,  these  many  years  we 
have  suffered  in  the  wilderness, 
which time we might have enjoyed 
our possessions and the land of our 
inheritance; yea, and we might have 
been happy.

22 And we know that the people 
who were in the land of Jerusalem 
were a a righteous people; for they 
kept  the  statutes  and  judgments 
of the Lord, and all his command-
ments,  according  to  the  law  of  
Moses;  wherefore,  we  know  that 
they are a righteous people; and our 

father hath judged them, and hath  
led  us  away  because  we  would 
hearken  unto  his  words;  yea,  and 
our brother is like unto him. And 
after this manner of language did 
my brethren murmur and complain 
against us.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do  
ye believe that our fathers, who were 
the children of Israel, would have 
been led away out of the hands of 
the a Egyptians if they had not heark-
ened unto the words of the Lord?

24 Yea,  do  ye  suppose  that  they 
would have been led out of bond-
age, if the Lord had not commanded 
Moses  that  he  should  a lead  them 
out of bondage?

25 Now ye know that the children 
of  Israel  were  in  a bondage;  and  
ye know that they were laden with 
b tasks, which were grievous to be 
borne; wherefore, ye know that it  
must  needs  be  a  good  thing  for 
them, that they should be c brought 
out of bondage.

26 Now ye know that a Moses was 
commanded of the Lord to do that 
great  work;  and  ye  know  that  by 
his b word the waters of the Red Sea 
were divided hither and thither, and 
they passed through on dry ground.
27 But ye know that the Egyptians 
were a drowned in the Red Sea, who 
were the armies of Pharaoh.

28 And ye also know that they were 
fed with a manna in the wilderness.
29 Yea,  and  ye  also  know  that  
Moses, by his word according to the 
power  of  God  which  was  in  him, 
a smote  the  rock,  and  there  came

forth  water,  that  the  children  of 
Israel might quench their thirst.

30 And  notwithstanding  they  
being led, the Lord their God, their 
Redeemer, going before them, a lead-
ing them by day and giving light 
unto them by night, and doing all 
things for them which were b expe-
dient for man to receive, they hard-
ened their hearts and blinded their 
minds, and c reviled against Moses 
and against the true and living God.
31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  ac-
cording to his word he did a destroy 
them; and according to his word he 
did b lead them; and according to his 
word he did do all things for them; 
and there was not any thing done 
save it were by his word.

32 And  after  they  had  crossed 
the river Jordan he did make them 
mighty unto the a driving out of the 
children of the land, yea, unto the 
scattering them to destruction.

33 And  now,  do  ye  suppose  that 
the children of this land, who were 
in the land of promise, who were 
driven  out  by  our  fathers,  do  ye 
suppose that they were righteous? 
Behold, I say unto you, Nay.

34 Do ye suppose that our fathers 
would have been more choice than 
they if they had been righteous? I 
say unto you, Nay.

35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all 
a flesh in one; he that is b righteous 
is c favored of God. But behold, this 

d people had rejected every word of 
God, and they were ripe in iniquity; 
and  the  fulness  of  the  wrath  of 
God was upon them; and the Lord 
did  curse  the  land  against  them, 
and bless it unto our fathers; yea, 
he did curse it against them unto 
their destruction, and he did bless 
it unto our fathers unto their ob-
taining power over it.

36 Behold, the Lord hath created 
the a earth that it should be b inhab-
ited; and he hath created his chil-
dren that they should possess it.

37 And he a raiseth up a righteous 
nation, and destroyeth the nations 
of the wicked.

38 And he leadeth away the righ-
teous into precious a lands, and the 
wicked he b destroyeth, and curseth 
the land unto them for their sakes.
39 He ruleth high in the heavens, 
for it is his throne, and this earth 
is his a footstool.

40 And he loveth those who will 
have him to be their God. Behold,  
he  loved  our  a fathers,  and  he  
b covenanted with them, yea, even 
Abraham, c Isaac, and d Jacob; and he  
remembered the covenants which  
he  had  made;  wherefore,  he  did 
bring them out of the land of    e Egypt.
41 And he did straiten them in the 
wilderness  with  his  rod;  for  they 
a hardened their hearts, even as ye 
have; and the Lord straitened them 
because of their iniquity. He sent

fiery flying b serpents among them; 
and after they were bitten he pre-
pared  a  way  that  they  might  be 
c healed; and the labor which they 
had  to  perform  was  to  look;  and 
because of the  d simpleness of the 
way, or the easiness of it, there were 
many who perished.

42 And they did harden their hearts  
from time to time, and they did a re-
vile against b Moses, and also against 
God;  nevertheless,  ye  know  that 
they were led forth by his matchless  
power into the land of promise.

43 And now, after all these things, 
the time has come that they have 
become  wicked,  yea,  nearly  unto 
ripeness; and I know not but they are 
at this day about to be a destroyed; 
for I know that the day must surely 
come that they must be destroyed, 
save a few only, who shall be led 
away into captivity.

44 Wherefore,  the  Lord  a com-
manded my father that he should 
depart into the wilderness; and the 
Jews also sought to take away his 
life; yea, and b ye also have sought 
to take away his life; wherefore, ye 
are murderers in your hearts and 
ye are like unto them.

45 Ye are a swift to do iniquity but 
slow  to  remember  the  Lord  your 
God. Ye have seen an b angel, and he 
spake unto you; yea, ye have heard 
his voice from time to time; and he 
hath spoken unto you in a still small 
voice, but ye were c past feeling, that 
ye could not feel his words; where-
fore, he has spoken unto you like 
unto  the  voice  of  thunder,  which 
did cause the earth to shake as if 
it were to divide asunder.

46 And ye also know that by the 

a power of his almighty word he can 
cause  the  earth  that  it  shall  pass  
away; yea, and ye know that by his  
word he can cause the rough places to  
be made smooth, and smooth places 
shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, 
that ye can be so hard in your hearts?
47 Behold,  my  soul  is  rent  with  
anguish  because  of  you,  and  my 
heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall 
be cast off forever. Behold, I am a full 
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that 
my frame has b no strength.

48 And now it came to pass that 
when I had spoken these words they  
were angry with me, and were desir-
ous to throw me into the depths of 
the sea; and as they came forth to lay 
their hands upon me I spake unto 
them,  saying:  In  the  name  of  the  
Almighty God, I command you that 
ye a touch me not, for I am filled with 
the  b power of God, even unto the 
consuming of my flesh; and whoso 
shall lay his hands upon me shall  
c wither even as a dried reed; and he 
shall be as naught before the power 
of God, for God shall smite him.

49 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  said  unto  them  that  they 
should  murmur  no  more  against 
their  father;  neither  should  they 
withhold their labor from me, for 
God  had  commanded  me  that  I 
should a build a ship.

50 And I said unto them: a If God 
had commanded me to do all things 
I could do them. If he should com-
mand  me  that  I  should  say  unto 
this water, be thou earth, it should 
be earth; and if I should say it, it 
would be done.

great  power,  and  has  wrought  so

many miracles among the children 
of men, how is it that he cannot a in-
struct me, that I should build a ship?
52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, said many things unto my 
brethren, insomuch that they were 
a confounded and could not contend 
against me; neither durst they lay 
their  hands  upon  me  nor  touch 
me  with  their  fingers,  even  for 
the space of many days. Now they 
durst not do this lest they should 
wither before me, so powerful was 
the b Spirit of God; and thus it had 
wrought upon them.

53 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  said  unto  me:  Stretch  forth 
thine hand again unto thy breth-
ren, and they shall not wither be-
fore  thee,  but  I  will  a shock  them, 
saith the Lord, and this will I do, 
that they may know that I am the 
Lord their God.

54 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I 
stretched forth my hand unto my 
brethren, and they did not wither 
before me; but the Lord did shake 
them, even according to the word 
which he had spoken.

55 And now, they said: We know 
of  a  surety  that  the  Lord  is  a with 
thee,  for  we  know  that  it  is  the 
power of the Lord that has shaken 
us. And they fell down before me, 
and were about to b worship me, but 
I would not suffer them, saying: I am 
thy brother, yea, even thy younger 
brother;  wherefore,  worship  the 
Lord thy God, and honor thy father 
and thy mother, that thy c days may 
be long in the land which the Lord 
thy God shall give thee.

CHAPTER 18
The ship is finished—The births of Jacob  
and  Joseph  are  mentioned —The  

company  embarks  for  the  promised 
land—The sons of Ishmael and their 
wives  join  in  revelry  and  rebellion—
Nephi is bound, and the ship is driven 
back  by  a  terrible  tempest—Nephi 
is  freed,  and  by  his  prayer  the  storm 
ceases—The people arrive in the prom-
ised land. About 591–589 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
a worship the Lord, and did go forth 
with me; and we did work timbers 
of curious b workmanship. And the 
Lord did show me from time to time 
after what manner I should work 
the timbers of the c ship.

2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the 
timbers  after  the  manner  which 
was  learned  by  men,  neither  did 
I build the ship after the manner 
of men; but I did build it after the 
manner which the Lord had shown 
unto me; wherefore, it was not after 
the manner of men.

3 And  I,  Nephi,  did  go  into  the 
mount oft, and I did a pray oft unto  
the Lord; wherefore the Lord b showed  
unto me c great things.

4 And it came to pass that after I had 
finished the ship, according to the  
word of the Lord, my brethren beheld 
that it was good, and that the work-
manship  thereof  was  exceedingly 
fine;  wherefore,  they  did  a humble 
themselves again before the Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the voice 
of the Lord came unto my father, 
that we should arise and go down 
into the ship.

6 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow, after we had prepared all 
things, much fruits and a meat from 
the wilderness, and honey in abun-
dance,  and  provisions  according 
to  that  which  the  Lord  had  com-
manded us, we did go down into the 
ship, with all our loading and our

b seeds,  and  whatsoever  thing  we 
had brought with us, every one ac-
cording  to  his  age;  wherefore,  we 
did all go down into the c ship, with 
our wives and our children.

7 And now, my father had begat 
two sons in the wilderness; the elder 
was called a Jacob and the younger 
b Joseph.

8 And it came to pass after we had 
all gone down into the ship, and had 
taken  with  us  our  provisions  and 
things which had been commanded 
us, we did put forth into the  a sea 
and  were  driven  forth  before  the 
wind towards the b promised land.
9 And after we had been  a driven 
forth before the wind for the space 
of many days, behold, my brethren 
and  the  sons  of  Ishmael  and  also 
their  wives  began  to  make  them-
selves  merry,  insomuch  that  they 
began to dance, and to sing, and to 
speak with much b rudeness, yea, even 
that they did forget by what power 
they had been brought thither; yea, 
they were lifted up unto exceeding 
rudeness.

10 And  I,  Nephi,  began  to  fear 
exceedingly  lest  the  Lord  should 
be angry with us, and smite us be-
cause of our iniquity, that we should 
be swallowed up in the depths of 
the  sea;  wherefore,  I,  Nephi,  be-
gan  to  speak  to  them  with  much 
soberness;  but  behold  they  were  
a angry with me, saying: We will not 
that our younger brother shall be a  
b ruler over us.

11 And it came to pass that Laman 
and Lemuel did take me and a bind 
me with cords, and they did treat 
me with much harshness; neverthe-
less, the Lord did suffer it that he 
might show forth his power, unto the  

fulfilling of his word which he had 
b spoken concerning the wicked.

12 And it came to pass that after 
they had bound me insomuch that 
I  could  not  move,  the  a compass, 
which  had  been  prepared  of  the 
Lord, did cease to work.

13 Wherefore,  they  knew  not 
whither they should steer the ship, 
insomuch that there arose a great 
a storm, yea, a great and terrible tem-
pest, and we were b driven back upon 
the  waters  for  the  space  of  three 
days; and they began to be fright-
ened exceedingly lest they should 
be drowned in the sea; nevertheless  
they did not loose me.

14 And on the fourth day, which 
we had been driven back, the tem-
pest began to be exceedingly sore.
15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
were about to be swallowed up in 
the  depths  of  the  sea.  And  after 
we had been driven back upon the 
waters for the space of four days, 
my brethren began to a see that the 
judgments of God were upon them, 
and that they must perish save that 
they  should  repent  of  their  iniq-
uities; wherefore, they came unto 
me,  and  loosed  the  bands  which 
were upon my wrists, and behold 
they had swollen exceedingly; and 
also mine ankles were much swol-
len,  and  great  was  the  soreness  
thereof.

16 Nevertheless,  I  did  look  unto 
my God, and I did a praise him all 
the day long; and I did not murmur 
against the Lord because of mine 
afflictions.

17 Now my father, Lehi, had said 
many  things  unto  them,  and  also 
unto the sons of a Ishmael; but, be-
hold,  they  did  breathe  out  much

threatenings  against  anyone  that 
should speak for me; and my parents  
being b stricken in years, and having  
c suffered much grief because of their  
d children, they were brought down, 
yea, even upon their sick-beds.

18 Because of their grief and much 
sorrow,  and  the  iniquity  of  my 
brethren, they were brought near 
even to be carried out of this time 
to meet their God; yea, their a grey 
hairs were about to be brought down 
to lie low in the dust; yea, even they 
were  near  to  be  cast  with  sorrow 
into a watery grave.

19 And Jacob and Joseph also, be-
ing  young,  having  need  of  much 
nourishment, were grieved because 
of the afflictions of their mother; 
and also a my wife with her tears and 
prayers, and also my children, did 
not soften the hearts of my breth-
ren that they would loose me.

20 And  there  was  nothing  save 
it  were  the  power  of  God,  which 
threatened them with destruction, 
could soften their  a hearts; where-
fore, when they saw that they were 
about  to  be  swallowed  up  in  the 
depths of the sea they repented of 
the thing which they had done, in-
somuch that they loosed me.

21 And it came to pass after they 
had loosed me, behold, I took the 
compass, and it did work whither I 
desired it. And it came to pass that 
I a prayed unto the Lord; and after 
I had prayed the winds did cease, 
and the storm did cease, and there 
was a great calm.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did guide the ship, that we 
sailed again towards the promised  
land.

23 And it came to pass that after 
we had sailed for the space of many 
days we did arrive at the a promised 

land; and we went forth upon the 
land, and did pitch our tents; and 
we did call it the promised land.

24 And it came to pass that we did 
begin to till the earth, and we be-
gan to plant seeds; yea, we did put 
all our a seeds into the earth, which 
we had brought from the land of 
Jerusalem. And it came to pass that 
they did grow exceedingly; where-
fore, we were blessed in abundance.
25 And it came to pass that we did 
find upon the land of promise, as 
we journeyed in the wilderness, that 
there were a beasts in the forests of 
every kind, both the cow and the 
ox, and the ass and the horse, and 
the goat and the wild goat, and all 
manner  of  wild  animals,  which 
were  for  the  use  of  men.  And  we 
did find all manner of b ore, both of 
c gold, and of silver, and of copper.

CHAPTER 19
Nephi makes plates of ore and records 
the  history  of  his  people—The  God 
of Israel will come six hundred years  
from  the  time  Lehi  left  Jerusalem— 
Nephi  tells  of  His  sufferings  and  
crucifixion—The Jews will be despised 
and scattered until the latter days, when 
they will return unto the Lord. About 
588–570 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Lord 
commanded  me,  wherefore  I  did 
make  plates  of  ore  that  I  might 
engraven  upon  them  the  a record 
of my people. And upon the plates 
which I made I did b engraven the 
record of my c father, and also our 
journeyings in the wilderness, and 
the  prophecies  of  my  father;  and 
also many of mine own prophecies 
have I engraven upon them.

when I made them that I should be

commanded  of  the  Lord  to  make 
a these plates; wherefore, the record 
of my father, and the genealogy of 
his fathers, and the more part of all 
our proceedings in the wilderness 
are engraven upon those first plates 
of which I have spoken; wherefore, 
the things which transpired before 
I made b these plates are, of a truth, 
more  particularly  made  mention 
upon the first plates.

3 And after I had made these plates 
by way of commandment, I, Nephi, 
received a commandment that the 
ministry  and  the  prophecies,  the 
more  plain  and  precious  parts  of 
them, should be written upon a these 
plates;  and  that  the  things  which 
were  written  should  be  kept  for 
the instruction of my people, who 
should  possess  the  land,  and  also 
for  other  b wise  purposes,  which 
purposes are known unto the Lord.
4 Wherefore,  I,  Nephi,  did  make  
a  record  upon  the  a other  plates, 
which gives an account, or which 
gives a greater account of the wars 
and  contentions  and  destructions  
of my people. And this have I done, 
and commanded my people what 
they  should  do  after  I  was  gone; 
and  that  these  plates  should  be 
handed down from one generation 
to another, or from one prophet to 
another,  until  further  command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And an account of my a making 
these plates shall be given hereafter;  
and then, behold, I proceed accord-

ing  to  that  which  I  have  spoken; 
and this I do that the more sacred 
things may be b kept for the knowl-
edge of my people.

6 Nevertheless, I do not a write any-
thing upon plates save it be that I 
think  it  be  b sacred.  And  now,  if  I 
do err, even did they err of old; not 
that I would excuse myself because 
of  other  men,  but  because  of  the 
c weakness which is in me, according 
to the flesh, I would excuse myself.
7 For the things which some men 
esteem to be of great worth, both 
to the body and soul, others set at 
a naught  and  trample  under  their 
feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel 
do men b trample under their feet; I 
say, trample under their feet but I 
would speak in other words—they 
set him at naught, and c hearken not 
to the voice of his counsels.

8 And behold he a cometh, accord-
ing  to  the  words  of  the  angel,  in 
b six hundred years from the time 
my father left Jerusalem.

9 And the world, because of their 
iniquity,  shall  judge  him  to  be  a 
thing  of  naught;  wherefore  they 
scourge him, and he suffereth it; and  
they  smite  him,  and  he  suffer eth 
it. Yea, they a spit upon him, and he 
suffereth it, because of his loving 
b kindness  and  his  c long-suffering 
towards the children of men.

10 And  the  a God  of  our  fathers, 
who were b led out of Egypt, out of 
bondage, and also were preserved 
in the wilderness by him, yea, the

1 NEPHI 19  : 11–17

c God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and 
the God of Jacob, d yieldeth himself, 
according to the words of the angel, 
as a man, into the hands of e wicked 
men, to be f  lifted up, according to 
the  words  of  g Zenock,  and  to  be 
h crucified, according to the words 
of Neum, and to be buried in a i sep-
ulchre, according to the words of 
j Zenos, which he spake concerning 
the three days of k darkness, which 
should be a sign given of his death 
unto those who should inhabit the 
isles  of  the  sea,  more  especially 
given  unto  those  who  are  of  the 
l house of Israel.

11 For thus spake the prophet: The 
Lord God surely shall a visit all the 
house  of  Israel  at  that  day,  some 
with  his  b voice,  because  of  their 
righteousness, unto their great joy 
and salvation, and others with the 
c thunderings and the lightnings of 
his power, by tempest, by fire, and 
by d smoke, and e vapor of f darkness, 
and by the opening of the  g earth, 
and by h mountains which shall be 
carried up.

12 And  a all  these  things  must 
surely come, saith the prophet b Ze-
nos. And the c rocks of the earth must 
rend; and because of the d groanings 
of the earth, many of the kings of 

the isles of the sea shall be wrought 
upon  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  to  ex-
claim: The God of nature suffers.

13 And  as  for  those  who  are  at 
Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they 
shall  be  a scourged  by  all  people, 
because  they  crucify  the  God  of 
Israel, and turn their hearts aside, 
rejecting  signs  and  wonders,  and 
the power and glory of the God of  
Israel.

14 And  because  they  turn  their 
hearts aside, saith the prophet, and  
have a despised the Holy One of Is-
rael, they shall wander in the flesh, 
and perish, and become a b hiss and 
a  c byword,  and  be  d hated  among 
all nations.

15 Nevertheless,  when  that  day 
cometh, saith the prophet, that they 
a no  more  b turn  aside  their  hearts 
against the Holy One of Israel, then 
will  he  remember  the  c covenants 
which he made to their fathers.

16 Yea,  then  will  he  remember 
the  a isles  of  the  sea;  yea,  and  all 
the people who are of the house of  
Israel, will I b gather in, saith the Lord,  
according to the words of the prophet 
Zenos,  from  the  four  quarters  of  
the earth.

17 Yea, and all the earth shall a see 
the salvation of the Lord, saith the

prophet;  every  nation,  kindred, 
tongue and people shall be blessed.
18 And I, Nephi, have written these 
things unto my people, that perhaps 
I  might  persuade  them  that  they 
would  a remember  the  Lord  their 
Redeemer.

19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the 
house of Israel, if it so be that they 
should obtain a these things.

20 For behold, I have workings in 
the  spirit,  which  doth  a weary  me 
even  that  all  my  joints  are  weak, 
for those who are at Jerusalem; for 
had not the Lord been merciful, to 
show  unto  me  concerning  them, 
even  as  he  had  prophets  of  old,  I 
should have perished also.

21 And  he  surely  did  show  unto 
the a prophets of old all things b con-
cerning them; and also he did show 
unto many concerning us; where-
fore, it must needs be that we know 
concerning them for they are writ-
ten upon the plates of brass.

22 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did teach my brethren these 
things; and it came to pass that I did 
read many things to them, which 
were engraven upon the a plates of 
brass,  that  they  might  know  con-
cerning the doings of the Lord in 
other lands, among people of old.

23 And  I  did  read  many  things 
unto  them  which  were  written 
in the  a books of Moses; but that I 
might more fully persuade them to 
believe in the Lord their Redeemer 
I  did  read  unto  them  that  which 
was written by the prophet b Isaiah; 
for I did c liken all scriptures unto 
us, that it might be for our d profit 
and learning.

24 Wherefore I spake unto them, 
saying:  Hear  ye  the  words  of  the 
prophet, ye who are a a remnant of 
the house of Israel, a b branch who 
have been broken off; c hear ye the 
words of the prophet, which were 
written unto all the house of Israel, 
and liken them unto yourselves, that 
ye may have hope as well as your 
brethren from whom ye have been 
broken  off;  for  after  this  manner 
has the prophet written.

CHAPTER 20
The  Lord  reveals  His  purposes  to  Is-
rael—Israel  has  been  chosen  in  the 
furnace of affliction and is to go forth 
from  Babylon—Compare  Isaiah  48. 
About 588–570 b.c.
a Hearken and hear this, O house of 
Jacob, who are called by the name of  
Israel, and are come forth out of the 
waters of Judah, or out of the wa-
ters of b baptism, who c swear by the 
name of the Lord, and make mention  
of the God of Israel, yet they swear 
d not in truth nor in righteousness.
2 Nevertheless,  they  call  them-
selves of the a holy city, but they do 
b not stay themselves upon the God 
of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts; 
yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.
3 Behold, I have declared the a for-
mer things from the beginning; and 
they went forth out of my mouth, 
and I showed them. I did show them 
suddenly.

4 And I did it because I knew that 
thou art obstinate, and thy a neck is 
an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

ning declared to thee; before it came

to  pass  I  a showed  them  thee;  and 
I  showed  them  for  fear  lest  thou 
shouldst say—Mine idol hath done 
them,  and  my  graven  image,  and 
my molten image hath commanded 
them.

6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; 
and will ye a not declare them? And 
that I have showed thee new things 
from this time, even hidden things, 
and thou didst not know them.

7 They are created now, and not 
from  the  beginning,  even  before 
the day when thou heardest them 
not they were declared unto thee, 
lest  thou  shouldst  say—Behold  I 
knew them.

8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, 
thou  knewest  not;  yea,  from  that 
time thine ear was not opened; for 
I knew that thou wouldst deal very 
treacherously,  and  wast  called  a 
a transgressor from the womb.

9 Nevertheless,  for  my  a name’s  
sake will I defer mine anger, and 
for  my  praise  will  I  refrain  from 
thee, that I cut thee not off.

10 For, behold, I have refined thee, 
I have chosen thee in the furnace 
of a affliction.

11 For  mine  own  sake,  yea,  for 
mine own sake will I do this, for I 
will not suffer my a name to be pol-
luted, and I will b not give my glory 
unto another.

12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and 
Israel my called, for I am he; I am 
the a first, and I am also the last.

13 Mine  hand  hath  also  a laid 
the  foundation  of  the  earth,  and 
my  right  hand  hath  spanned  the  

heavens. I b call unto them and they 
stand up together.

14 All  ye,  assemble  yourselves, 
and  hear;  who  among  them  hath 
declared these things unto them? 
The Lord hath loved him; yea, and 
he  will  a fulfil  his  word  which  he 
hath  declared  by  them;  and  he 
will  do  his  pleasure  on  b Babylon, 
and  his  arm  shall  come  upon  the  
Chaldeans.

15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, 
yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called 
a him  to  declare,  I  have  brought 
him,  and  he  shall  make  his  way 
prosperous.

16 Come ye near unto me; I have 
not  spoken  in  a secret;  from  the 
beginning,  from  the  time  that  it 
was  declared  have  I  spoken;  and 
the Lord God, and his b Spirit, hath  
sent me.

17 And  thus  saith  the  Lord,  thy 
a Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; 
I have sent him, the Lord thy God 
who  teacheth  thee  to  profit,  who 
b leadeth  thee  by  the  way  thou 
shouldst go, hath done it.

18 O that thou hadst hearkened to 
my a commandments—then had thy 
b peace been as a river, and thy righ-
teousness as the waves of the sea.

19 Thy a seed also had been as the 
sand;  the  offspring  of  thy  bowels 
like  the  gravel  thereof;  his  name 
should  not  have  been  cut  off  nor 
destroyed from before me.

20 a Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye 
from the b Chaldeans, with a voice 
of singing declare ye, tell this, utter

Lord  hath  redeemed  his  c servant 
Jacob.

21 And they a thirsted not; he led 
them through the deserts; he caused 
the waters to flow out of the b rock 
for them; he clave the rock also and 
the waters gushed out.

22 And notwithstanding he hath 
done all this, and greater also, there 
is  no  a peace,  saith  the  Lord,  unto 
the wicked.

CHAPTER 21
The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles  
and will free the prisoners—Israel will 
be gathered with power in the last days—
Kings  will  be  their  nursing  fathers—
Compare Isaiah 49. About 588–570 b.c.
a And  again:  Hearken,  O  ye  house 
of Israel, all ye that are broken off 
and are driven out because of the 
wickedness  of  the  pastors  of  my 
people; yea, all ye that are broken 
off, that are scattered abroad, who 
are  of  my  people,  O  house  of  Is-
rael. Listen, O b isles, unto me, and  
hearken  ye  people  from  c far;  the 
Lord hath called me from the womb; 
from the bowels of my mother hath 
he made mention of my name.

2 And  he  hath  made  my  mouth 
like a sharp sword; in the shadow of 
his hand hath he hid me, and made 
me a polished shaft; in his quiver  
hath he hid me;

3 And said unto me: Thou art my 
a servant, O Israel, in whom I will 
be glorified.

4 Then  I  said,  I  have  labored  in 
a vain,  I  have  spent  my  strength 
for naught and in vain; surely my 
judgment is with the Lord, and my 
work with my God.

5 And  now,  saith  the  Lord—that 
a formed me from the womb that I 
should be his servant, to bring Jacob 
again to him—though Israel be not 
gathered, yet shall I be glorious in 
the eyes of the Lord, and my God 
shall be my b strength.

6 And he said: It is a light thing 
that thou shouldst be my servant 
to raise up the a tribes of Jacob, and 
to restore the preserved of Israel. I 
will also give thee for a b light to the 
c Gentiles, that thou mayest be my 
salvation unto the ends of the earth.
7 Thus  saith  the  Lord,  the  Re-
deemer of Israel, his Holy One, to 
him whom man despiseth, to him 
whom the nations abhorreth, to ser-
vant of rulers: Kings shall see and 
arise,  princes  also  shall  worship, 
because of the Lord that is faithful.
8 Thus saith the Lord: In an accept-
able time have I heard thee, O isles 
of the sea, and in a day of salvation 
have I helped thee; and I will pre-
serve thee, and give thee a my ser-
vant for a covenant of the people, 
to establish the earth, to cause to 
inherit the desolate heritages;

9 That  thou  mayest  say  to  the  
a prisoners: Go forth; to them that 
sit in  b darkness: Show yourselves. 
They  shall  feed  in  the  ways,  and 
their c pastures shall be in all high 
places.

10 They shall not hunger nor thirst, 
neither shall the heat nor the sun 
smite them; for he that hath mercy 
on them shall lead them, even by 
the springs of water shall he guide 
them.

11 And I will make all my moun-
tains a way, and my a highways shall 
be exalted.

12 And  then,  O  house  of  Israel, 
behold, a these shall come from far; 
and  lo,  these  from  the  north  and 
from the west; and these from the 
land of Sinim.

13 a Sing,  O  heavens;  and  be  joy-
ful,  O  earth;  for  the  feet  of  those 
who are in the east shall be estab-
lished; and b break forth into sing-
ing, O mountains; for they shall be 
smitten no more; for the Lord hath 
comforted his people, and will have 
mercy upon his c afflicted.

14 But,  behold,  Zion  hath  said: 
The  Lord  hath  forsaken  me,  and 
my Lord hath forgotten me—but he  
will show that he hath not.

15 For  can  a  a woman  forget  her 
sucking child, that she should not 
have  b compassion  on  the  son  of 
her womb? Yea, they may  c forget, 
yet will I not forget thee, O house 
of Israel.

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon 
the a palms of my hands; thy walls 
are continually before me.

17 Thy children shall make haste 
against  thy  destroyers;  and  they 
that  made  thee  a waste  shall  go 
forth of thee.

18 Lift up thine eyes round about 
and behold; all these a gather them-
selves together, and they shall come 
to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, 
thou shalt surely clothe thee with 
them all, as with an ornament, and 
bind them on even as a bride.

19 For thy waste and thy desolate 
places, and the land of thy destruc-
tion, shall even now be too narrow 
by reason of the inhabitants; and 

they that swallowed thee up shall 
be far away.

20 The children whom thou shalt 
have, after thou hast lost the first, 
shall a again in thine ears say: The 
place is too strait for me; give place 
to me that I may dwell.

21 Then  shalt  thou  say  in  thine 
heart: Who hath begotten me these, 
seeing I have lost my children, and 
am  a desolate,  a  captive,  and  re-
moving to and fro? And who hath 
brought  up  these?  Behold,  I  was 
left alone; these, where have they  
been?

22 Thus  saith  the  Lord  God:  Be-
hold, I will lift up mine hand to the  
a Gentiles, and set up my b standard 
to the people; and they shall bring 
thy  sons  in  their  c arms,  and  thy 
daughters  shall  be  carried  upon 
their shoulders.

23 And a kings shall be thy b nursing 
fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers; they shall bow down 
to thee with their face towards the 
earth, and lick up the dust of thy 
feet;  and  thou  shalt  know  that  I 
am the Lord; for they shall not be 
ashamed that c wait for me.

24 For shall the prey be taken from 
the mighty, or the a lawful captives 
delivered?

25 But  thus  saith  the  Lord,  even 
the  captives  of  the  mighty  shall 
be  taken  away,  and  the  prey  of 
the terrible shall be delivered; for 
I will contend with him that con-
tendeth with thee, and I will save 
thy children.

CHAPTER 22

Israel will be scattered upon all the face 
of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse 
and nourish Israel with the gospel in 
the last days—Israel will be gathered 
and saved, and the wicked will burn as 
stubble—The kingdom of the devil will 
be destroyed, and Satan will be bound. 
About 588–570 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had read these things which 
were engraven upon the a plates of 
brass, my brethren came unto me 
and said unto me: What b meaneth 
these things which ye have read? 
Behold, are they to be understood 
according to things which are c spiri-
tual, which shall come to pass ac-
cording  to  the  spirit  and  not  the 
flesh?

2 And  I,  Nephi,  said  unto  them: 
Behold  they  were  a manifest  unto 
the  prophet  by  the  voice  of  the 
b Spirit;  for  by  the  Spirit  are  all 
things made known unto the c proph-
ets,  which  shall  come  upon  the 
children  of  men  according  to  the  
flesh.

3 Wherefore, the things of which 
I  have  read  are  things  pertaining 
to things both a temporal and spiri-
tual; for it appears that the house 
of  Israel,  sooner  or  later,  will  be 
b scattered upon all the face of the 
earth, and also c among all nations.

4 And behold, there are many who 
are already lost from the knowledge 
of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, 
the more part of all the a tribes have 
been b led away; and they are c scat-
tered to and fro upon the d isles of 
the sea; and whither they are none 
of us knoweth, save that we know 
that they have been led away.

5 And  since  they  have  been  led 
away, these things have been pro- 
phesied  concerning  them,  and  
also concerning all those who shall 
hereafter be scattered and be con-
founded, because of the Holy One 
of Israel; for against him will they 
a harden  their  hearts;  wherefore, 
they  shall  be  scattered  among 
all nations and shall be  b hated of  
all men.

6 Nevertheless, after they shall be 
a nursed  by  the  b Gentiles,  and  the 
Lord has lifted up his hand upon 
the Gentiles and set them up for a 
standard, and their c children have 
been  carried  in  their  arms,  and 
their daughters have been carried 
upon their shoulders, behold these 
things of which are spoken are tem-
poral;  for  thus  are  the  covenants 
of the Lord with our fathers; and 
it meaneth us in the days to come, 
and also all our brethren who are 
of the house of Israel.

7 And  it  meaneth  that  the  time 
cometh that after all the house of 
Israel have been scattered and con-
founded,  that  the  Lord  God  will 
raise up a mighty nation among the 
a Gentiles, yea, even upon the face 
of this land; and by them shall our 
seed be b scattered.

1 NEPHI 22  : 9–16

Lord God will proceed to do a a mar-
velous  work  among  the  b Gentiles, 
which shall be of great c worth unto 
our  seed;  wherefore,  it  is  likened 
unto their being nourished by the 
d Gentiles and being carried in their 
arms and upon their shoulders.

9 And  it  shall  also  be  of  a worth 
unto the Gentiles; and not only unto 
the Gentiles but b unto all the c house 
of Israel, unto the making known 
of the d covenants of the Father of 
heaven  unto  Abraham,  saying:  In 
thy e seed shall all the kindreds of 
the earth be f  blessed.

10 And I would, my brethren, that 
ye should know that all the kindreds 
of the earth cannot be blessed un-
less he shall make a bare his arm in 
the eyes of the nations.

11 Wherefore, the Lord God will 
proceed to make bare his arm in the 
eyes of all the a nations, in bringing 
about his covenants and his gospel 
unto  those  who  are  of  the  house 
of Israel.

12 Wherefore, he will a bring them 
again  out  of  b captivity,  and  they 
shall be  c gathered together to the 
lands  of  their  d inheritance;  and  
they  shall  be  e brought  out  of  ob-
scurity  and  out  of  f darkness;  and 
they  shall  know  that  the  g Lord  is 

their  h Savior and their Redeemer, 
the i  Mighty One of Israel.

13 And the blood of that great and 
a abominable church, which is the  
whore  of  all  the  earth,  shall  turn 
upon their own heads; for they shall 
b war  among  themselves,  and  the 
sword of their c own hands shall fall 
upon their own heads, and they shall 
be drunken with their own blood.
14 And every a nation which shall 
war against thee, O house of Israel,  
shall  be  turned  one  against  an-
other, and they shall b fall into the 
pit  which  they  digged  to  ensnare 
the people of the Lord. And all that  
c fight  against  Zion  shall  be  de-
stroyed, and that great whore, who 
hath  perverted  the  right  ways  of 
the Lord, yea, that great and abomi-
nable church, shall tumble to the 
d dust and great shall be the fall of it.
15 For behold, saith the prophet, 
the time cometh speedily that Sa-
tan shall have no more power over 
the hearts of the children of men; 
for the day soon cometh that all the 
proud and they who do wickedly 
shall  be  as  a stubble;  and  the  day 
cometh that they must be b burned.
16 For the time soon cometh that 
the fulness of the a wrath of God shall  
be poured out upon all the children

of men; for he will not suffer that the 
wicked shall destroy the righteous.
17 Wherefore, he will a preserve the 
b righteous by his power, even if it 
so be that the fulness of his wrath 
must  come,  and  the  righteous  be 
preserved, even unto the destruction 
of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, 
the  righteous  need  not  fear;  for 
thus saith the prophet, they shall 
be saved, even if it so be as by fire.
18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto 
you, that these things must shortly 
come; yea, even blood, and fire, and 
vapor of smoke must come; and it 
must needs be upon the face of this 
earth; and it cometh unto men ac-
cording to the flesh if it so be that 
they will harden their hearts against 
the Holy One of Israel.

19 For behold, the righteous shall 
not perish; for the time surely must 
come that all they who fight against 
Zion shall be cut off.

20 And the Lord will surely a pre-
pare a way for his people, unto the 
fulfilling  of  the  words  of  Moses, 
which he spake, saying: A b prophet 
shall  the  Lord  your  God  raise  up 
unto you, like unto me; him shall 
ye  hear  in  all  things  whatsoever 
he shall say unto you. And it shall 
come to pass that all those who will 
not hear that prophet shall be c cut 
off from among the people.

21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto 
you,  that  this  a prophet  of  whom 
Moses spake was the Holy One of 
Israel; wherefore, he shall execute 
b judgment in righteousness.

22 And the righteous need not fear, 

for they are those who shall not be 
confounded. But it is the kingdom 
of the devil, which shall be built up 
among the children of men, which 
kingdom is established among them 
which are in the flesh—

23 For the time speedily shall come 
that all a churches which are built 
up to get gain, and all those who 
are built up to get power over the 
flesh, and those who are built up 
to become b popular in the eyes of 
the world, and those who seek the 
lusts of the flesh and the things of 
the world, and to do all manner of 
iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who 
belong to the kingdom of the c devil 
are they who need fear, and tremble, 
and d quake; they are those who must 
be  brought  low  in  the  dust;  they 
are those who must be e consumed 
as stubble; and this is according to 
the words of the prophet.

24 And  the  time  cometh  speed-
ily that the righteous must be led 
up as  a calves of the stall, and the 
Holy  One  of  Israel  must  reign  in 
dominion, and might, and power, 
and great b glory.

25 And he a gathereth his children 
from the four quarters of the earth; 
and he numbereth his b sheep, and 
they know him; and there shall be 
one fold and one shepherd; and he 
shall  feed  his  sheep,  and  in  him 
they shall find c pasture.

26 And because of the a righteous-
ness  of  his  people,  b Satan  has  no 
power;  wherefore,  he  cannot  be 
loosed for the space of c many years; 
for he hath no power over the hearts

of  the  people,  for  they  dwell  in 
righteousness,  and  the  Holy  One 
of Israel d reigneth.

27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say 
unto you that all these a things must 
come according to the flesh.

28 But,  behold,  all  nations,  kin-
dreds,  tongues,  and  people  shall 
dwell safely in the Holy One of Is-
rael if it so be that they will a repent.
29 And now I, Nephi, make an end; 
for I durst not speak further as yet 
concerning these things.

30 Wherefore,  my  brethren,  I 

would that ye should consider that 
the things which have been written 
upon the a plates of brass are true; 
and  they  testify  that  a  man  must 
be obedient to the commandments 
of God.

31 Wherefore,  ye  need  not  sup-
pose that I and my father are the 
only ones that have testified, and 
also taught them. Wherefore, if ye 
shall be obedient to the a command-
ments, and endure to the end, ye 
shall be saved at the last day. And 
thus it is. Amen.

An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The Lord 
warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His journeyings in the wilderness, 
and so forth.

CHAPTER 1
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—
His seed will be scattered and smitten if 
they reject the Holy One of Israel—He 
exhorts  his  sons  to  put  on  the  armor 
of righteousness. About 588–570 b.c.

AND  now  it  came  to  pass  that  

   after  I,  Nephi,  had  made  an  
   end of teaching my brethren, 
our a father, Lehi, also spake many 
things  unto  them,  and  rehearsed 
unto  them,  how  great  things  the 
Lord had done for them in bringing 
them out of the land of Jerusalem.
2 And  he  spake  unto  them  con-
cerning their a rebellions upon the 
waters, and the mercies of God in 

sparing their lives, that they were 
not swallowed up in the sea.

3 And he also spake unto them con-
cerning the land of promise, which 
they had obtained—how a merciful 
the Lord had been in b warning us 
that we should flee out of the land 
of Jerusalem.

4 For, behold, said he, I have a seen 
a  b vision,  in  which  I  know  that  
c Jerusalem is d destroyed; and had we 
remained in Jerusalem we should 
also have e perished.

5 But,  said  he,  notwithstanding 
our  afflictions,  we  have  obtained 
a a land of promise, a land which is 
b choice above all other lands; a land  
which the Lord God hath c covenanted

with me should be a land for the 
inheritance  of  my  seed.  Yea,  the 
Lord  hath  d covenanted  this  land 
unto me, and to my children for-
ever, and also all those who should 
be e led out of other countries by the 
hand of the Lord.

6 Wherefore,  I,  Lehi,  prophesy 
according  to  the  workings  of  the 
Spirit  which  is  in  me,  that  there 
shall a none come into this land save 
they shall be brought by the hand 
of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, this  a land is conse-
crated  unto  him  whom  he  shall 
bring. And if it so be that they shall 
serve  him  according  to  the  com-
mandments which he hath given, 
it shall be a land of  b liberty unto 
them; wherefore, they shall never 
be brought down into captivity; if 
so, it shall be because of iniquity; 
for if iniquity shall abound c cursed 
shall  be  the  land  for  their  sakes, 
but unto the righteous it shall be 
blessed forever.

8 And  behold,  it  is  wisdom  that 
this land should be a kept as yet from 
the knowledge of other b nations; for 
behold, many nations would over-
run the land, that there would be 
no place for an inheritance.

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained 
a a promise, that b inasmuch as those 
whom the Lord God shall bring out 
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep 
his commandments, they shall c pros-
per upon the face of this land; and 
they  shall  be  kept  from  all  other 
nations, that they may possess this 
land unto themselves. And if it so be  
that they shall d keep his command-
ments they shall be blessed upon 
the face of this land, and there shall 

be none to molest them, nor to take 
away the land of their e inheritance; 
and they shall dwell safely forever.
10 But  behold,  when  the  time 
cometh that they shall dwindle in 
a unbelief, after they have received 
so great blessings from the hand of 
the  Lord—having  a  knowledge  of 
the  creation  of  the  earth,  and  all 
men, knowing the great and mar-
velous works of the Lord from the 
creation of the world; having power 
given them to do all things by faith; 
having all the commandments from 
the  beginning,  and  having  been 
brought  by  his  infinite  goodness 
into this precious land of promise—
behold, I say, if the day shall come 
that they will reject the Holy One 
of  Israel,  the  true  b Messiah,  their 
Redeemer  and  their  God,  behold, 
the judgments of him that is c just 
shall rest upon them.

11 Yea,  he  will  bring  a other  na-
tions unto them, and he will give 
unto them power, and he will take 
away from them the lands of their 
possessions, and he will cause them 
to be b scattered and smitten.

12 Yea, as one generation passeth 
to  another  there  shall  be  a blood-
sheds, and great visitations among 
them; wherefore, my sons, I would 
that  ye  would  remember;  yea,  I 
would that ye would hearken unto  
my words.

13 O that ye would awake; awake 
from a deep a sleep, yea, even from 
the  sleep  of  b hell,  and  shake  off 
the awful c chains by which ye are 
bound, which are the chains which 
bind the children of men, that they 
are carried away captive down to the  
eternal d gulf of misery and woe.

2 NEPHI 1  : 14–24

14 Awake! and arise from the dust, 
and hear the words of a trembling 
a parent, whose limbs ye must soon 
lay  down  in  the  cold  and  silent 
b grave,  from  whence  no  traveler 
can c return; a few more d days and 
I go the e way of all the earth.

15 But behold, the Lord hath a re-
deemed my soul from hell; I have 
beheld his b glory, and I am encircled 
about eternally in the c arms of his 
d love.

16 And I desire that ye should re-
member to observe the a statutes and 
the judgments of the Lord; behold, 
this  hath  been  the  anxiety  of  my 
soul from the beginning.

17 My  heart  hath  been  weighed 
down  with  sorrow  from  time  to 
time, for I have feared, lest for the 
hardness  of  your  hearts  the  Lord 
your God should come out in the 
fulness of his a wrath upon you, that 
ye be b cut off and destroyed forever;
18 Or, that a a cursing should come 
upon  you  for  the  space  of  b many 
generations; and ye are visited by 
sword, and by famine, and are hated, 
and  are  led  according  to  the  will 
and captivity of the c devil.

19 O  my  sons,  that  these  things 
might not come upon you, but that 
ye might be a choice and a a favored 
people of the Lord. But behold, his 
will be done; for his b ways are righ-
teousness forever.

20 And  he  hath  said  that:  a Inas-

much  as  ye  shall  keep  my  b com-
mandments ye shall c prosper in the 
land; but inasmuch as ye will not 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be cut off from my presence.

21 And  now  that  my  soul  might 
have joy in you, and that my heart 
might leave this world with glad-
ness  because  of  you,  that  I  might 
not be brought down with grief and 
sorrow to the grave, arise from the 
dust, my sons, and be a men, and be 
determined in b one mind and in one 
heart, united in all things, that ye 
may not come down into captivity;
22 That ye may not be a cursed with 
a sore cursing; and also, that ye may 
not incur the displeasure of a b just 
God upon you, unto the destruction, 
yea, the eternal destruction of both 
soul and body.

23 Awake, my sons; put on the ar-
mor of a righteousness. Shake off the 
b chains with which ye are bound, 
and  come  forth  out  of  obscurity, 
and arise from the dust.

24 Rebel  no  more  against  your 
brother,  whose  views  have  been 
a glorious,  and  who  hath  kept  the 
commandments from the time that 
we  left  Jerusalem;  and  who  hath 
been an instrument in the hands of 
God, in bringing us forth into the 
land of promise; for were it not for 
him, we must have perished with 
b hunger  in  the  wilderness;  never-
theless, ye sought to c take away his

life; yea, and he hath suffered much 
sorrow because of you.

25 And  I  exceedingly  fear  and 
tremble  because  of  you,  lest  he 
shall  suffer  again;  for  behold,  ye 
have  a accused him that he sought 
power and b authority over you; but 
I know that he hath not sought for 
power nor authority over you, but 
he  hath  sought  the  glory  of  God, 
and your own eternal welfare.

26 And ye have murmured because  
he  hath  been  plain  unto  you.  Ye  
say that he hath used  a sharpness;  
ye  say  that  he  hath  been  angry  
with you; but behold, his b sharpness 
was the sharpness of the power of 
the word of God, which was in him; 
and that which ye call anger was 
the truth, according to that which 
is in God, which he could not re-
strain, mani festing boldly concern-
ing your iniquities.

27 And it must needs be that the 
a power of God must be with him, 
even  unto  his  commanding  you 
that  ye  must  obey.  But  behold,  it 
was not he, but it was the b Spirit of 
the Lord which was in him, which 
c opened his mouth to utterance that 
he could not shut it.

28 And now my son, Laman, and 
also Lemuel and Sam, and also my 
sons who are the sons of Ishmael, 
behold, if ye will hearken unto the 
voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. 
And  if  ye  will  hearken  unto  him 
I  leave  unto  you  a  a blessing,  yea, 
even my first blessing.

29 But if ye will not hearken unto 
him I take away my a first blessing, 
yea, even my blessing, and it shall 
rest upon him.

30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto 
you: Behold, thou art the a servant 
of  Laban;  nevertheless,  thou  hast 

been brought out of the land of Je-
rusalem, and I know that thou art 
a true b friend unto my son, Nephi, 
forever.

31 Wherefore, because thou hast 
been  faithful  thy  seed  shall  be 
blessed  a with  his  seed,  that  they 
dwell in prosperity long upon the 
face of this land; and nothing, save it 
shall be iniquity among them, shall 
harm  or  disturb  their  prosperity 
upon the face of this land forever.
32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the 
commandments  of  the  Lord,  the 
Lord  hath  consecrated  this  land 
for  the  security  of  thy  seed  with 
the seed of my son.

CHAPTER 2
Redemption  comes  through  the  Holy 
Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is 
essential to existence and progression—
Adam fell that men might be—Men are 
free to choose liberty and eternal life. 
About 588–570 b.c.
And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: 
Thou art my a firstborn in the days 
of my tribulation in the wilderness. 
And behold, in thy childhood thou 
hast suffered afflictions and much 
sorrow, because of the rudeness of 
thy brethren.

2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn 
in  the  wilderness,  thou  knowest 
the greatness of God; and he shall 
consecrate  thine  a afflictions  for  
thy gain.

3 Wherefore,  thy  soul  shall  be 
blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely 
with  thy  brother,  Nephi;  and  thy 
days shall be a spent in the service 
of thy God. Wherefore, I know that 
thou art redeemed, because of the 
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for 
thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness

of time he cometh to bring salvation  
unto men.

4 And  thou  hast  a beheld  in  thy 
youth  his  glory;  wherefore,  thou 
art blessed even as they unto whom 
he shall minister in the flesh; for 
the  Spirit  is  the  same,  yesterday, 
today, and forever. And the way is 
prepared from the fall of man, and 
b salvation is c free.

5 And  men  are  instructed  suffi-
ciently that they a know good from 
evil. And the b law is given unto men. 
And by the law no flesh is  c justi-
fied; or, by the law men are d cut off. 
Yea, by the temporal law they were 
cut  off;  and  also,  by  the  spiritual 
law  they  perish  from  that  which 
is  good,  and  become  miserable  
forever.

6 Wherefore, a redemption cometh 
in and through the b Holy c Messiah; 
for he is full of d grace and truth.

7 Behold,  he  offereth  himself  a 
a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends 
of the law, unto all those who have 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit; 
and unto b none else can the c ends 
of the law be answered.

8 Wherefore, how great the impor-
tance to make these things known 
unto the inhabitants of the earth, 
that  they  may  know  that  there 
is  no  flesh  that  can  dwell  in  the  

presence of God, a save it be through 
the merits, and mercy, and grace of 
the Holy Messiah, who b layeth down 
his life according to the flesh, and 
taketh it again by the power of the 
Spirit,  that  he  may  bring  to  pass  
the c resurrection of the dead, being 
the first that should rise.

9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits 
unto  God,  inasmuch  as  he  shall 
make a intercession for all the chil-
dren of men; and they that believe 
in him shall be saved.

10 And  because  of  the  interces-
sion  for  a all,  all  men  come  unto 
God; wherefore, they stand in the 
presence of him, to be  b judged of 
him according to the truth and c ho-
liness which is in him. Wherefore, 
the ends of the law which the Holy 
One hath given, unto the inflicting 
of the d punishment which is affixed, 
which punishment that is affixed 
is in opposition to that of the hap-
piness which is affixed, to answer 
the ends of the e atonement—

11 For it must needs be, that there 
is an a opposition in all things. If not 
so, my firstborn in the wilderness, 
righteousness could not be brought 
to  pass,  neither  wickedness,  nei-
ther  holiness  nor  misery,  neither 
good nor bad. Wherefore, all things 
must needs be a compound in one;

wherefore, if it should be one body 
it must needs remain as dead, having  
no life neither death, nor corruption  
nor incorruption, happiness nor mis-
ery, neither sense nor insensibility.
12 Wherefore, it must needs have 
been created for a thing of naught; 
wherefore there would have been 
no  a purpose in the end of its cre-
ation. Wherefore, this thing must 
needs destroy the wisdom of God 
and his eternal purposes, and also 
the power, and the mercy, and the 
b justice of God.

13 And if ye shall say there is a no 
law, ye shall also say there is no sin. 
If  ye  shall  say  there  is  no  sin,  ye  
shall also say there is no righteous-
ness. And if there be no righteousness  
there be no happiness. And if there 
be no righteousness nor happiness 
there be no punishment nor misery. 
And if these things are not b there is 
no God. And if there is no God we 
are not, neither the earth; for there  
could  have  been  no  creation  of 
things, neither to act nor to be acted  
upon;  wherefore,  all  things  must 
have vanished away.

14 And now, my sons, I speak unto 
you these things for your profit and 
a learning;  for  there  is  a  God,  and 
he  hath  b created  all  things,  both 
the heavens and the earth, and all 
things that in them are, both things 
to act and things to be c acted upon.
15 And to bring about his eternal 

a purposes in the end of man, after 
he  had  b created  our  first  parents, 
and the beasts of the field and the 
c fowls  of  the  air,  and  in  fine,  all 
things  which  are  created,  it  must 
needs be that there was an opposi-
tion; even the d forbidden e fruit in 
f opposition to the g tree of life; the 
one being sweet and the other bitter.
16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave 
unto  man  that  he  should  a act  for 
himself. Wherefore, man could not 
b act  for  himself  save  it  should  be 
that he was c enticed by the one or 
the other.

17 And  I,  Lehi,  according  to  the 
things which I have read, must needs 
suppose that an a angel of God, ac-
cording to that which is written, had 
b fallen from heaven; wherefore, he 
became a c devil, having sought that 
which was evil before God.

18 And because he had fallen from 
heaven, and had become miserable 
forever, he a sought also the misery 
of all mankind. Wherefore, he said 
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, 
who is the devil, who is the father 
of all b lies, wherefore he said: Par-
take of the forbidden fruit, and ye 
shall not die, but ye shall be as God, 
c knowing good and evil.

19 And after Adam and Eve had 
a partaken  of  the  forbidden  fruit 
they were driven out of the garden 
of b Eden, to till the earth.

children; yea, even the  a family of 
all the earth.

21 And  the  days  of  the  children 
of  a men  were  prolonged,  accord-
ing  to  the  b will  of  God,  that  they 
might  c repent  while  in  the  flesh; 
wherefore,  their  state  became  a 
state of d probation, and their time 
was  lengthened,  according  to  the 
commandments which the Lord God 
gave unto the children of men. For 
he gave commandment that all men 
must repent; for he showed unto all 
men that they were e lost, because of 
the transgression of their parents.
22 And  now,  behold,  if  Adam 
had not transgressed he would not  
have  fallen,  but  he  would  have 
remained  in  the  garden  of   Eden. 
And all things which were created 
must  have  remained  in  the  same 
state in which they were after they 
were created; and they must have 
remained forever, and had no end.
23 And  they  would  have  had  no 
a children;  wherefore  they  would 
have remained in a state of inno-
cence, having no b joy, for they knew 
no misery; doing no good, for they 
knew no c sin.

24 But  behold,  all  things  have 
been  done  in  the  wisdom  of  him 
who a knoweth all things.

25 a Adam  b fell  that  men  might 
be; and men c are, that they might 
have d joy.

26 And  the  a Messiah  cometh  in 
the  fulness  of  time,  that  he  may 

b redeem the children of men from 
the fall. And because that they are 
c redeemed from the fall they have 
become d free forever, knowing good 
from  evil;  to  act  for  themselves 
and  not  to  be  acted  upon,  save  it 
be by the punishment of the e law 
at the great and last day, according 
to the commandments which God 
hath given.

27 Wherefore,  men  are  a free  ac-
cording to the b flesh; and c all things 
are d given them which are expedi-
ent unto man. And they are free to 
e choose  f  liberty  and  eternal  g life, 
through  the  great  Mediator  of  all 
men,  or  to  choose  captivity  and 
death, according to the captivity and 
power of the devil; for he seeketh 
that  all  men  might  be  h miserable 
like unto himself.

28 And  now,  my  sons,  I  would  
that  ye  should  look  to  the  great  
a Mediator,  and  hearken  unto  his 
great commandments; and be faith-
ful unto his words, and choose eter-
nal life, according to the will of his 
Holy Spirit;

29 And not choose eternal death, 
according  to  the  will  of  the  flesh 
and the a evil which is therein, which 
giveth the spirit of the devil power 
to b captivate, to bring you down to 
c hell, that he may reign over you in 
his own kingdom.

days of my probation; and I have

CHAPTER 3
Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in vi-
sion—He prophesied of Joseph Smith, 
the latter-day seer; of Moses, who would 
deliver Israel; and of the coming forth of 
the Book of Mormon. About 588–570 b.c.
And now I speak unto you, Joseph, 
my  a last-born. Thou wast born in 
the wilderness of mine afflictions; 
yea, in the days of my greatest sor-
row did thy mother bear thee.

2 And  may  the  Lord  consecrate 
also unto thee this a land, which is 
a most precious land, for thine in-
heritance  and  the  inheritance  of 
thy seed with thy brethren, for thy 
security forever, if it so be that ye 
shall  keep  the  commandments  of 
the Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, Joseph, my last-born, 
whom  I  have  brought  out  of  the 
wilderness of mine afflictions, may 
the Lord bless thee forever, for thy 
a seed shall not utterly be b destroyed.
4 For behold, thou art the fruit of 
my loins; and I am a descendant of 
a Joseph  who  was  carried  b captive 
into Egypt. And great were the c cov-
enants of the Lord which he made 
unto Joseph.

5 Wherefore, Joseph truly a saw our 
day.  And  he  obtained  a  b promise 
of the Lord, that out of the fruit of 
his loins the Lord God would raise 

up  a  c righteous  d branch  unto  the 
house of Israel; not the Messiah, but 
a branch which was to be broken 
off, nevertheless, to be remembered 
in the covenants of the Lord that 
the Messiah should be made e mani-
fest unto them in the latter days, in 
the spirit of power, unto the bring-
ing of them out of  f darkness unto 
light—yea, out of hidden darkness 
and out of captivity unto freedom.
6 For  Joseph  truly  testified,  say-
ing: A a seer shall the Lord my God 
raise up, who shall be a choice seer 
unto the fruit of my b loins.

7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith 
the  Lord  unto  me:  A  choice  a seer 
will I  b raise up out of the fruit of 
thy loins; and he shall be esteemed 
highly among the fruit of thy loins. 
And unto him will I give command-
ment  that  he  shall  do  a  work  for 
the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, 
which shall be of great worth unto 
them, even to the bringing of them 
to the c knowledge of the covenants 
which I have made with thy fathers.
8 And I will give unto him a com-
mandment that he shall do  a none 
other  work,  save  the  work  which 
I  shall  command  him.  And  I  will 
make him great in mine eyes; for 
he shall do my work.

9 And he shall be great like unto 
a Moses, whom I have said I would 
raise  up  unto  you,  to  b deliver  my 
c people, O house of Israel.

10 And  a Moses will I raise up, to 
deliver thy people out of the land of  
Egypt.

11 But a  a seer will I raise up out

of the fruit of thy loins; and unto 
him  will  I  give  b power  to  c bring 
forth my word unto the seed of thy 
loins—and not to the bringing forth 
my word only, saith the Lord, but 
to the convincing them of my word, 
which shall have already gone forth 
among them.

12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins 
shall  a write;  and  the  fruit  of  the 
loins of b Judah shall c write; and that 
which shall be written by the fruit of 
thy loins, and also that which shall 
be written by the fruit of the loins 
of Judah, shall grow together, unto 
the d confounding of e false doctrines 
and laying down of contentions, and 
establishing f peace among the fruit 
of  thy  loins,  and  g bringing  them 
to the h knowledge of their fathers 
in the latter days, and also to the 
knowledge of my covenants, saith  
the Lord.

13 And out of weakness he shall 
be made strong, in that day when 
my work shall commence among all 
my people, unto the restoring thee, 
O house of Israel, saith the Lord.

14 And  thus  prophesied  Joseph, 
saying:  Behold,  that  seer  will  the 
Lord  bless;  and  they  that  seek  to 
destroy him shall be confounded; 
for this promise, which I have ob-
tained of the Lord, of the fruit of 
my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, 
I  am  sure  of  the  fulfilling  of  this 
promise;

15 And his a name shall be called af-
ter me; and it shall be after the b name 
of his father. And he shall be c like 
unto me; for the thing, which the 
Lord shall bring forth by his hand,  

by the power of the Lord shall bring 
d my people unto e salvation.

16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I 
am sure of this thing, even as I am 
sure  of  the  promise  of  Moses;  for 
the Lord hath said unto me, I will 
a preserve thy seed forever.

17 And the Lord hath said: I will 
raise  up  a  Moses;  and  I  will  give 
power unto him in a rod; and I will 
give judgment unto him in writing. 
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that 
he shall speak much, for I will not 
make him mighty in speaking. But 
I will a write unto him my law, by 
the finger of mine own hand; and 
I will make a b spokesman for him.
18 And  the  Lord  said  unto  me 
also: I will raise up unto the fruit of 
thy loins; and I will make for him 
a spokesman. And I, behold, I will 
give  unto  him  that  he  shall  write 
the writing of the fruit of thy loins, 
unto the fruit of thy loins; and the 
spokesman  of  thy  loins  shall  de-
clare it.

19 And the words which he shall 
write shall be the words which are 
expedient in my wisdom should go 
forth  unto  the  a fruit  of  thy  loins. 
And it shall be as if the fruit of thy 
loins had cried unto them b from the 
dust; for I know their faith.

20 And  they  shall  a cry  from  the 
b dust;  yea,  even  repentance  unto 
their  brethren,  even  after  many 
generations  have  gone  by  them. 
And it shall come to pass that their 
cry shall go, even according to the 
simpleness of their words.

21 Because  of  their  faith  their 
a words  shall  proceed  forth  out  of

my mouth unto their brethren who 
are the fruit of thy loins; and the 
weakness of their words will I make 
strong in their faith, unto the re-
membering of my covenant which 
I made unto thy fathers.

22 And  now,  behold,  my  son  Jo-
seph,  after  this  manner  did  my 
father of old a prophesy.

23 Wherefore, because of this cov-
enant thou art a blessed; for thy seed  
shall not be destroyed, for they shall  
b hearken unto the words of the book.
24 And  there  shall  rise  up  a one 
mighty among them, who shall do 
much  good,  both  in  word  and  in 
deed,  being  an  instrument  in  the 
hands of God, with exceeding faith, 
to  work  mighty  wonders,  and  do 
that thing which is great in the sight 
of God, unto the bringing to pass 
much  b restoration unto the house 
of Israel, and unto the seed of thy  
brethren.

25 And  now,  blessed  art  thou, 
Joseph.  Behold,  thou  art  little; 
wherefore hearken unto the words 
of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall 
be done unto thee even according 
to the words which I have spoken. 
Remember the words of thy dying 
father. Amen.

CHAPTER 4
Lehi  counsels  and  blesses  his  poster-
ity—He  dies  and  is  buried—Nephi 
glories in the goodness of God—Nephi 
puts his trust in the Lord forever. About 
588–570 b.c.
And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning 
the prophecies of which my father 
hath  spoken,  concerning  a Joseph, 
who was carried into Egypt.

2 For  behold,  he  truly  prophe-
sied  concerning  all  his  seed.  And 
the  a prophecies  which  he  wrote, 
there are not many greater. And he 
prophe sied concerning us, and our 
future  generations;  and  they  are 
written upon the b plates of brass.

3 Wherefore, after my father had 
made an end of speaking concerning 
the prophecies of Joseph, he called 
the children of Laman, his sons, and 
his daughters, and said unto them: 
Behold, my sons, and my daughters, 
who  are  the  sons  and  the  daugh-
ters of my a firstborn, I would that 
ye should give ear unto my words.
4 For the Lord God hath said that: 
a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my com-
mandments ye shall prosper in the 
land; and inasmuch as ye will not 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be cut off from my presence.

5 But  behold,  my  sons  and  my 
daughters, I cannot go down to my 
grave save I should leave a a blessing 
upon you; for behold, I know that 
if ye are b brought up in the c way ye 
should go ye will not depart from it.
6 Wherefore,  if  ye  are  a cursed, 
behold,  I  leave  my  blessing  upon 
you, that the b cursing may be taken 
from  you  and  be  answered  upon 
the c heads of your parents.

7 Wherefore, because of my bless-
ing  the  Lord  God  will  a not  suffer 
that ye shall perish; wherefore, he 
will be b merciful unto you and unto 
your seed forever.

8 And it came to pass that after my 
father had made an end of speaking 
to the sons and daughters of Laman, 
he caused the sons and daughters of 
Lemuel to be brought before him.
9 And he spake unto them, saying:

2 NEPHI 4  : 10–23

Behold, my sons and my daughters, 
who are the sons and the daughters 
of  my  second  son;  behold  I  leave 
unto you the same blessing which 
I left unto the sons and daughters 
of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not 
utterly be destroyed; but in the end 
thy seed shall be blessed.

10 And it came to pass that when 
my father had made an end of speak-
ing  unto  them,  behold,  he  spake 
unto the sons of a Ishmael, yea, and 
even all his household.

11 And after he had made an end  
of  speaking  unto  them,  he  spake 
unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, 
and  thy  a seed;  for  thou  shalt  in-
herit the land like unto thy brother 
Nephi. And thy seed shall be num-
bered with his seed; and thou shalt 
be even like unto thy brother, and 
thy  seed  like  unto  his  seed;  and 
thou  shalt  be  blessed  in  all  thy  
days.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father, Lehi, had  a spoken unto all 
his  household,  according  to  the 
feelings of his heart and the Spirit 
of the Lord which was in him, he 
waxed b old. And it came to pass that 
he died, and was buried.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days after his death, Laman 
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael 
were a angry with me because of the 
admonitions of the Lord.

14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to 
speak unto them, according to his 
word; for I had spoken many things 
unto them, and also my father, be-
fore his death; many of which say-
ings are written upon mine a other 

plates; for a more history part are 
written upon mine other plates.

15 And  upon  a these  I  b write  the 
things  of  my  soul,  and  many  of 
the scriptures which are engraven 
upon  the  plates  of  brass.  For  my 
soul  c delighteth  in  the  scriptures, 
and my heart d pondereth them, and 
writeth them for the e learning and 
the profit of my children.

16 Behold,  my  a soul  delighteth 
in the things of the Lord; and my 
b heart pondereth continually upon 
the things which I have seen and  
heard.

17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding 
the great a goodness of the Lord, in 
showing me his great and marvel-
ous  works,  my  heart  exclaimeth: 
O  b wretched  man  that  I  am!  Yea, 
my heart c sorroweth because of my 
flesh; my soul grieveth because of 
mine iniquities.

18 I  am  encompassed  about,  be-
cause  of  the  temptations  and  the 
sins which do so easily a beset me.
19 And  when  I  desire  to  rejoice, 
my heart groaneth because of my 
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom 
I have a trusted.

20 My God hath been my a support; 
he hath led me through mine b af-
flictions in the wilderness; and he 
hath preserved me upon the waters 
of the great deep.

21 He  hath  filled  me  with  his 
a love,  even  unto  the  b consuming 
of my flesh.

22 He hath confounded mine a en-
emies, unto the causing of them to 
quake before me.

day, and he hath given me a knowl-
edge by b visions in the night-time.
24 And by day have I waxed bold 
in mighty a prayer before him; yea, 
my  voice  have  I  sent  up  on  high; 
and angels came down and minis-
tered unto me.

25 And upon the wings of his Spirit 
hath my body been a carried away 
upon exceedingly high mountains. 
And mine eyes have beheld great 
things, yea, even too great for man; 
therefore I was bidden that I should 
not write them.

26 O then, if I have seen so great 
things, if the Lord in his condescen-
sion unto the children of men hath 
a visited  men  in  so  much  b mercy, 
c why should my d heart weep and my 
soul linger in the valley of sorrow, 
and my flesh waste away, and my 
strength slacken, because of mine 
afflictions?

27 And  why  should  I  a yield  to 
sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why 
should I give way to b temptations, 
that the evil one have place in my 
heart to destroy my c peace and af-
flict my soul? Why am I d angry be-
cause of mine enemy ?

28 Awake,  my  soul!  No  longer 
a droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, 
and give place no more for the b en-
emy of my soul.

29 Do not a anger again because of 
mine enemies. Do not slacken my 
strength because of mine afflictions.
30 Rejoice, O my a heart, and cry 
unto  the  Lord,  and  say:  O  Lord,  I 
will  praise  thee  forever;  yea,  my 

soul will rejoice in thee, my God, 
and the b rock of my salvation.

31 O Lord, wilt thou a redeem my 
soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of 
the  hands  of  mine  enemies?  Wilt 
thou make me that I may shake at 
the appearance of b sin?

32 May  the  gates  of  hell  be  shut 
continually before me, because that 
my a heart is broken and my spirit 
is  contrite!  O  Lord,  wilt  thou  not 
shut the gates of thy righteousness 
before me, that I may b walk in the 
path of the low valley, that I may 
be strict in the plain road!

33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me 
around  in  the  robe  of  thy  a righ-
teousness! O Lord, wilt thou make 
a way for mine escape before mine 
b enemies! Wilt thou make my path 
straight before me! Wilt thou not 
place a stumbling block in my way—
but that thou wouldst clear my way 
before  me,  and  hedge  not  up  my 
way, but the ways of mine enemy.
34 O Lord, I have a trusted in thee, 
and I will  b trust in thee forever. I 
will not put my  c trust in the arm 
of flesh; for I know that cursed is 
he  that  putteth  his  d trust  in  the 
arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that 
putteth his trust in man or maketh 
flesh his arm.

35 Yea, I know that God will give 
a liberally to him that asketh. Yea, 
my God will give me, if I b ask c not 
amiss;  therefore  I  will  lift  up  my 
voice  unto  thee;  yea,  I  will  cry 
unto thee, my God, the d rock of my 
e righteousness.  Behold,  my  voice

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites separate themselves from 
the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses, 
and build a temple—Because of their 
unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from 
the  presence  of  the  Lord,  are  cursed, 
and become a scourge unto the Neph-
ites. About 588–559 b.c.
Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord 
my God, because of the  a anger of 
my brethren.

2 But behold, their a anger did in-
crease  against  me,  insomuch  that 
they did seek to take away my life.
3 Yea, they did murmur against me, 
saying: Our younger brother thinks 
to  a rule over us; and we have had 
much trial because of him; where-
fore, now let us slay him, that we 
may not be afflicted more because  
of  his  words.  For  behold,  we  will 
not have him to be our ruler; for it 
belongs unto us, who are the elder 
brethren, to b rule over this people.
4 Now I do not write upon these 
plates  all  the  words  which  they 
murmured against me. But it suf-
ficeth me to say, that they did seek 
to take away my life.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did a warn me, that I, b Nephi, 
should depart from them and flee 
into the wilderness, and all those 
who would go with me.

6 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
I, Nephi, did take my family, and 
also a Zoram and his family, and Sam, 
mine elder brother and his family, 

and Jacob and Joseph, my younger 
brethren, and also my sisters, and 
all  those  who  would  go  with  me. 
And all those who would go with 
me were those who believed in the 
b warnings  and  the  revelations  of 
God; wherefore, they did hearken 
unto my words.

7 And we did take our tents and 
whatsoever things were possible for 
us, and did journey in the wilderness  
for the space of many days. And af-
ter we had journeyed for the space 
of many days we did pitch our tents.
8 And my people would that we 
should call the name of the place 
a Nephi;  wherefore,  we  did  call  it 
Nephi.

9 And all those who were with me 
did take upon them to call them-
selves the a people of Nephi.

10 And we did observe to keep the 
judgments, and the  a statutes, and 
the commandments of the Lord in 
all  things,  according  to  the  b law 
of Moses.

11 And the Lord was with us; and  
we did a prosper exceedingly; for we  
did sow seed, and we did reap again 
in abundance. And we began to raise 
flocks, and herds, and ani mals of 
every kind.

12 And I, Nephi, had also brought 
the  records  which  were  engraven 
upon the a plates of brass; and also 
the  b ball,  or  c compass,  which  was 
prepared for my father by the hand 
of the Lord, according to that which 
is written.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
began to prosper exceedingly, and 
to multiply in the land.

14 And I, Nephi, did take the a sword 
of  Laban,  and  after  the  manner

of it did make many  b swords, lest 
by any means the people who were 
now called Lamanites should come 
upon us and destroy us; for I knew 
their  c hatred  towards  me  and  my 
children and those who were called 
my people.

15 And I did teach my people to 
a build  buildings,  and  to  b work  in 
all c manner of wood, and of d iron, 
and  of  copper,  and  of  e brass,  and 
of steel, and of f gold, and of silver, 
and  of  precious  ores,  which  were 
in great abundance.

16 And  I,  Nephi,  did  a build  a 
b temple; and I did construct it af-
ter  the  manner  of  the  temple  of 
c Solomon save it were not built of 
so many d precious things; for they 
were not to be found upon the land, 
wherefore, it could not be built like 
unto  Solomon’s  e temple.  But  the 
manner  of  the  construction  was 
like unto the temple of  f Solomon; 
and the workmanship thereof was 
exceedingly fine.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did cause my people to be 
a industrious, and to b labor with their  
c hands.

18 And it came to pass that they 
would that I should be their a king. 
But I, Nephi, was desirous that they 
should have no king; nevertheless, 
I  did  for  them  according  to  that 
which was in my power.

19 And behold, the words of the 
Lord  had  been  fulfilled  unto  my 

brethren, which he spake concern-
ing  them,  that  I  should  be  their 
a ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, 
I  had  been  their  ruler  and  their 
b teacher, according to the command-
ments of the Lord, until the time 
they sought to take away my life.

20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord 
was fulfilled which he spake unto 
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they 
will  a not hearken unto thy words 
they shall be b cut off from the pres-
ence of the Lord. And behold, they 
were c cut off from his presence.

21 And he had caused the  a curs-
ing to come upon them, yea, even 
a sore cursing, because of their in-
iquity. For behold, they had hard-
ened their hearts against him, that 
they had become like unto a flint; 
wherefore, as they were white, and 
exceedingly fair and b delightsome, 
that  they  might  not  be  c enticing 
unto my people the Lord God did 
cause a d skin of e blackness to come 
upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I 
will cause that they shall be a loath-
some  unto  thy  people,  save  they 
shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And cursed shall be the seed of 
him that  a mixeth with their seed; 
for they shall be cursed even with 
the  same  cursing.  And  the  Lord 
spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their a cursing 
which  was  upon  them  they  did 
become  an  b idle  people,  full  of

mischief and subtlety, and did seek 
in the wilderness for beasts of prey.
25 And  the  Lord  God  said  unto 
me: They shall be a scourge unto 
thy seed, to a stir them up in remem-
brance of me; and inasmuch as they 
will not remember me, and hearken 
unto my words, they shall scourge 
them even unto destruction.

26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,  
did  a consecrate Jacob and Joseph, 
that  they  should  be  b priests  and 
c teachers over the land of my people.
27 And it came to pass that we lived 

after the manner of a happiness.

28 And  thirty  years  had  passed 
away  from  the  time  we  left  Jeru-
salem.

29 And  I,  Nephi,  had  kept  the 
a records  upon  my  plates,  which  I 
had made, of my people thus far.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord God said unto me: a Make other 
plates;  and  thou  shalt  engraven 
many things upon them which are 
good in my sight, for the profit of 
thy people.

31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obe-
dient to the commandments of the 
Lord, went and made a these plates 
upon which I have engraven these 
things.

32 And  I  engraved  that  which 
is  pleasing  unto  God.  And  if  my 
people are pleased with the things 
of  God  they  will  be  pleased  with 
mine  engravings  which  are  upon 
these plates.

33 And  if  my  people  desire  to 
know the more particular part of 
the history of my people they must 
search mine a other b plates.

34 And it sufficeth me to say that 
forty  years  had  passed  away,  and 
we had already had wars and con-
tentions with our brethren.

CHAPTER 6

Jacob  recounts  Jewish  history:  The 
Babylonian  captivity  and  return;  the 
ministry  and  crucifixion  of  the  Holy 
One  of  Israel;  the  help  received  from 
the Gentiles; and the Jews’ latter-day 
restoration  when  they  believe  in  the 
Messiah. About 559–545 b.c.
The  a words  of  Jacob,  the  brother 
of Nephi, which he spake unto the 
people of Nephi:

2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, 
Jacob, having been called of God, 
and ordained after the manner of 
his  holy  a order,  and  having  been 
consecrated by my brother Nephi, 
unto whom ye look as a b king or a 
protector, and on whom ye depend 
for  safety,  behold  ye  know  that  I 
have spoken unto you exceedingly 
many things.

3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you 
again; for I am desirous for the a wel-
fare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety 
is great for you; and ye yourselves 
know  that  it  ever  has  been.  For  I 
have exhorted you with all diligence; 
and I have taught you the words of 
my father; and I have spoken unto 
you  concerning  all  things  which 
are  b written, from the creation of  
the world.

4 And now, behold, I would speak 
unto you concerning things which 
are, and which are to come; where-
fore, I will read you the words of 
a Isaiah.  And  they  are  the  words 
which my brother has desired that I 
should speak unto you. And I speak 
unto  you  for  your  sakes,  that  ye 
may learn and glorify the name of  
your God.

5 And now, the words which I shall 
read  are  they  which  Isaiah  spake 
concerning all the house of Israel;

wherefore,  they  may  be  a likened 
unto you, for ye are of the house of 
Israel. And there are many things 
which have been spoken by Isaiah 
which may be likened unto you, be-
cause ye are of the house of Israel.
6 And  now,  these  are  the  words: 
a Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, 
I  will  lift  up  mine  hand  to  the  
Gentiles, and set up my b standard 
to the people; and they shall bring 
thy  sons  in  their  arms,  and  thy  
daughters shall be carried upon their  
shoulders.

7 And a kings shall be thy nursing 
fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers; they shall bow down 
to thee with their faces towards the 
earth, and lick up the dust of thy 
feet;  and  thou  shalt  know  that  b I 
am the Lord; for they shall not be 
ashamed that c wait for me.

8 And now I, Jacob, would speak 
somewhat concerning these words. 
For behold, the Lord has shown me 
that those who were at a Jerusalem, 
from whence we came, have been 
b slain and c carried away captive.

9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown 
unto me that they should  a return 
again. And he also has shown unto 
me that the Lord God, the Holy One 
of Israel, should manifest himself 
unto  them  in  the  flesh;  and  after 
he  should  manifest  himself  they 
should  b scourge  him  and  c crucify 
him, according to the words of the 
angel who spake it unto me.

10 And after they have a hardened 
their  hearts  and  b stiffened  their 
necks against the Holy One of Israel, 
behold, the c judgments of the Holy 
One of Israel shall come upon them. 
And the day cometh that they shall 
be smitten and afflicted.

11 Wherefore, after they are driven 
to and fro, for thus saith the angel, 
many shall be afflicted in the flesh, 
and shall not be suffered to  a per-
ish, because of the prayers of the 
faithful; they shall be scattered, and 
smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the 
Lord will be merciful unto them, 
that b when they shall come to the 
c knowledge of their Redeemer, they 
shall  be  d gathered  together  again 
to the e lands of their inheritance.

12 And blessed are the a Gentiles, 
they of whom the prophet has writ-
ten; for behold, if it so be that they 
shall repent and fight not against 
Zion, and do not unite themselves to 
that great and b abominable church, 
they shall be saved; for the Lord God 
will fulfil his c covenants which he 
has made unto his children; and for 
this cause the prophet has written 
these things.

13 Wherefore,  they  that  fight 
against Zion and the covenant peo-
ple  of  the  Lord  shall  lick  up  the 
dust of their feet; and the people 
of the Lord shall not be a ashamed. 
For the people of the Lord are they 
who  b wait  for  him;  for  they  still 
wait for the coming of the Messiah.

time to recover them; wherefore, he 
will  b manifest  himself  unto  them 
in power and great glory, unto the 
c destruction of their enemies, when 
that  day  cometh  when  they  shall 
believe  in  him;  and  none  will  he 
destroy that believe in him.

15 And  they  that  believe  not  in 
him  shall  be  a destroyed,  both  by 
b fire, and by tempest, and by earth-
quakes, and by c bloodsheds, and by 
d pestilence,  and  by  e famine.  And 
they  shall  know  that  the  Lord  is 
God, the Holy One of Israel.

16 a For  shall  the  prey  be  taken 
from  the  mighty,  or  the  b lawful 
captive delivered?

17 But thus saith the Lord: Even 
the captives of the mighty shall be 
taken  away,  and  the  prey  of  the 
terrible shall be delivered; a for the 
b Mighty God shall c deliver his cov-
enant  people.  For  thus  saith  the 
Lord: I will contend with them that 
contendeth with thee—

18 And  I  will  feed  them  that  
oppress thee, with their own flesh; 
and  they  shall  be  drunken  with 
their  own  blood  as  with  sweet 
wine; and all flesh shall know that 
I the Lord am thy Savior and thy 
a Redeemer,  the  b Mighty  One  of  
Jacob.

CHAPTER 7

Jacob  continues  reading  from  Isaiah:  
Isaiah  speaks  messianically—The  
Messiah  will  have  the  tongue  of  the 
learned—He will give His back to the 
smiters—He will not be confounded—
Compare Isaiah 50. About 559–545 b.c.
a Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have 
I put thee away, or have I cast thee 
off forever? For thus saith the Lord: 
Where is the b bill of your mother’s 
c divorcement? To whom have I put 
thee away, or to which of my d credi-
tors have I e sold you? Yea, to whom 
have I sold you? Behold, for your 
iniquities have ye sold yourselves, 
and for your transgressions is your 
mother put away.

2 Wherefore,  when  I  came,  there 
was  no  man;  when  I  a called,  yea, 
there was none to answer. O house of  
Israel, is my hand shortened at all 
that it cannot redeem, or have I no 
power to deliver? Behold, at my re-
buke I b dry up the c sea, I make their 
d rivers a wilderness and their e fish 
to stink because the waters are dried 
up, and they die because of thirst.
3 I clothe the heavens with a black-
ness,  and  I  make  b sackcloth  their 
covering.

4 The Lord God hath given me the 
a tongue of the learned, that I should 
know how to speak a word in season 
unto thee, O house of Israel. When

ye  are  weary  he  waketh  morning 
by morning. He waketh mine ear 
to hear as the learned.

5 The Lord God hath opened mine 
a ear, and I was not rebellious, nei-
ther turned away back.

6 I  gave  my  back  to  the  a smiter, 
and my cheeks to them that plucked 
off the hair. I hid not my face from 
b shame and spitting.

7 For the Lord God will help me, 
therefore shall I not be confounded. 
Therefore have I set my face like 
a flint, and I know that I shall not 
be a ashamed.

8 And the Lord is near, and he a jus-
tifieth me. Who will contend with 
me? Let us stand together. Who is 
mine adversary ? Let him come near 
me, and I will b smite him with the 
strength of my mouth.

9 For the Lord God will help me. 
And all they who shall  a condemn 
me, behold, all they shall b wax old 
as  a  garment,  and  the  moth  shall 
eat them up.

10 Who is among you that feareth 
the Lord, that obeyeth the a voice of 
his servant, that b walketh in dark-
ness and hath no light?

11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, 
that compass yourselves about with 
sparks,  walk  in  the  light  of  a your 
fire and in the sparks which ye have 
kindled. b This shall ye have of mine 
hand—ye shall lie down in sorrow.

CHAPTER 8

Jacob continues reading from Isaiah: 
In the last days, the Lord will comfort 
Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed 

will  come  to  Zion  amid  great  joy—
Compare Isaiah 51 and 52:1–2. About 
559–545 b.c.
a Hearken unto me, ye that follow 
after righteousness. Look unto the 
b rock from whence ye are hewn, and 
to the hole of the pit from whence 
ye are digged.

2 Look unto Abraham, your a father, 
and unto b Sarah, she that bare you; 
for I called him alone, and blessed 
him.

3 For the Lord shall a comfort b Zion, 
he will comfort all her waste places; 
and he will make her  c wilderness 
like d Eden, and her desert like the 
garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness 
shall be found therein, thanksgiv-
ing and the voice of melody.

4 Hearken unto me, my people; and 
give ear unto me, O my nation; for 
a a law shall proceed from me, and 
I  will  make  my  judgment  to  rest 
for a b light for the people.

5 My  righteousness  is  near;  my 
a salvation is gone forth, and mine 
arm  shall  b judge  the  people.  The 
c isles  shall  wait  upon  me,  and  on 
mine arm shall they trust.

6 Lift up your eyes to the a heavens, 
and look upon the earth beneath; 
for the heavens shall b vanish away 
like  smoke,  and  the  earth  shall 
c wax old like a garment; and they 
that dwell therein shall die in like 
manner. But my salvation shall be 
forever, and my righteousness shall 
not be abolished.

7 Hearken unto me, ye that know

heart I have written my law, a fear

ye not the  b reproach of men, nei-
ther be ye afraid of their c revilings.
8 For  the  a moth  shall  eat  them 
up like a garment, and the worm 
shall  eat  them  like  wool.  But  my 
righteousness shall be forever, and 
my  salvation  from  generation  to 
generation.

9 a Awake, awake! Put on b strength, 
O arm of the Lord; awake as in the 
ancient days. Art thou not he that 
hath cut c Rahab, and wounded the 
d dragon?

10 Art thou not he who hath dried 
the sea, the waters of the great deep; 
that hath made the depths of the 
sea a a way for the ransomed to pass  
over?

11 Therefore, the a redeemed of the 
Lord shall b return, and come with 
c singing unto Zion; and everlasting 
joy and holiness shall be upon their 
heads; and they shall obtain glad-
ness and joy; sorrow and d mourning 
shall flee away.

12 a I am he; yea, I am he that com-
forteth you. Behold, who art thou, 
that  thou  shouldst  be  b afraid  of 
man, who shall die, and of the son 
of man, who shall be made like unto  
c grass?

13 And  a forgettest  the  Lord  thy 
maker,  that  hath  b stretched  forth 
the heavens, and laid the founda-
tions of the earth, and hast feared 
continually every day, because of 
the fury of the c oppressor, as if he 
were ready to destroy ? And where 
is the fury of the oppressor?

14 The  a captive  exile  hasteneth, 
that he may be loosed, and that he 

should not die in the pit, nor that 
his bread should fail.

15 But  I  am  the  Lord  thy  God, 
whose  a waves  roared;  the  Lord  of 
Hosts is my name.

16 And I have  a put my words in 
thy mouth, and have covered thee 
in the shadow of mine hand, that 
I  may  plant  the  heavens  and  lay 
the foundations of the earth, and 
say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my 
b people.

17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Je-
rusalem, which hast drunk at the 
hand  of  the  Lord  the  a cup  of  his 
b fury—thou hast drunken the dregs 
of the cup of trembling wrung out—
18 And none to guide her among 
all the sons she hath brought forth; 
neither that taketh her by the hand, 
of all the sons she hath brought up.
19 These two a sons are come unto 
thee, who shall be sorry for thee—
thy desolation and destruction, and 
the famine and the sword—and by 
whom shall I comfort thee?

20 Thy  sons  have  fainted,  save 
these two; they lie at the head of 
all the streets; as a wild bull in a 
net, they are full of the fury of the 
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

21 Therefore hear now this, thou 
afflicted,  and  a drunken,  and  not 
with wine:

22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord 
and thy God a pleadeth the cause of 
his people; behold, I have taken out 
of thine hand the cup of trembling, 
the  dregs  of  the  cup  of  my  fury; 
thou shalt no more drink it again.

CHAPTER 9

Jacob  explains  that  the  Jews  will  be 
gathered in all their lands of promise—
The Atonement ransoms man from the 
Fall—The bodies of the dead will come 
forth  from  the  grave,  and  their  spirits 
from hell and from paradise—They will 
be judged—The Atonement saves from 
death,  hell,  the  devil,  and  endless  tor-
ment—The righteous are to be saved in 
the kingdom of God—Penalties for sins 
are set forth—The Holy One of Israel is 
the keeper of the gate. About 559–545 b.c.
And  now,  my  beloved  brethren,  I 
have read these things that ye might 
know concerning the a covenants of 
the  Lord  that  he  has  covenanted 
with all the house of Israel—

2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, 
by the mouth of his holy prophets, 
even  from  the  beginning  down, 
from generation to generation, until 
the time comes that they shall be  

a restored to the true church and fold 
of God; when they shall be b gathered 
home to the c lands of their inheri-
tance, and shall be established in 
all their lands of promise.

3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I 
speak unto you these things that ye 
may rejoice, and a lift up your heads 
forever,  because  of  the  blessings 
which  the  Lord  God  shall  bestow 
upon your children.

4 For I know that ye have searched 
much,  many  of  you,  to  know  of 
things to come; wherefore I know 
that ye know that our a flesh must 
waste away and die; nevertheless, 
in our b bodies we shall see God.

5 Yea, I know that ye know that in 
the body he shall show himself unto 
those  at  Jerusalem,  from  whence 
we came; for it is expedient that it 
should  be  among  them;  for  it  be-
hooveth the great a Creator that he 
b suffereth himself to become c sub-
ject unto man in the flesh, and d die 
for e all men, that all men might be-
come subject unto him.

6 For as a death hath passed upon 
all men, to fulfil the merciful b plan 
of  the  great  Creator,  there  must 
needs be a power of c resurrection, 
and  the  resurrection  must  needs 
come  unto  man  by  reason  of  the 
d fall; and the fall came by reason 
of e transgression; and because man 
became  fallen  they  were  f cut  off 
from the g presence of the Lord.

7 Wherefore,  it  must  needs  be 
an  a infinite  b atonement—save  it 
should be an infinite atonement this

corruption could not put on incor-
ruption. Wherefore, the c first judg-
ment which came upon man must  
needs have d remained to an endless  
duration. And if so, this flesh must 
have laid down to rot and to crumble 
to its mother earth, to rise no more.
8 O the a wisdom of God, his b mercy 
and c grace! For behold, if the d flesh 
should rise no more our spirits must 
become subject to that angel who 
e fell  from  before  the  presence  of 
the  Eternal  God,  and  became  the 
f devil, to rise no more.

9 And  our  spirits  must  have  
become a like unto him, and we be-
come devils, b angels to a c devil, to 
be  d shut out from the presence of 
our  God,  and  to  remain  with  the 
father of e lies, in misery, like unto 
himself;  yea,  to  that  being  who 
f  beguiled  our  first  parents,  who 
g transformeth himself nigh unto an 
h angel of light, and i stirreth up the 
children of men unto j secret combi-
nations of murder and all manner 
of secret works of darkness.

10 O how great the  a goodness of 
our God, who prepareth a way for 
our b escape from the grasp of this 
awful monster; yea, that monster,  
c death  and  d hell,  which  I  call  the 
death of the body, and also the death  
of the spirit.

11 And  because  of  the  way  of 
a deliverance of our God, the Holy 
One of Israel, this b death, of which 
I have spoken, which is the tempo-
ral, shall deliver up its dead; which 
death is the grave.

12 And this a death of which I have 
spoken, which is the spiritual death, 
shall  deliver  up  its  dead;  which 
spiritual death is b hell; wherefore, 
death and hell must c deliver up their  
dead, and hell must deliver up its  
d captive e spirits, and the grave must 
deliver up its captive f  bodies, and 
the bodies and the g spirits of men 
will be h restored one to the other; 
and  it  is  by  the  power  of  the  res-
urrection of the Holy One of Israel.
13 O how great the a plan of our God!  
For on the other hand, the b paradise 
of God must deliver up the spirits of 
the righteous, and the grave deliver 
up the body of the righteous; and 
the spirit and the body is c restored 
to itself again, and all men become 
incorruptible, and d immortal, and 
they are living souls, having a e per-
fect f  knowledge like unto us in the 
flesh, save it be that our knowledge 
shall be perfect.

14 Wherefore, we shall have a a per-
fect  b knowledge  of  all  our  c guilt, 
and our d uncleanness, and our e na-
kedness;  and  the  righteous  shall

have a perfect knowledge of their 
enjoyment, and their f righteousness, 
being  g clothed  with  h purity,  yea, 
even with the i robe of righteousness.
15 And it shall come to pass that 
when all men shall have passed from 
this first death unto life, insomuch 
as they have become immortal, they 
must appear before the a judgment- 
seat of the Holy One of Israel; and 
then  cometh  the  b judgment,  and 
then must they be judged according  
to the holy judgment of God.

16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth,  
for the Lord God hath spoken it, and 
it is his eternal a word, which cannot 
b pass away, that they who are righ-
teous shall be righteous still, and 
they who are c filthy shall be d filthy 
still; wherefore, they who are filthy 
are the  e devil and his angels; and 
they shall go away into f everlasting 
fire, prepared for them; and their 
g torment  is  as  a  h lake  of  fire  and 
brimstone, whose flame ascendeth 
up forever and ever and has no end.
17 O the greatness and the a justice 
of our God! For he executeth all his  
words,  and  they  have  gone  forth 
out of his mouth, and his law must 
be b fulfilled.

18 But,  behold,  the  a righteous, 
the  b saints  of  the  Holy  One  of  Is-
rael, they who have believed in the 
Holy One of Israel, they who have 

endured the c crosses of the world, 
and despised the shame of it, they 
shall d inherit the e kingdom of God, 
which was prepared for them f from 
the  foundation  of  the  world,  and 
their g joy shall be full h forever.

19 O  the  greatness  of  the  mercy 
of our God, the Holy One of Israel! 
For he a delivereth his saints from 
that b awful monster the devil, and 
death,  and  c hell,  and  that  lake  of 
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment.

20 O how great the a holiness of our 
God!  For  he  b knoweth  c all  things, 
and there is not anything save he 
knows it.

21 And he cometh into the world 
that he may  a save all men if they 
will hearken unto his voice; for be-
hold, he suffereth the pains of all 
men, yea, the b pains of every living 
creature,  both  men,  women,  and 
children,  who  belong  to  the  fam-
ily of c Adam.

22 And he suffereth this that the 
resurrection  might  pass  upon  all 
men,  that  all  might  stand  before 
him at the great and judgment day.
23 And he commandeth all men 
that  they  must  a repent,  and  be 
b baptized  in  his  name,  having  
perfect  c faith  in  the  Holy  One  of  
Israel, or they cannot be saved in the  
kingdom of God.

24 And  if  they  will  not  repent 
and  believe  in  his  a name,  and  be 
baptized in his name, and b endure 
to the end, they must be c damned; 
for the Lord God, the Holy One of 
Israel, has spoken it.

25 Wherefore,  he  has  given  a  
a law;  and  where  there  is  b no  c law 
given there is no d punishment; and 
where there is no punishment there 
is  no  condemnation;  and  where 
there is no condemnation the mer-
cies of the Holy One of Israel have 
claim  upon  them,  because  of  the 
atonement; for they are delivered 
by the power of him.

26 For  the  a atonement  satisfieth 
the demands of his b justice upon all 
those who c have not the d law given 
to  them,  that  they  are  e delivered 
from that awful monster, death and 
f  hell, and the devil, and the lake of 
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment; and they are restored 
to that God who gave them g breath, 
which is the Holy One of Israel.

27 But wo unto him that has the 
a law  given,  yea,  that  has  all  the  
commandments of God, like unto us, 
and that b transgresseth them, and  

that c wasteth the days of his d pro-
bation, for awful is his state!

28 O that cunning a plan of the evil 
one! O the b vainness, and the frail-
ties,  and  the  c foolishness  of  men! 
When they are d learned they think 
they are e wise, and they f  hearken not 
unto the g counsel of God, for they 
set it aside, supposing they know of 
themselves, wherefore, their  h wis-
dom is foolishness and it profiteth 
them not. And they shall perish.

29 But  to  be  a learned  is  good  if 
they b hearken unto the c counsels of  
God.

30 But wo unto the a rich, who are 
b rich as to the things of the c world. 
For because they are rich they de-
spise the d poor, and they persecute 
the meek, and their e hearts are upon 
their  treasures;  wherefore,  their 
f treasure is their god. And behold, 
their  g treasure  shall  perish  with 
them also.

31 And wo unto the deaf that will 

not a hear; for they shall perish.

32 Wo  unto  the  a blind  that  will 

not see; for they shall perish also.

b return to God, and behold his face, 
and remain in their sins.

39 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  re-
member  the  awfulness  in  a trans-
gressing against that Holy God, and 
also  the  awfulness  of  yielding  to 
the enticings of that b cunning one. 
Remember, to be c carnally-minded 
is  d death,  and  to  be  e spiritually-
minded is f  life g eternal.

40 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  give  
ear  to  my  words.  Remember  the 
greatness of the Holy One of Israel. 
Do not say that I have spoken hard 
things against you; for if ye do, ye 
will  a revile against the  b truth; for 
I  have  spoken  the  words  of  your 
Maker. I know that the words of truth 
are c hard against all d uncleanness; 
but  the  e righteous  fear  them  not,  

for they love the truth and are not 
shaken.

41 O then, my beloved brethren, 
a come unto the Lord, the Holy One. 
Remember that his paths are righ-
teous. Behold, the b way for man is 
c narrow,  but  it  lieth  in  a  straight 
course before him, and the keeper 
of the d gate is the Holy One of Is-
rael; and he employeth no servant 
there; and there is none other way 
save it be by the gate; for he can-
not be deceived, for the Lord God 
is his name.

42 And whoso a knocketh, to him 
will  he  open;  and  the  b wise,  and 
the learned, and they that are rich, 
who are puffed up because of their 
c learning, and their  d wisdom, and 
their  riches—yea,  they  are  they 
whom he despiseth; and save they 
shall  cast  these  things  away,  and 
consider  themselves  e fools  before 
God, and come down in the depths 
of f  humility, he will not open unto 
them.

43 But the things of the wise and 
the  a prudent  shall  be  b hid  from 
them forever—yea, that happiness 
which is prepared for the saints.

44 O,  my  beloved  brethren,  re-
member my words. Behold, I take 
off my garments, and I shake them 
before you; I pray the God of my 
salvation that he view me with his

a all-searching  eye;  wherefore,  ye 
shall  know  at  the  last  day,  when 
all  men  shall  be  judged  of  their 
works,  that  the  God  of  Israel  did 
witness that I b shook your iniquities  
from my soul, and that I stand with 
brightness before him, and am c rid 
of your blood.

45 O, my beloved brethren, turn 
away from your sins; shake off the 
a chains of him that would bind you 
fast; come unto that God who is the 
b rock of your salvation.

46 Prepare your souls for that glo-
rious day when a justice shall be ad-
ministered unto the righteous, even 
the day of b judgment, that ye may 
not shrink with awful fear; that ye  
may not remember your awful c guilt 
in perfectness, and be constrained 
to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judg-
ments, O Lord God d Almighty—but 
I know my guilt; I transgressed thy 
law, and my transgressions are mine; 
and  the  devil  hath  e obtained  me, 
that I am a prey to his awful misery.
47 But behold, my brethren, is it 
expedient that I should awake you 
to an awful reality of these things? 
Would  I  harrow  up  your  souls  if 
your  minds  were  pure?  Would  I 
be plain unto you according to the 
plainness  of  the  truth  if  ye  were 
freed from sin?

48 Behold, if ye were holy I would 
speak unto you of holiness; but as 
ye are not holy, and ye look upon 
me as a a teacher, it must needs be 
expedient that I b teach you the con-
sequences of sin.

49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, 
and my heart  a delighteth in righ-
teousness; and I will b praise the holy  
name of my God.

50 Come, my brethren, every one 
that a thirsteth, come ye to the b wa-
ters; and he that hath no  c money, 
come buy and eat; yea, come buy 
wine and milk without money and 
without price.

51 Wherefore, do not spend money 
for that which is of no worth, nor 
your a labor for that which cannot 
b satisfy.  Hearken  diligently  unto 
me, and remember the words which 
I have spoken; and come unto the 
Holy One of Israel, and c feast upon 
that which perisheth not, neither 
can be corrupted, and let your soul 
delight in fatness.

52 Behold, my beloved brethren, 
remember the words of your God; 
pray unto him continually by day, 
and give a thanks unto his holy name 
by night. Let your hearts b rejoice.
53 And behold how great the a cov-
enants of the Lord, and how great his 
b condescensions unto the children of  
men; and because of his greatness, 
and his c grace and d mercy, he has 
promised unto us that our seed shall 
not utterly be destroyed, according 
to the flesh, but that he would e pre-
serve them; and in future genera-
tions they shall become a righteous 
f  branch unto the house of Israel.

54 And now, my brethren, I would 
speak  unto  you  more;  but  on  the 
morrow  I  will  declare  unto  you 
the remainder of my words. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

Jacob explains that the Jews will crucify 
their God—They will be scattered until 
they begin to believe in Him—America 
will be a land of liberty where no king 
will rule—Reconcile yourselves to God 
and gain salvation through His grace. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now I, Jacob, speak unto you 
again,  my  beloved  brethren,  con-
cerning  this  righteous  a branch  of 
which I have spoken.

2 For behold, the a promises which 
we have obtained are promises unto 
us according to the flesh; wherefore, 
as it has been shown unto me that 
many of our children shall perish 
in  the  flesh  because  of  b unbelief, 
nevertheless, God will be merciful 
unto many; and our children shall 
be  c restored,  that  they  may  come 
to  that  which  will  give  them  the 
true knowledge of their Redeemer.
3 Wherefore,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
it  must  needs  be  expedient  that 
Christ—for in the last night the a an-
gel spake unto me that this should 
be his name—should b come among 
the c Jews, among those who are the 
more wicked part of the world; and 
they  shall  d crucify  him—for  thus 
it  behooveth  our  God,  and  there 
is none other nation on earth that 
would e crucify their f God.

be  wrought  among  other  nations 
they would repent, and know that

5 But because of a priestcrafts and 
iniquities,  they  at  Jerusalem  will 
b stiffen  their  necks  against  him, 
that he be c crucified.

6 Wherefore, because of their in-
iquities, destructions, famines, a pes-
tilences, and bloodshed shall come 
upon them; and they who shall not 
be  destroyed  shall  be  b scattered 
among all nations.

7 But behold, thus saith the a Lord 
God:  b When  the  day  cometh  that 
they  shall  believe  in  me,  that  I 
am Christ, then have I covenanted 
with  their  fathers  that  they  shall 
be  c restored  in  the  flesh,  upon 
the earth, unto the d lands of their  
inheritance.

8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
they  shall  be  a gathered  in  from 
their  long  dispersion,  from  the 
b isles of the sea, and from the four 
parts of the earth; and the nations 
of the Gentiles shall be great in the 
eyes of me, saith God, in c carrying 
them  forth  to  the  lands  of  their  
inheritance.

9 a Yea,  the  kings  of  the  Gentiles 
shall be nursing fathers unto them, 
and their queens shall become nurs-
ing mothers; wherefore, the b prom-
ises of the Lord are great unto the 
Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and 
who can dispute?

10 But behold, this land, said God, 
shall be a land of thine inheritance, 
and the a Gentiles shall be blessed 
upon the land.

a liberty unto the Gentiles, and there 
shall be no  b kings upon the land, 
who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.
12 And  I  will  fortify  this  land 

a against all other nations.

13 And  he  that  a fighteth  against 

Zion shall b perish, saith God.

14 For he that raiseth up a a king 
against me shall perish, for I, the 
Lord, the  b king of heaven, will be 
their king, and I will be a c light unto 
them forever, that hear my words.
15 Wherefore, for this cause, that 
my  a covenants  may  be  fulfilled 
which I have made unto the children 
of  men,  that  I  will  do  unto  them 
while they are in the flesh, I must 
needs destroy the b secret works of 
c darkness, and of murders, and of 
abominations.

16 Wherefore,  he  that  a fighteth 
against  b Zion,  both  Jew  and  Gen-
tile, both bond and free, both male 
and female, c shall perish; for d they 
are they who are the e whore of all 
the earth; for f they who are g not for 
me are h against me, saith our God.
17 For I will a fulfil my b promises 
which I have made unto the chil-
dren  of  men,  that  I  will  do  unto 
them while they are in the flesh—
18 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, thus saith our God: I will afflict  
thy seed by the hand of the Gen-

tiles;  nevertheless,  I  will  a soften 
the  hearts  of  the  b Gentiles,  that 
they shall be like unto a father to 
them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall 
be c blessed and d numbered among 
the house of Israel.

19 Wherefore,  I  will  a consecrate 
this land unto thy seed, and them 
who shall be numbered among thy 
seed, forever, for the land of their 
inheritance; for it is a choice land, 
saith God unto me, above all other 
lands, wherefore I will have all men 
that dwell thereon that they shall 
worship me, saith God.

20 And now, my beloved brethren, 
seeing  that  our  merciful  God  has 
given  us  so  great  knowledge  con-
cerning these things, let us remem-
ber him, and lay aside our sins, and 
not hang down our heads, for we are 
not cast off; nevertheless, we have 
been a driven out of the land of our 
inheritance; but we have been led 
to a b better land, for the Lord has 
made the sea our c path, and we are 
upon an d isle of the sea.

21 But great are the promises of 
the Lord unto them who are upon 
the a isles of the sea; wherefore as it 
says isles, there must needs be more 
than  this,  and  they  are  inhabited 
also by our brethren.

a led away from time to time from 
the house of Israel, according to his 
will and pleasure. And now behold, 
the Lord remembereth all them who 
have been broken off, wherefore he 
remembereth us also.

23 Therefore, a cheer up your hearts, 
and remember that ye are b free to 
c act for yourselves—to d choose the 
way of everlasting death or the way 
of eternal life.

24 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren,  a reconcile  yourselves  to  the 
b will of God, and not to the will of 
the devil and the flesh; and remem-
ber,  after  ye  are  reconciled  unto 
God, that it is only in and through 
the c grace of God that ye are d saved.
25 Wherefore, may God a raise you 
from death by the power of the res-
urrection, and also from everlasting 
death by the power of the b atone-
ment, that ye may be received into 
the c eternal kingdom of God, that 
ye may praise him through grace 
divine. Amen.

CHAPTER 11

Jacob saw his Redeemer—The law of 
Moses  typifies  Christ  and  proves  He 
will come. About 559–545 b.c.
And now, a Jacob spake many more 
things to my people at that time; 
nevertheless only these things have I 
caused to be b written, for the things 
which I have written sufficeth me.

2 And now I, Nephi, write a more 
of the words of b Isaiah, for my soul 
delighteth in his words. For I will 
liken  his  words  unto  my  people, 
and  I  will  send  them  forth  unto 
all my children, for he verily c saw 
my d Redeemer, even as I have seen  
him.

3 And  my  brother,  Jacob,  also 
has  a seen him as I have seen him; 
wherefore, I will send their words 
forth  unto  my  children  to  prove 
unto them that my words are true. 
Wherefore, by the words of b three, 
God hath said, I will establish my 
word.  Nevertheless,  God  sendeth 
more  c witnesses,  and  he  proveth 
all his words.

4 Behold,  my  soul  delighteth  in 
a proving unto my people the truth 
of  the  b coming  of  Christ;  for,  for 
this  end  hath  the  c law  of  Moses 
been  given;  and  all  things  which 
have  been  given  of  God  from  the 
beginning of the world, unto man, 
are the d typifying of him.

5 And also my soul delighteth in 
the  a covenants of the Lord which 
he hath made to our fathers; yea, 
my  soul  delighteth  in  his  b grace, 
and in his justice, and power, and 
mercy in the great and eternal plan 
of c deliverance from death.

6 And my soul delighteth in prov-
ing unto my people that a save Christ 
should come all men must perish.
7 For if there be a no Christ there be 
no God; and if there be no God we

are not, for there could have been

c he is Christ, and he cometh in the 
fulness of his own time.

8 And  now  I  write  a some  of  the 
words of Isaiah, that whoso of my 
people shall see these words may 
lift up their hearts and rejoice for 
all men. Now these are the words, 
and  ye  may  liken  them  unto  you 
and unto all men.

CHAPTER 12
Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gath-
ering of Israel, and millennial judgment 
and peace—The proud and wicked will 
be brought low at the Second Coming—
Compare Isaiah 2. About 559–545 b.c.
a The  word  that  Isaiah,  the  son  of 
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and 
Jerusalem:

2 And it shall come to pass in the 
last days, a when the b mountain of 
the  Lord’s  c house  shall  be  estab-
lished in the top of the d mountains, 
and shall be exalted above the hills, 
and all nations shall flow unto it.

3 And many a people shall go and 
say, Come ye, and let us go up to 
the  b mountain of the Lord, to the 
c house of the God of Jacob; and he 
will teach us of his ways, and we 
will  d walk in his paths; for out of 
Zion shall go forth the law, and the 
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

4 And he shall a judge among the 
nations,  and  shall  rebuke  many 
people:  and  they  shall  beat  their 

swords into plow-shares, and their 
spears into pruning-hooks—nation 
shall not lift up sword against na-
tion, neither shall they learn war 
any more.

5 O house of Jacob, come ye and let 
us walk in the light of the Lord; yea, 
come, for ye have all a gone astray, 
every one to his b wicked ways.

6 Therefore,  O  Lord,  thou  hast 
forsaken thy people, the house of 
Jacob, because they be replenished 
from  the  east,  and  hearken  unto 
a soothsayers  like  the  b Philistines, 
and they please themselves in the 
children of strangers.

7 Their land also is full of silver 
and gold, neither is there any end 
of their a treasures; their land is also 
full of horses, neither is there any 
end of their chariots.

8 Their land is also full of a idols; 
they worship the work of their own 
hands, that which their own fingers 
have made.

9 And the mean man a boweth b not 
down, and the great man humbleth 
himself not, therefore, forgive him 
not.

10 O ye wicked ones, enter into the 
rock, and a hide thee in the dust, for 
the fear of the Lord and the glory 
of his majesty shall smite thee.

11 And it shall come to pass that 
the a lofty looks of man shall be hum-
bled, and the haughtiness of men 
shall be bowed down, and the Lord 
alone shall be exalted in that day.

Hosts soon cometh upon all nations, 
yea, upon every one; yea, upon the 
b proud and lofty, and upon every 
one who is lifted up, and he shall 
be brought low.

13 Yea,  and  the  day  of  the  Lord 
shall  come  upon  all  the  a cedars 
of Lebanon, for they are high and 
lifted up; and upon all the oaks of 
Bashan;

14 And upon all the a high moun-
tains,  and  upon  all  the  hills,  and 
upon all the nations which are lifted 
up, and upon every people;

15 And  upon  every  a high  tower, 

and upon every fenced wall;

16 And upon all the ships of the a sea, 
and upon all the ships of Tarshish,  
and upon all pleasant pictures.

17 And the loftiness of man shall 
be bowed down, and the a haughti-
ness of men shall be made low; and 
the Lord alone shall be exalted in 
b that day.

18 And the idols he shall utterly 

abolish.

19 And they shall go into the holes 
of the rocks, and into the caves of the 
earth, for the fear of the Lord shall 
come upon them and the a glory of his  
majesty shall smite them, when he 
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
20 In  that  day  a  man  shall  cast 
his idols of silver, and his idols of 
gold, which he hath made for him-
self to worship, to the moles and to  
the bats;

21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, 
and into the tops of the ragged rocks, 
for the fear of the Lord shall come 
upon them and the majesty of his 
glory  shall  smite  them,  when  he 
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

CHAPTER 13

Judah and Jerusalem will be punished 
for their disobedience—The Lord pleads 
for and judges His people—The daugh-
ters of Zion are cursed and tormented 
for their worldliness—Compare Isaiah 
3. About 559–545 b.c.
a For behold, the Lord, the Lord of 
Hosts, doth take away from Jerusa-
lem, and from Judah, the stay and 
the staff, the whole staff of bread, 
and the whole stay of water—

2 The a mighty man, and the man 
of b war, the judge, and the prophet, 
and the c prudent, and the ancient;
3 The  captain  of  fifty,  and  the 
honorable man, and the counselor, 
and the cunning artificer, and the 
eloquent orator.

4 And  I  will  give  children  unto 
them to be their princes, and babes 
shall rule over them.

5 And  the  people  shall  be  a op-
pressed,  every  one  by  another, 
and every one by his neighbor; the 
child shall behave himself b proudly 
against  the  ancient,  and  the  base 
against the honorable.

6 When a man shall take hold of his 
brother of the house of his father, 
and shall say: Thou hast clothing, 
be thou our ruler, and let not this 
a ruin come under thy hand—

7 In that day shall he swear, say-
ing: I will not be a healer; for in my 
house  there  is  neither  bread  nor 
clothing; make me not a ruler of the  
people.

as b Sodom, and they cannot hide it. 
Wo unto their souls, for they have 
rewarded evil unto themselves!

10 Say unto the righteous that it is 
a well with them; for they shall b eat 
the fruit of their doings.

11 Wo unto the wicked, for they 
shall perish; for the reward of their 
hands shall be upon them!

12 And  my  people,  children  are 
their oppressors, and women rule 
over them. O my people, they who 
a lead thee cause thee to err and de-
stroy the way of thy paths.

13 The Lord standeth up to a plead, 
and standeth to judge the people.
14 The Lord will enter into a judg-
ment with the ancients of his peo-
ple and the princes thereof; for ye 
have eaten up the b vineyard and the 
spoil of the c poor in your houses.

15 What  mean  ye?  Ye  a beat  my  
people  to  pieces,  and  grind  the 
faces  of  the  poor,  saith  the  Lord 
God of Hosts.

16 Moreover,  the  Lord  saith:  Be-
cause  the  daughters  of  Zion  are 
a haughty, and b walk with stretched-
forth necks and wanton eyes, walk-
ing  and  mincing  as  they  go,  and 
making a tinkling with their feet—
17 Therefore the Lord will smite 
with a a scab the crown of the head 
of the daughters of Zion, and the 
Lord  will  b discover  their  secret  
parts.

18 In that a day the Lord will take 
away the bravery of their tinkling 
ornaments,  and  cauls,  and  round 
tires like the moon;

19 The chains and the bracelets, 

and the mufflers;

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments 
of the legs, and the headbands, and 
the tablets, and the ear-rings;

21 The rings, and nose jewels;
22 The changeable suits of apparel, 
and the mantles, and the wimples, 
and the crisping-pins;

23 The glasses, and the fine linen, 

and hoods, and the veils.

24 And it shall come to pass, in-
stead of sweet smell there shall be 
stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; 
and instead of well set hair, a bald-
ness; and instead of a stomacher, a 
girding of sackcloth;  b burning in-
stead of c beauty.

25 Thy men shall fall by the sword 

and thy mighty in the war.

26 And her a gates shall lament and 
b mourn; and she shall be desolate, 
and shall c sit upon the ground.

CHAPTER 14
Zion and her daughters will be redeemed 
and cleansed in the millennial day—
Compare Isaiah 4. About 559–545 b.c.
a And in that day, seven women shall 
take hold of one man, saying: We 
will eat our own bread, and wear 
our  own  apparel;  only  let  us  be 
called  by  thy  name  to  take  away 
our b reproach.

2 In that day shall the a branch of 
the Lord be beautiful and glorious; 
the fruit of the earth excellent and

comely  to  them  that  are  escaped 
of Israel.

3 And it shall come to pass, they 
that are a left in Zion and remain in 
Jerusalem shall be called holy, ev-
ery one that is written among the 
living in Jerusalem—

4 When the Lord shall have a washed 
away the filth of the daughters of 
Zion,  and  shall  have  purged  the 
blood of Jerusalem from the midst 
thereof by the spirit of judgment 
and by the spirit of b burning.

5 And the a Lord will create upon 
every dwelling-place of mount Zion,  
and upon her assemblies, a b cloud 
and smoke by day and the shining of  
a flaming fire by night; for upon all 
the glory of Zion shall be a defence.
6 And there shall be a tabernacle 
for a shadow in the daytime from the  
heat, and for a place of a refuge, and 
a covert from storm and from rain.

CHAPTER 15
The  Lord’s  vineyard  (Israel)  will  be-
come  desolate,  and  His  people  will 
be  scattered—Woes  will  come  upon 
them  in  their  apostate  and  scattered 
state—The  Lord  will  lift  an  ensign 
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 5. 
About 559–545 b.c.
a And then will I sing to my well- 
beloved a song of my beloved, touch-
ing his b vineyard. My well-beloved  
hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.
2 And he fenced it, and gathered 
out the stones thereof, and planted 
it with the choicest a vine, and built 
a tower in the midst of it, and also 
made a wine-press therein; and he 
looked  that  it  should  bring  forth 
grapes,  and  it  brought  forth  wild 
grapes.

3 And  now,  O  inhabitants  of  
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, 
I  pray  you,  betwixt  me  and  my 
vineyard.

4 What  could  have  been  done 
more  to  my  vineyard  that  I  have 
not  done  in  it?  Wherefore,  when 
I looked that it should bring forth 
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.
5 And  now  go  to;  I  will  tell  you 
what  I  will  do  to  my  vineyard—I 
will a take away the hedge thereof, 
and it shall be eaten up; and I will 
break down the wall thereof, and 
it shall be trodden down;

6 And I will lay it waste; it shall 
not be pruned nor digged; but there 
shall come up a briers and thorns; I 
will also command the clouds that 
they b rain no rain upon it.

7 For the a vineyard of the Lord of 
Hosts is the house of Israel, and the 
men  of  Judah  his  pleasant  plant; 
and he looked for b judgment, and 
behold, c oppression; for righteous-
ness, but behold, a cry.

8 Wo unto them that join a house 
to house, till there can be no place, 
that they may be placed alone in 
the midst of the earth!

9 In  mine  ears,  said  the  Lord  of 
Hosts, of a truth many houses shall 
be desolate, and great and fair cit-
ies without inhabitant.

10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall 
yield one a bath, and the seed of a 
homer shall yield an ephah.

11 Wo  unto  them  that  rise  up 
early in the morning, that they may 
a follow strong drink, that continue 
until  night,  and  b wine  inflame  
them!

12 And the harp, and the a viol, the 
tabret, and pipe, and wine are in 
their  feasts;  but  they  b regard  not

the work of the Lord, neither con-
sider the operation of his hands.

13 Therefore, my people are gone 
into  a captivity, because they have 
no b knowledge; and their honorable 
men are famished, and their mul-
titude dried up with thirst.

14 Therefore, hell hath enlarged her-
self, and opened her mouth without 
measure; and their glory, and their 
multitude, and their pomp, and he 
that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
15 And  the  mean  man  shall  be 
a brought  down,  and  the  b mighty 
man  shall  be  humbled,  and  the 
eyes of the c lofty shall be humbled.
16 But the Lord of Hosts shall be 
exalted in a judgment, and God that 
is holy shall be sanctified in righ-
teousness.

17 Then shall the lambs feed after 
their manner, and the waste places 
of the a fat ones shall strangers eat.
18 Wo unto them that draw iniq-
uity with cords of a vanity, and sin 
as it were with a cart rope;

19 That say: Let him a make speed, 
b hasten his work, that we may c see 
it; and let the counsel of the Holy 
One of Israel draw nigh and come, 
that we may know it.

20 Wo  unto  them  that  a call  b evil 
good, and good evil, that put c dark-
ness  for  light,  and  light  for  dark-
ness, that put bitter for sweet, and 
sweet for bitter!

21 Wo unto the a wise in their own  
eyes and b prudent in their own sight!
22 Wo  unto  the  mighty  to  drink 
a wine, and men of strength to min-
gle strong drink;

23 Who justify the wicked for a re-
ward, and take away the righteous-
ness of the righteous from him!

24 Therefore, as the a fire devoureth 
the  b stubble,  and  the  flame  con-
sumeth the c chaff, their d root shall 
be rottenness, and their blossoms 
shall  go  up  as  dust;  because  they 
have cast away the law of the Lord 
of Hosts, and e despised the word of 
the Holy One of Israel.

25 Therefore, is the a anger of the 
Lord  kindled  against  his  people, 
and  he  hath  stretched  forth  his 
hand against them, and hath smit-
ten  them;  and  the  hills  did  trem-
ble, and their carcasses were torn 
in the midst of the streets. For all 
this his anger is not turned away, 
but his hand is stretched out still.
26 And he will lift up an a ensign 
to the  b nations from far, and will 
hiss unto them from the c end of the 
earth; and behold, they shall d come 
with  speed  swiftly;  none  shall  be 
weary nor stumble among them.

27 None shall slumber nor sleep; 
neither  shall  the  girdle  of  their 
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of 
their shoes be broken;

28 Whose  arrows  shall  be  sharp, 
and all their bows bent, and their 
horses’ hoofs shall be counted like 
flint, and their wheels like a whirl-
wind, their roaring like a lion.

29 They shall roar like young a li-
ons;  yea,  they  shall  roar,  and  lay 
hold  of  the  prey,  and  shall  carry 
away safe, and none shall deliver.
30 And in that a day they shall roar 
against them like the roaring of the

CHAPTER 16

Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s sins are 
forgiven—He  is  called  to  prophesy—
He  prophesies  of  the  rejection  by  the 
Jews of Christ’s teachings—A remnant 
will return—Compare Isaiah 6. About 
559–545 b.c.
a In the b year that king Uzziah died, 
I c saw also the Lord sitting upon a 
throne, high and lifted up, and his 
train filled the temple.

2 Above it stood the a seraphim; each  
one  had  six  wings;  with  twain  he 
covered  his  face,  and  with  twain  
he covered his feet, and with twain he  
did fly.

3 And one cried unto another, and 
said:  Holy,  holy,  holy,  is  the  Lord 
of Hosts; the whole earth is full of 
his a glory.

4 And the posts of the door moved 
at the voice of him that cried, and 
the house was filled with smoke.

5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for 
I am undone; because I am a man 
of unclean lips; and I dwell in the 
midst of a people of unclean lips; 
for mine eyes have a seen the King, 
the Lord of Hosts.

6 Then flew one of the seraphim 
unto me, having a live coal in his 
hand, which he had taken with the 
tongs from off the altar;

7 And he laid it upon my mouth, 
and said: Lo, this has touched thy 
lips;  and  thine  a iniquity  is  taken 
away, and thy sin purged.

8 Also  I  heard  the  voice  of  the 
Lord, saying:  a Whom shall I send, 
and who will go for us? Then I said: 
Here am I; send me.

9 And  he  said:  Go  and  tell  this 
people—Hear ye indeed, but they 
understood not; and see ye indeed, 
but they perceived not.

10 Make the heart of this people 
fat,  and  make  their  ears  heavy,  
and shut their eyes—lest they see 
with  their  eyes,  and  a hear  with  
their ears, and understand with their 
b heart,  and  be  converted  and  be  
healed.

11 Then  said  I:  Lord,  how  long? 
And  he  said:  Until  the  cities  be 
wasted without inhabitant, and the 
houses without man, and the land 
be utterly desolate;

12 And  the  Lord  have  a removed 
men  far  away,  for  there  shall  be 
a  great  forsaking  in  the  midst  of 
the land.

13 But yet there shall be a tenth, 
and they shall return, and shall be 
eaten, as a teil tree, and as an oak 
whose substance is in them when 
they cast their leaves; so the a holy 
seed shall be the substance thereof.

CHAPTER 17
Ephraim and Syria wage war against 
Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—
Compare Isaiah 7. About 559–545 b.c.
a And it came to pass in the days of 
b Ahaz the son of c Jotham, the son of 
Uzziah, king of Judah, that d Rezin, 
king of Syria, and e Pekah the son of 
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up 
toward  Jerusalem  to  war  against 
it, but could not prevail against it.
2 And  it  was  told  the  house  of 
David, saying: Syria is confederate 
with Ephraim. And his heart was 
moved, and the heart of his people, 
as the trees of the wood are moved 
with the wind.

3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah:

and Shearjashub thy son, at the end 
of the  a conduit of the upper pool 
in the highway of the fuller’s field;
4 And  say  unto  him:  Take  heed, 
and be quiet; fear not, neither be 
faint-hearted  for  the  two  tails  of 
these smoking firebrands, for the 
fierce  anger  of  Rezin  with  Syria, 
and of the son of Remaliah.

5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the 
son  of  Remaliah,  have  taken  evil 
counsel against thee, saying:

6 Let us go up against Judah and 
vex  it,  and  let  us  make  a  breach 
therein for us, and set a king in the 
midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal.
7 Thus saith the Lord God: a It shall 
not stand, neither shall it come to 
pass.

8 For the head of Syria is Damas-
cus,  and  the  head  of  Damascus, 
Rezin; and within threescore and 
five years shall Ephraim be a broken 
that it be not a people.

9 And  the  head  of  Ephraim  is 
Samaria, and the head of Samaria 
is  Remaliah’s  son.  If  ye  will  a not 
believe  surely  ye  shall  not  be  es-
tablished.

10 Moreover, the Lord spake again 

unto Ahaz, saying:

11 Ask thee a a sign of the Lord thy 
God; ask it either in the depths, or 
in the heights above.

12 But  Ahaz  said:  I  will  not  ask, 

neither will I a tempt the Lord.

13 And  he  said:  Hear  ye  now,  O 
house of David; is it a small thing 
for you to weary men, but will ye 
weary my God also?

14 Therefore, the Lord himself shall 
give you a sign—Behold, a a virgin  
shall conceive, and shall bear a son, 
and shall call his name b Immanuel.
15 Butter and a honey shall he eat, 
that he may know to refuse the evil 
and to choose the good.

16 For a before the child shall know 

to  refuse  the  evil  and  choose  the 
good, the land that thou abhorrest 
shall be forsaken of b both her kings.
17 The Lord shall a bring upon thee, 
and upon thy people, and upon thy 
father’s house, days that have not 
come from the day that b Ephraim 
departed from Judah, the king of 
Assyria.

18 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that  day  that  the  Lord  shall  hiss 
for the fly that is in the uttermost 
part of Egypt, and for the bee that 
is in the land of Assyria.

19 And they shall come, and shall 
rest all of them in the desolate val-
leys, and in the holes of the rocks, 
and upon all thorns, and upon all 
bushes.

20 In the same day shall the Lord 
shave  with  a  a razor  that  is  hired, 
by them beyond the river, by the 
king of Assyria, the head, and the 
hair  of  the  feet;  and  it  shall  also 
consume the beard.

21 And it shall come to pass in that 
day, a man shall nourish a young 
cow and two sheep;

22 And it shall come to pass, for 
the abundance of milk they shall 
give he shall eat butter; for butter 
and honey shall every one eat that 
is left in the land.

23 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that day, every place shall be, where 
there  were  a  thousand  vines  at  a 
thousand  silverlings,  which  shall 
be for briers and thorns.

24 With  arrows  and  with  bows 
shall  men  come  thither,  because 
all  the  land  shall  become  briers 
and thorns.

25 And all hills that shall be digged 
with  the  mattock,  there  shall  not 
come thither the fear of briers and 
thorns; but it shall be for the send-
ing forth of oxen, and the treading 
of lesser cattle.

CHAPTER 18

Christ will be as a stone of stumbling 
and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, 
not peeping wizards—Turn to the law 
and  to  the  testimony  for  guidance—
Compare Isaiah 8. About 559–545 b.c.

9  a Associate  yourselves,  O  ye  
people, and ye shall be broken in 
pieces;  and  give  ear  all  ye  of  far 
countries; gird yourselves, and ye 
shall be broken in pieces; gird your-
selves,  and  ye  shall  be  broken  in  
pieces.

Moreover,  the  word  of  the  Lord 
said unto me: Take thee a great a roll, 
and write in it with a man’s pen, 
concerning b Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
2 And  I  took  unto  me  faithful 
a witnesses  to  record,  Uriah  the 
priest,  and  Zechariah  the  son  of 
Jeberechiah.

3 And I went unto the prophetess; 
and she conceived and bare a son. 
Then said the Lord to me: a Call his 
name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4 For behold, a the child shall b not 
have knowledge to cry, My father, 
and my mother, before the riches 
of Damascus and the c spoil of d Sa-
maria shall be taken away before 
the king of e Assyria.

5 The  Lord  spake  also  unto  me 

again, saying:

6 Forasmuch as this people refus-
eth the waters of a Shiloah that go 
softly,  and  rejoice  in  b Rezin  and 
Remaliah’s son;

7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord 
bringeth up upon them the waters 
of the river, strong and many, even 
the king of a Assyria and all his glory; 
and he shall come up over all his 
channels, and go over all his banks.
8 And  he  shall  pass  through  Ju-
dah; he shall overflow and go over, 
he  shall  a reach  even  to  the  neck; 
and the stretching out of his wings 
shall fill the breadth of thy land, 
O Immanuel.

10 Take  counsel  together,  and  it 
shall  come  to  naught;  speak  the 
word,  and  it  shall  not  stand;  for 
God is with us.

11 For the Lord spake thus to me 
with a strong hand, and instructed 
me  that  I  should  not  walk  in  the 
way of this people, saying:

12 Say  ye  not,  A  confederacy,  to 
all to whom this people shall say, A 
a confederacy; neither fear ye their 
fear, nor be afraid.

13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts him-
self, and let him be your fear, and 
let him be your dread.

14 And he shall be for a sanctuary;  
but for a a stone of b stumbling, and 
for a  c rock of  d offense to both the 
houses of Israel, for a gin and a e snare  
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15 And  many  among  them  shall 
a stumble and fall, and be broken, 
and be snared, and be taken.

16 a Bind up the testimony, seal the 

law among my disciples.

17 And I will wait upon the Lord, 
that a hideth his face from the house 
of Jacob, and I will look for him.

18 Behold,  I  and  the  children 
whom the Lord hath given me are 
for  a signs  and  for  wonders  in  Is-
rael from the Lord of Hosts, which 
dwelleth in Mount Zion.

19 And when they shall say unto 
you:  Seek  unto  them  that  have  
a familiar spirits, and unto b wizards

that peep and mutter—c should not 
a  people  seek  unto  their  God  for 
the living to hear from the dead?
20 To  the  a law  and  to  the  testi-
mony;  and  if  they  speak  not  ac-
cording to this word, it is because 
there is no light in them.

21 And they shall pass through it 
hardly bestead and hungry; and it 
shall come to pass that when they 
shall  be  hungry,  they  shall  fret 
themselves,  and  curse  their  king 
and their God, and look upward.

22 And  they  shall  look  unto  the 
earth and behold trouble, and a dark-
ness, dimness of anguish, and shall 
be driven to darkness.

CHAPTER 19
Isaiah speaks messianically—The peo-
ple in darkness will see a great light—
Unto  us  a  child  is  born—He  will  be 
the Prince of Peace and will reign on 
David’s  throne—Compare  Isaiah  9. 
About 559–545 b.c.
a Nevertheless, the dimness shall 
not be such as was in her vexation, 
when at first he lightly afflicted the 
b land of c Zebulun, and the land of 
d Naphtali, and afterwards did more 
grievously afflict by the way of the 
Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee 
of the nations.

2 The people that walked in dark-
ness  have  seen  a  great  light;  they 
that dwell in the land of the shadow 
of death, upon them hath the light 
shined.

3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, 
and  a increased  the  joy—they  joy 
before thee according to the joy in 
harvest, and as men rejoice when 
they divide the spoil.

4 For thou hast broken the yoke 
of a his burden, and the staff of his 
shoulder, the rod of his b oppressor.
5 For every battle of the warrior is 
with confused noise, and garments 
rolled in blood; but  a this shall be 
with burning and fuel of fire.

6 For unto us a a child is born, unto 
us a son is given; and the b govern-
ment  shall  be  upon  his  shoulder; 
and his name shall be called, Won-
derful, Counselor, The c Mighty God, 
The d Everlasting Father, The Prince 
of e Peace.

7 Of the increase of a government 
and  peace  b there  is  no  end,  upon 
the throne of c David, and upon his 
kingdom to order it, and to estab-
lish it with judgment and with jus-
tice from henceforth, even forever. 
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will 
perform this.

8 The Lord sent his word unto Ja-
cob and it hath lighted upon Israel.
9 And all the people shall know, 
even Ephraim and the inhabitants 
of  Samaria,  that  say  in  the  pride 
and stoutness of heart:

10 The bricks are fallen down, but 
we  will  build  with  hewn  a stones; 
the  sycamores  are  cut  down,  but 
we will change them into b cedars.
11 Therefore the Lord shall set up 
the  adversaries  of  a Rezin  against 
him, and join his enemies together;
12 The Syrians before and the Phi-
listines behind; and they shall a de-
vour Israel with open mouth. For all 
this his b anger is not turned away, 
but his hand is stretched out still.
13 For the people turneth not unto 
a him that smiteth them, neither do 
they seek the Lord of Hosts.

14 Therefore will the Lord cut off

from Israel head and tail, branch 
and rush a in one day.

15 The  a ancient,  he  is  the  head; 
and the prophet that teacheth lies, 
he is the tail.

16 For the a leaders of this people 
cause them to err; and they that are 
b led of them are destroyed.

17 Therefore the Lord shall have 
no joy in their young men, neither 
shall have a mercy on their fatherless 
and b widows; for c every one of them 
is a hypocrite and an d evildoer, and 
every mouth speaketh e folly. For all 
this his anger is not turned away, 
but his f  hand is stretched out still.
18 For  a wickedness  burneth  as 
the fire; it shall devour the briers 
and thorns, and shall kindle in the 
thickets  of  the  forests,  and  they 
shall mount up like the lifting up 
of smoke.

19 Through the wrath of the Lord 
of Hosts is the a land darkened, and 
the people shall be as the fuel of the  
fire; b no man shall spare his brother.
20 And he a shall snatch on the right 
hand and be hungry; and he shall 
b eat on the left hand and they shall 
not be satisfied; they shall eat ev-
ery man the flesh of his own arm—
21 Manasseh,  a Ephraim;  and 
Ephraim, Manasseh; they together 
shall be against b Judah. For all this 
his anger is not turned away, but 
his hand is stretched out still.

CHAPTER 20

The  destruction  of  Assyria  is  a  type 
of the destruction of the wicked at the 
Second Coming—Few people will be left 

after the Lord comes again—The rem-
nant of Jacob will return in that day—
Compare Isaiah 10. About 559–545 b.c.
a Wo  unto  them  that  decree  b un-
righteous  decrees,  and  that  write  
grievousness which they have pre-
scribed;

2 To  turn  away  the  needy  from 
judgment,  and  to  take  away  the 
right from the a poor of my people, 
that b widows may be their prey, and 
that they may rob the fatherless!

3 And what will ye do in the day 
of visitation, and in the desolation 
which shall come from far? to whom 
will ye flee for help? and where will  
ye leave your glory ?

4 Without me they shall bow down 
under the prisoners, and they shall 
fall under the slain. For all this his 
anger is not turned away, but his 
hand is stretched out still.

5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine an-
ger, and the staff in their hand is 
a their indignation.

6 I will send him a against a hypo-
critical  nation,  and  against  the  
people of my wrath will I give him 
a  charge  to  take  the  spoil,  and  to 
take  the  prey,  and  to  tread  them 
down like the mire of the streets.
7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, nei-
ther doth his heart think so; but in 
his heart it is to destroy and cut off 
nations not a few.

8 For he saith: Are not my a princes 

altogether kings?

9 Is  not  a Calno  as  b Carchemish?

kingdoms of the idols, and whose 
graven  images  did  excel  them  of 
Jerusalem and of Samaria;

11 Shall I not, as I have done unto 
Samaria and her a idols, so do to Je-
rusalem and to her idols?

12 Wherefore it shall come to pass 
that when the Lord hath performed 
his whole work upon Mount Zion 
and upon Jerusalem, I will punish 
the fruit of the stout heart of the 
king of  a Assyria, and the glory of 
his high looks.

13 For  a he saith: By the strength 
of b my hand and by my wisdom I 
have  done  these  things;  for  I  am 
prudent; and I have moved the bor-
ders of the people, and have robbed 
their treasures, and I have put down 
the inhabitants like a valiant man;
14 And my hand hath found as a 
nest the riches of the people; and 
as one gathereth eggs that are left 
have I gathered all the earth; and 
there was none that moved the wing, 
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15 Shall the a ax boast itself against 
him that heweth therewith? Shall 
the saw magnify itself against him 
that shaketh it? As if the rod should 
shake itself against them that lift it 
up, or as if the staff should lift up 
itself as if it were no wood!

16 Therefore  shall  the  Lord,  the 
Lord of Hosts, send among his fat 
ones, leanness; and under his glory 
he shall kindle a burning like the 
burning of a fire.

17 And the light of Israel shall be for  
a a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, 
and shall burn and shall devour his 
thorns and his briers in one day;

18 And  shall  consume  the  glory 
of  his  forest,  and  of  his  fruitful 
field, both soul and body; and they 
shall be as when a standard-bearer  
fainteth.

19 And  the  a rest  of  the  trees  of 
his forest shall be few, that a child 
may write them.

20 And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that the remnant of Israel, and 
such as are escaped of the  a house 
of Jacob, shall no more again b stay 
upon  him  that  smote  them,  but 
shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy 
One of Israel, in truth.

21 The a remnant shall return, yea, 
even the remnant of Jacob, unto the 
mighty God.

22 For though thy people  a Israel 
be as the sand of the sea, yet a rem-
nant of them shall b return; the c con-
sumption  decreed  shall  overflow 
with righteousness.

23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall 
make a a consumption, even deter-
mined in all the land.

24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord 
God  of  Hosts:  O  my  people  that 
dwellest in Zion, a be not afraid of 
the  Assyrian;  he  shall  smite  thee 
with  a  rod,  and  shall  lift  up  his 
staff against thee, after the  b man-
ner of Egypt.

25 For yet a very little while, and 
the  a indignation  shall  cease,  and 
mine anger in their destruction.

26 And the Lord of Hosts shall a stir 
up a scourge for him according to 
the slaughter of b Midian at the rock 
of Oreb; and as his rod was upon 
the sea so shall he lift it up after 
the manner of c Egypt.

The  stem  of  Jesse  (Christ)  will  judge 
in  righteousness—The  knowledge  of 
God will cover the earth in the Millen-
nium—The Lord will raise an ensign 
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 11. 
About 559–545 b.c.

a And there shall b come forth a rod 
out  of  the  c stem  of  Jesse,  and  a 
d branch shall grow out of his roots.
2 And the a Spirit of the Lord shall 
rest  upon  him,  the  spirit  of  b wis-
dom and c understanding, the spirit 
of counsel and might, the spirit of 
knowledge  and  of  the  fear  of  the 
Lord;

3 And  shall  make  him  of  quick 
understanding  in  the  fear  of  the 
Lord; and he shall not a judge after 
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove 
after the hearing of his ears.

4 But with a righteousness shall he 
b judge the poor, and reprove with 
equity for the  c meek of the earth; 
and he shall d smite the earth with 
the e rod of his mouth, and with the  
breath of his lips shall he slay the 
wicked.

5 And a righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness 
the girdle of his reins.

6 The a wolf also shall dwell with 
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie 
down with the kid, and the calf and 
the young lion and fatling together; 
and a little child shall lead them.

7 And the cow and the bear shall

8 And the sucking child shall play

that day that the Lord shall set his 
hand again the a second time to re-
cover  the  remnant  of  his  people 
which shall be left, from b Assyria, 
and from Egypt, and from Pathros, 
and from Cush, and from Elam, and 
from  c Shinar,  and  from  Hamath,  
and from the islands of the sea.

12 And he shall set up an a ensign 
for the nations, and shall assemble 
the b outcasts of Israel, and c gather 
together  the  dispersed  of  Judah 
from the four corners of the earth.
13 The a envy of Ephraim also shall 
depart, and the adversaries of Judah 
shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not 
b envy c Judah, and Judah shall not 
vex Ephraim.

14 But  they  shall  fly  upon  the 
shoulders of the a Philistines towards 
the west; they shall spoil them of 
the  east  together;  they  shall  lay 
their hand upon b Edom and c Moab; 
and the children of Ammon shall 
obey them.

15 And the Lord shall utterly a de-
stroy  the  tongue  of  the  Egyptian 
sea;  and  with  his  mighty  wind 
he  shall  shake  his  hand  over  the  
river, and shall smite it in the seven 
streams, and make men go over b dry  
shod.

16 And there shall be a a highway 
for the remnant of his people which 
shall be left, from Assyria, like as 
it was to Israel in the day that he 
came up out of the land of Egypt.

CHAPTER 22
In the millennial day all men will praise 
the Lord—He will dwell among them—
Compare Isaiah 12. About 559–545 b.c.
a And  in  that  day  thou  shalt  say: 
O Lord, I will praise thee; though 
thou wast angry with me thine an-
ger is turned away, and thou com-
fortedst me.

2 Behold,  God  is  my  salvation;  I 
will  a trust,  and  not  be  afraid;  for 
the Lord b Jehovah is my c strength 
and my d song; he also has become 
my salvation.

3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw 
a water out of the wells of salvation.
4 And  in  that  day  shall  ye  say: 
a Praise the Lord, call upon his name, 
declare his doings among the peo-
ple, make mention that his name 
is exalted.

5 a Sing unto the Lord; for he hath 
done excellent things; this is known 
in all the earth.

6 a Cry out and shout, thou inhabi-
tant of Zion; for great is the Holy 
One of Israel in the midst of thee.

—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—
Compare Isaiah 13. About 559–545 b.c.

a The  burden  of  b Babylon,  which 
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

2 Lift  ye  up  a  banner  upon  the 
high mountain, exalt the voice unto 
them,  a shake  the  hand,  that  they 
may go into the gates of the nobles.
3 I have commanded my sanctified 
ones, I have also called my a mighty 
ones,  for  mine  anger  is  not  upon 
them that rejoice in my highness.
4 The  noise  of  the  multitude  in 
the  mountains  like  as  of  a  great 
people, a tumultuous noise of the 
a kingdoms of nations b gathered to-
gether, the Lord of Hosts mustereth 
the hosts of the battle.

5 They come from a far country, 
from  the  end  of  heaven,  yea,  the 
Lord, and the weapons of his indig-
nation, to destroy the whole land.
6 Howl ye, for the a day of the Lord 
is  at  hand;  it  shall  come  as  a  de-
struction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore  shall  all  hands  be 
faint, every man’s heart shall a melt;
8 And they shall be afraid; pangs 
and sorrows shall take hold of them; 
they shall be amazed one at another; 
their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold,  the  day  of  the  Lord 
cometh, cruel both with wrath and 
fierce anger, to lay the land deso-
late; and he shall a destroy the sin-
ners thereof out of it.

10 For  the  a stars  of  heaven  and 
the b constellations thereof shall not 
give their  c light; the  d sun shall be 
darkened  in  his  going  forth,  and 

the moon shall not cause her light 
to shine.

11 And  I  will  a punish  the  world 
for evil, and the b wicked for their 
iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy 
of the c proud to cease, and will lay  
down the haughtiness of the terrible.
12 I will make a a man more pre-
cious  than  fine  gold;  even  a  man 
than the golden wedge of Ophir.

13 Therefore,  I  will  a shake  the 
heavens,  and  the  earth  shall  b re-
move out of her place, in the wrath 
of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day 
of his fierce anger.

14 And it shall be as the chased roe, 
and as a sheep that no man taketh 
up; and they shall every man turn 
to his own people, and flee every 
one into his own a land.

15 Every one that is proud shall 
be thrust through; yea, and every 
one  that  is  a joined  to  the  wicked 
shall fall by the sword.

16 Their  a children  also  shall  be 
b dashed to pieces before their eyes; 
their  houses  shall  be  spoiled  and 
their wives ravished.

17 Behold, I will stir up the a Medes 
against  them,  which  shall  not  re-
gard silver and gold, nor shall they 
delight in it.

18 Their bows shall also dash the 
young men to pieces; and they shall 
have  no  a pity  on  the  fruit  of  the 
womb;  their  eyes  shall  not  spare 
children.

19 And a Babylon, the glory of king-
doms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ 
excellency,  shall  be  as  when  God 
overthrew b Sodom and Gomorrah.

20 It  shall  never  be  a inhabited, 
neither  shall  it  be  dwelt  in  from 
generation  to  generation:  neither 
shall the Arabian pitch tent there; 
neither shall the shepherds make 
their fold there.

21 But  a wild beasts of the desert 
shall  lie  there;  and  their  houses 
shall  be  full  of  doleful  creatures; 
and owls shall dwell there, and sa-
tyrs shall dance there.

22 And the wild beasts of the islands  
shall cry in their desolate houses, and 
dragons  in  their  pleasant  palaces; 
and her time is near to come, and 
her day shall not be prolonged. For I  
will  destroy  her  speedily;  yea,  for 
I will be merciful unto my people, 
but the wicked shall perish.

CHAPTER 24

Israel will be gathered and will enjoy 
millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out 
of heaven for rebellion—Israel will tri-
umph over Babylon (the world)—Com-
pare Isaiah 14. About 559–545 b.c.
a For the Lord will have mercy on 
Jacob, and will yet  b choose Israel, 
and set them in their own land; and 
the c strangers shall be joined with 
them, and they shall cleave to the 
house of Jacob.

2 And the people shall take them 
and bring them to their place; yea, 
from far unto the ends of the earth; 
and they shall return to their a lands 
of promise. And the house of Israel 
shall  b possess  them,  and  the  land 
of  the  Lord  shall  be  for  c servants 
and handmaids; and they shall take 
them captives unto whom they were 
captives; and they shall d rule over 
their oppressors.

3 And it shall come to pass in that 
day  that  the  Lord  shall  give  thee 
a rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy 
fear,  and  from  the  hard  bondage 
wherein thou wast made to serve.
4 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that  day,  that  thou  shalt  take  up 
this  proverb  a against  the  king  of 
b Babylon,  and  say:  How  hath  the 
oppressor  ceased,  the  golden  city  
ceased!

5 The Lord hath broken the staff 
of the a wicked, the scepters of the 
rulers.

6 a He  who  smote  the  people  in 
wrath with a continual stroke, he 
that ruled the nations in anger, is 
persecuted, and none hindereth.

7 The whole earth is at a rest, and is 
quiet; they break forth into b singing.
8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, 
and  also  the  cedars  of  Lebanon, 
saying: Since thou art laid down no 
feller is come up against us.

9 a Hell from beneath is moved for 
thee to meet thee at thy coming; it 
stirreth up the b dead for thee, even 
all  the  chief  ones  of  the  earth;  it 
hath raised up from their thrones 
all the kings of the nations.

10 All they shall speak and say unto 
thee:  Art  thou  also  become  weak  
as we? Art thou become like unto us?
11 Thy pomp is brought down to 
the grave; the noise of thy viols is 
not heard; the worm is spread un-
der thee, and the worms cover thee.
12  a How  art  thou  fallen  from 
heaven,  O  b Lucifer,  son  of  the

exalt my throne above the stars of 
God; I will sit also upon the mount 
of the congregation, in the sides of 
the north;

14 a I will ascend above the heights 
of  the  clouds;  I  will  be  like  the 
Most High.

15 Yet thou shalt be brought down 

to hell, to the sides of the a pit.

16 They  that  see  thee  shall  nar-
rowly  look  upon  thee,  and  shall 
consider thee, and shall say: Is this 
the  man  that  made  the  earth  to 
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?
17 And made the world as a wil-
derness,  and  destroyed  the  cities 
thereof, and opened not the house 
of his prisoners?

18 All the kings of the nations, yea, 
all of them, lie in glory, every one 
of them in his own house.

19 But  thou  art  cast  out  of  thy 
grave like an abominable branch, 
and the remnant of those that are 
slain, thrust through with a sword, 
that go down to the stones of the 
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
20 Thou shalt not be joined with 
them in burial, because thou hast 
destroyed  thy  land  and  slain  thy 
people;  the  a seed  of  b evil-doers  
shall never be renowned.

21 Prepare slaughter for his chil-
dren  for  the  a iniquities  of  their 
fathers, that they do not rise, nor 
possess  the  land,  nor  fill  the  face 
of the world with cities.

22 For I will rise up against them, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off 
from Babylon the a name, and rem-
nant, and son, and b nephew, saith 
the Lord.

23 I will also make it a a possession 
for the bittern, and pools of water; 
and I will sweep it with the besom of 
destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.
24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, 
saying: Surely as I have thought, so 

shall it come to pass; and as I have 
purposed, so shall it stand—

25 That I will bring the Assyrian in 
my land, and upon my mountains 
tread him under foot; then shall his 
a yoke  depart  from  off  them,  and 
his  burden  depart  from  off  their 
shoulders.

26 This is the purpose that is pur-
posed  upon  the  whole  earth;  and 
this  is  the  hand  that  is  stretched 
out upon all nations.

27 For the Lord of Hosts hath pur-
posed, and who shall disannul? And 
his hand is stretched out, and who 
shall turn it back?

28 In the year that king  a Ahaz died 

was this burden.

29 Rejoice not thou, whole Pales-
tina,  because  the  rod  of  him  that 
a smote  thee  is  broken;  for  out  of 
the serpent’s root shall come forth 
a cockatrice, and his b fruit shall be 
a c fiery flying serpent.

30 And the firstborn of the poor 
shall feed, and the needy shall lie 
down in safety; and I will kill thy 
root with famine, and he shall slay 
thy remnant.

31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, 
whole Palestina, art dissolved; for 
there shall come from the north a 
smoke, and none shall be alone in 
his appointed times.

32 What  shall  then  answer  the 
messengers  of  the  nations?  That  
the Lord hath founded a Zion, and 
the b poor of his people shall trust 
in it.

Messiah—He will first come six hundred 
years  after  Lehi  left  Jerusalem—The 
Nephites  keep  the  law  of  Moses  and 
believe in Christ, who is the Holy One 
of Israel. About 559–545 b.c.

Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat 
concerning the words which I have 
written,  which  have  been  spoken 
by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, 
Isaiah  spake  many  things  which 
were a hard for many of my people 
to understand; for they know not 
concerning the manner of prophe-
sying among the Jews.

2 For  I,  Nephi,  have  not  taught 
them many things concerning the 
manner of the Jews; for their a works 
were works of darkness, and their 
doings were doings of abominations.
3 Wherefore, I write unto my peo-
ple, unto all those that shall receive 
hereafter these things which I write, 
a that they may know the judgments 
of God, that they come upon all na-
tions, according to the word which 
he hath spoken.

4 Wherefore, hearken, O my peo-
ple, which are of the house of Is-
rael, and give ear unto my words; 
for because the words of Isaiah are 
not  plain  unto  you,  nevertheless 
they are plain unto all those that 
are filled with the a spirit of b proph-
ecy. But I give unto you a c prophecy, 
according to the spirit which is in 
me; wherefore I shall prophesy ac-
cording to the d plainness which hath 
been with me from the time that I 
came out from Jerusalem with my 
father; for behold, my soul delight-
eth in e plainness unto my people, 
that they may learn.

5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in 

the words of a Isaiah, for I came out 
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath 
beheld the things of the b Jews, and 
I know that the Jews do c understand 
the things of the prophets, and there 
is  none  other  people  that  under-
stand the things which were spoken 
unto the Jews like unto them, save 
it be that they are taught after the 
manner of the things of the Jews.

6 But  behold,  I,  Nephi,  have  not 
taught my children after the man-
ner  of  the  Jews;  but  behold,  I,  of 
myself,  have  dwelt  at  Jerusalem, 
wherefore I know concerning the 
regions  round  about;  and  I  have 
made  mention  unto  my  children 
concerning the judgments of God, 
which a hath come to pass among the 
Jews, unto my children, according 
to all that which Isaiah hath spo-
ken, and I do not write them.

7 But behold, I proceed with mine 
own  prophecy,  according  to  my 
a plainness;  in  the  which  I  b know 
that no man can err; nevertheless, 
in the days that the prophecies of 
Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall 
know of a surety, at the times when 
they shall come to pass.

8 Wherefore,  they  are  of  a worth 
unto the children of men, and he 
that  supposeth  that  they  are  not, 
unto them will I speak particularly, 
and confine the words unto mine 
b own people; for I know that they 
shall be of great worth unto them in 
the c last days; for in that day shall 
they understand them; wherefore, 
for their good have I written them.
9 And  as  one  generation  hath 
been a destroyed among the Jews be-
cause of iniquity, even so have they 
been destroyed from generation to

them been destroyed save it were 
b foretold them by the prophets of  
the Lord.

10 Wherefore,  it  hath  been  told 
them  concerning  the  destruction 
which should come upon them, im-

salem; nevertheless, they b hardened 
their hearts; and according to my 
prophecy they have been destroyed,

gotten of the Father, yea, even the 
Father of heaven and of earth, shall 
c manifest himself unto them in the 
flesh, behold, they will reject him, 
because of their iniquities, and the 
hardness  of  their  hearts,  and  the 
stiffness of their necks.

13 Behold, they will a crucify him; 
and after he is laid in a b sepulchre 
for the space of c three days he shall 
d rise from the dead, with healing in 
his wings; and all those who shall 
believe on his name shall be saved 

in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, 
my soul delighteth to prophesy con-
cerning  him,  for  I  have  e seen  his 
day,  and  my  heart  doth  magnify 
his holy name.

14 And  behold  it  shall  come  to 
pass  that  after  the  a Messiah  hath 
risen  from  the  dead,  and  hath 
mani fested  himself  unto  his  peo-
ple, unto as many as will believe on 
his name, behold, Jerusalem shall 
be  b destroyed again; for  c wo unto 
them  that  fight  against  God  and 
the people of his d church.

15 Wherefore, the  a Jews shall be 
b scattered among all nations; yea, 
and  also  c Babylon  shall  be  de-
stroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be  
scattered by other nations.

16 And  after  they  have  been 
a scattered, and the Lord God hath 
scourged  them  by  other  nations 
for the space of many generations, 
yea, even down from generation to 
genera tion until they shall be per-
suaded to b believe in Christ, the Son 
of God, and the atonement, which 
is  infinite  for  all  mankind—and 
when that day shall come that they 
shall believe in Christ, and worship 
the Father in his name, with pure 
hearts and c clean hands, and look 
not forward any more for d another 
Messiah, then, at that time, the day 
will come that it must needs be ex-
pedient  that  they  should  believe 
these things.

again the second time to a restore his 
people  from  their  lost  and  fallen 
state. Wherefore, he will proceed to 
do a b marvelous work and a wonder 
among the children of men.

18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth 
a his b words unto them, which words 
shall  c judge  them  at  the  last  day, 
for  they  shall  be  given  them  for 
the purpose of d convincing them of 
the true Messiah, who was rejected 
by them; and unto the convincing 
of  them  that  they  need  not  look 
forward  any  more  for  a  Messiah  
to come, for there should not any 
come,  save  it  should  be  a  e false 
Messiah  which  should  deceive 
the  people;  for  there  is  save  one  
f   Messiah spoken of by the prophets, 
and that Messiah is he who should 
be rejected of the Jews.

19 For according to the words of 
the prophets, the a Messiah cometh 
in  b six  hundred  years  from  the 
time that my father left Jerusalem; 
and according to the words of the 
prophets, and also the word of the 
c angel  of  God,  his  d name  shall  be 
Jesus Christ, the e Son of God.

20 And now, my brethren, I have 
spoken plainly that ye cannot err. 
And  as  the  Lord  God  liveth  that 
a brought Israel up out of the land of 
Egypt, and gave unto Moses power 
that  he  should  b heal  the  nations  

after they had been bitten by the 
poisonous serpents, if they would 
cast  their  eyes  unto  the  c serpent 
which he did raise up before them, 
and  also  gave  him  power  that  he 
should smite the d rock and the wa-
ter should come forth; yea, behold 
I say unto you, that as these things 
are e true, and as the Lord God liv-
eth, there is none other f name given 
under heaven save it be this Jesus 
Christ,  of  which  I  have  spoken, 
whereby man can be saved.

21 Wherefore, for this cause hath 
the  Lord  God  promised  unto  me 
that  these  things  which  I  a write 
shall  be  kept  and  preserved,  and 
handed down unto my seed, from 
generation to generation, that the 
promise may be fulfilled unto Jo-
seph,  that  his  seed  should  never 
b perish as long as the earth should  
stand.

22 Wherefore,  these  things  shall 
go  from  generation  to  generation 
as long as the earth shall stand; and 
they shall go according to the will 
and  pleasure  of  God;  and  the  na-
tions who shall possess them shall 
be a judged of them according to the 
words which are written.

23 For we labor diligently to write, 
to a persuade our children, and also 
our brethren, to believe in Christ, 
and to be reconciled to God; for we

know that it is by b grace that we are 
saved, after all we can c do.

24 And,  notwithstanding  we  be-
lieve  in  Christ,  we  a keep  the  law 
of  Moses,  and  look  forward  with 
steadfastness unto Christ, until the 
law shall be fulfilled.

25 For, for this end was the  a law 
given; wherefore the law hath be-
come  b dead  unto  us,  and  we  are 
made alive in Christ because of our 
faith; yet we keep the law because 
of the commandments.

26 And we a talk of Christ, we re-
joice in Christ, we preach of Christ, 
we b prophesy of Christ, and we write 
according  to  our  prophecies,  that 
our  c children  may  know  to  what 
source they may look for a d remis-
sion of their sins.

27 Wherefore, we speak concern-
ing the law that our children may 
know the deadness of the law; and 
they, by knowing the deadness of 
the law, may look forward unto that 
life which is in Christ, and know for 
what end the law was given. And 
after the law is fulfilled in Christ, 
that  they  need  not  harden  their 
hearts  against  him  when  the  law 
ought to be done away.

28 And now behold, my people, ye 
are a a stiffnecked people; wherefore, 
I have spoken plainly unto you, that 
ye cannot misunderstand. And the 
words  which  I  have  spoken  shall 
stand as a b testimony against you; 
for they are sufficient to c teach any 
man  the  d right  way;  for  the  right 
way is to believe in Christ and deny 
him not; for by denying him ye also 
deny the prophets and the law.

29 And now behold, I say unto you 
that the right way is to believe in 
Christ, and deny him not; and Christ 
is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore 
ye must bow down before him, and 
a worship him with all your b might, 
mind, and strength, and your whole 
soul; and if ye do this ye shall in 
nowise be cast out.

30 And,  inasmuch  as  it  shall  be 
expedient, ye must keep the a per-
formances and b ordinances of God 
until the law shall be fulfilled which 
was given unto Moses.

CHAPTER 26

Christ will minister to the Nephites—
Nephi  foresees  the  destruction  of  his 
people —They  will  speak  from  the 
dust—The Gentiles will build up false 
churches and secret combinations—The 
Lord forbids men to practice priestcrafts. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And after Christ shall have  a risen 
from the dead he shall b show him-
self unto you, my children, and my 
beloved  brethren;  and  the  words 
which he shall speak unto you shall 
be the c law which ye shall do.

2 For behold, I say unto you that I 
have beheld that many generations 
shall pass away, and there shall be 
great wars and contentions among 
my people.

3 And after the Messiah shall come 
there shall be a signs given unto my 
people of his b birth, and also of his 
c death and resurrection; and great 
and terrible shall that day be unto 
the  wicked,  for  they  shall  perish; 
and they perish because they cast

out  the  d prophets,  and  the  saints, 
and  stone  them,  and  slay  them; 
wherefore the cry of the e blood of 
the saints shall ascend up to God 
from the ground against them.

4 Wherefore,  all  those  who  are 
proud,  and  that  do  wickedly,  the 
day that cometh shall a burn them 
up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they 
shall be as stubble.

5 And they that kill the a prophets, 
and  the  saints,  the  depths  of  the 
earth shall b swallow them up, saith 
the Lord of Hosts; and c mountains 
shall cover them, and whirlwinds 
shall carry them away, and build-
ings shall fall upon them and crush 
them to pieces and grind them to 
powder.

6 And they shall be visited with 
thunderings,  and  lightnings,  and 
earthquakes, and all manner of de-
structions, for the a fire of the anger 
of the Lord shall be kindled against 
them, and they shall be as stubble, 
and the day that cometh shall con-
sume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
7 a O  the  pain,  and  the  anguish  
of my soul for the loss of the slain of  
my people! For I, Nephi, have seen 
it, and it well nigh consumeth me 
before  the  presence  of  the  Lord; 
but I must cry unto my God: Thy 
ways are b just.

8 But  behold,  the  righteous  that 
hearken unto the words of the proph-
ets, and destroy them not, but look  
forward unto Christ with a steadfast-

ness for the signs which are given, 
notwithstanding all b persecution—
behold, they are they which shall 
c not perish.

9 But  the  Son  of  Righteousness  
shall  a appear  unto  them;  and  he 
shall b heal them, and they shall have 
c peace with him, until d three genera-
tions  shall  have  passed  away,  and 
many of the e fourth generation shall 
have passed away in righteousness.
10 And  when  these  things  have 
passed  away  a  speedy  a destruc-
tion  cometh  unto  my  people;  for, 
notwithstanding  the  pains  of  my 
soul,  I  have  seen  it;  wherefore,  I 
know that it shall come to pass; and 
they sell themselves for naught; for, 
for the reward of their pride and 
their  b foolishness  they  shall  reap 
destruction; for because they yield 
unto the devil and c choose works of 
d darkness rather than light, there-
fore they must go down to e hell.

11 For the Spirit of the Lord will 
not always  a strive with man. And 
when the Spirit  b ceaseth to strive 
with man then cometh speedy de-
struction,  and  this  grieveth  my  
soul.

12 And as I spake concerning the 
a convincing of the b Jews, that Jesus 
is  the  c very  Christ,  it  must  needs 
be that the Gentiles be convinced 
also  that  Jesus  is  the  Christ,  the 
d Eternal e God;

him,  by  the  power  of  the  b Holy 
Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kin-
dred, tongue, and people, working 
mighty  c miracles, signs, and won-
ders,  among  the  children  of  men 
according to their d faith.

14 But  behold,  I  prophesy  unto 
you concerning the a last days; con-
cerning  the  days  when  the  Lord 
God shall b bring these things forth 
unto the children of men.

15 After my seed and the seed of 
my brethren shall have a dwindled 
in  unbelief,  and  shall  have  been 
smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after 
the Lord God shall have  b camped 
against them round about, and shall 
have laid siege against them with 
a  mount,  and  raised  forts  against 
them; and after they shall have been 
brought down low in the dust, even 
that they are not, yet the words of 
the righteous shall be written, and 
the  c prayers  of  the  faithful  shall 
be heard, and all those who have 
d dwindled in unbelief shall not be 
forgotten.

16 For those who shall be destroyed  
shall  a speak unto them out of the 
ground, and their speech shall be 
low out of the dust, and their voice 
shall be as one that hath a famil-
iar  spirit;  for  the  Lord  God  will 
give unto him power, that he may 
whisper concerning them, even as 
it were out of the ground; and their 
speech shall whisper out of the dust.

17 For  thus  saith  the  Lord  God: 
They shall a write the things which 
shall  be  done  among  them,  and  
they  shall  be  written  and  b sealed 
up in a book, and those who have  
dwindled  in  c unbelief  shall  not  
have them, for they d seek to destroy 
the things of God.

18 Wherefore, as those who have 
been destroyed have been destroyed 
speedily; and the multitude of their 
a terrible ones shall be as b chaff that 
passeth away—yea, thus saith the 
Lord God: It shall be at an instant, 
suddenly—

19 And it shall come to pass, that 
those who have dwindled in unbe-
lief shall be a smitten by the hand 
of the Gentiles.

20 And the Gentiles are lifted up 
in the a pride of their eyes, and have 
b stumbled, because of the greatness 
of their c stumbling block, that they 
have built up many d churches; nev-
ertheless, they e put down the power 
and miracles of God, and preach up 
unto themselves their own wisdom 
and their own f  learning, that they 
may get gain and g grind upon the 
face of the poor.

21 And there are many churches 
built  up  which  cause  a envyings, 
and b strifes, and c malice.

22 And there are also secret a com-
binations, even as in times of old,

all  these  things;  yea,  the  founder 
of murder, and c works of darkness; 
yea,  and  he  leadeth  them  by  the 
neck with a flaxen cord, until he 
bindeth them with his strong cords  
forever.

23 For behold, my beloved breth-
ren,  I  say  unto  you  that  the  Lord 
God worketh not in a darkness.

24 He doeth not a anything save it 
be for the benefit of the world; for  
he b loveth the world, even that he  
layeth down his own life that he may  
draw c all men unto him. Wherefore, 
he  commandeth  none  that  they 
shall not partake of his salvation.

25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, 
saying:  Depart  from  me?  Behold, 
I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: 
a Come unto me all ye b ends of the 
earth, c buy milk and honey, without 
money and without price.

26 Behold,  hath  he  commanded 
any that they should a depart out of 
the synagogues, or out of the houses 
of worship? Behold, I say unto you,  
Nay.

27 Hath he commanded any that 
they should not partake of his a sal-
vation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; 
but  he  hath  b given  it  free  for  all 
men; and he hath commanded his 
people that they should persuade 
all men to c repentance.

28 Behold,  hath  the  Lord  com-
manded any that they should not 
partake of his goodness? Behold I  
say unto you, Nay; but a all men are  
privileged  the  one  b like  unto  the 
other, and none are forbidden.

29 He  commandeth  that  there 
shall be no a priestcrafts; for, behold, 
priestcrafts  are  that  men  preach 
and set  b themselves up for a light 
unto the world, that they may get 
c gain and d praise of the world; but 
they seek not the e welfare of Zion.
30 Behold, the Lord hath forbid-
den this thing; wherefore, the Lord 
God  hath  given  a  commandment 
that all men should have a charity, 
which b charity is c love. And except 
they should have charity they were 
nothing. Wherefore, if they should 
have charity they would not suffer 
the laborer in Zion to perish.

31 But the a laborer in b Zion shall 
labor for Zion; for if they labor for 
c money they shall perish.

32 And again, the Lord God hath 
a commanded that men should not 
murder;  that  they  should  not  lie; 
that they should not b steal; that they 
should not take the name of the Lord  
their God in c vain; that they should 
not d envy; that they should not have 
e malice; that they should not con-
tend  one  with  another;  that  they 
should  not  commit  f whoredoms; 
and  that  they  should  do  none  of 
these things; for whoso doeth them 
shall perish.

33 For  none  of  these  iniquities 
come of the Lord; for he doeth that 
which is good among the children of 
men; and he doeth nothing save it 
be plain unto the children of men; 
and he a inviteth them b all to c come 
unto him and partake of his good-
ness; and he d denieth none that come

unto him, black and white, e bond

remembereth the f  heathen; and all 
are alike unto God, both Jew and 
Gentile.

CHAPTER 27
Darkness and apostasy will cover the 
earth in the last days—The Book of Mor-
mon will come forth—Three witnesses 
will testify of the book—The learned man 
will say he cannot read the sealed book—
The  Lord  will  do  a  marvelous  work 
and  a  wonder—Compare  Isaiah  29.  
About 559–545 b.c.
But, behold, in the a last days, or in 
the days of the Gentiles—yea, be-
hold all the nations of the Gentiles 
and also the Jews, both those who 
shall come upon this land and those 
who shall be upon other lands, yea, 
even upon all the lands of the earth, 
behold, they will be b drunken with 
iniquity and all manner of abomi-
nations—

2 And when that day shall come 
they shall be a visited of the Lord of 
Hosts, with thunder and with earth-
quake, and with a great noise, and  
with storm, and with tempest, and 
with the b flame of devouring fire.
3 And all the a nations that b fight 
against Zion, and that distress her, 
shall be as a dream of a night vision;  
yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto  
a hungry man which dreameth, and 
behold  he  eateth  but  he  awak eth 
and his soul is empty; or like unto 
a thirsty man which dreameth, and 
behold he drinketh but he awak eth 
and behold he is faint, and his soul 

hath appetite; yea, even so shall the 
multitude of all the nations be that 
fight against Mount Zion.

4 For behold, all ye that doeth in-
iquity, stay yourselves and wonder, 
for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye  
shall be a drunken but not with wine,  
ye shall stagger but not with strong 
drink.

5 For behold, the Lord hath poured 
out  upon  you  the  spirit  of  deep 
sleep.  For  behold,  ye  have  closed 
your a eyes, and ye have b rejected the  
prophets; and your rulers, and the 
seers  hath  he  covered  because  of 
your iniquity.

6 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
the Lord God shall bring forth unto 
a you the words of a b book, and they 
shall be the words of them which 
have slumbered.

7 And  behold  the  book  shall  be  
a sealed; and in the book shall be a 
b revelation from God, from the be-
ginning of the world to the c ending 
thereof.

8 Wherefore, because of the things 
which  are  a sealed  up,  the  things 
which are sealed shall not be deliv-
ered in the day of the wickedness 
and  abominations  of  the  people. 
Wherefore the book shall be kept 
from them.

9 But the book shall be delivered 
unto  a  man,  and  he  shall  deliver  
the words of the book, which are the  
words of those who have slumbered 
in  the  dust,  and  he  shall  deliver 
these words unto a another;

10 But the words which are a sealed 
he shall not deliver, neither shall he 
deliver the book. For the book shall

be sealed by the power of God, and 
the  revelation  which  was  sealed 
shall be kept in the book until the 
own due time of the Lord, that they 
may come forth; for behold, they b re-
veal all things from the foundation 
of the world unto the end thereof.
11 And  the  day  cometh  that  the 
words of the book which were sealed  
shall be read upon the house tops; 
and they shall be read by the power 
of  Christ;  and  all  things  shall  be 
a revealed unto the children of men 
which  ever  have  been  among  the 
children of men, and which ever will 
be even unto the end of the earth.
12 Wherefore,  at  that  day  when 
the book shall be delivered unto the  
man  of  whom  I  have  spoken,  the 
book shall be hid from the eyes of 
the world, that the eyes of none shall 
behold it save it be that a three b wit-
nesses shall behold it, by the power 
of God, besides him to whom the 
book shall be delivered; and they 
shall testify to the truth of the book 
and the things therein.

13 And there is a none other which 
shall view it, save it be a few accord-
ing to the will of God, to bear testi-
mony of his word unto the children 
of men; for the Lord God hath said 
that the words of the faithful should 
speak as if it were b from the dead.
14 Wherefore, the Lord God will 
proceed  to  bring  forth  the  words 
of the book; and in the mouth of 
as many witnesses as seemeth him 
good will he establish his word; and 
wo be unto him that a rejecteth the 
word of God!

15 But  behold,  it  shall  come  to 
pass  that  the  Lord  God  shall  say 
unto him to whom he shall deliver 

the book: Take these words which 
are not sealed and deliver them to 
another,  that  he  may  show  them 
unto the learned, saying: a Read this, 
I pray thee. And the learned shall 
say:  Bring  hither  the  book,  and  I 
will read them.

16 And now, because of the glory 
of the world and to get  a gain will 
they say this, and not for the glory 
of God.

17 And the man shall say: I can-
not bring the book, for it is sealed.
18 Then  shall  the  learned  say:  I 

cannot read it.

19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, 
that the Lord God will a deliver again 
the book and the words thereof to 
him  that  is  not  learned;  and  the 
man that is not learned shall say: 
I am not learned.

20 Then  shall  the  Lord  God  say 
unto him: The learned shall not read  
them, for they have rejected them, 
and I am a able to do mine own work; 
wherefore thou shalt read the words 
which I shall give unto thee.

21 a Touch not the things which are 
sealed, for I will bring them forth in 
mine own due time; for I will show 
unto the children of men that I am 
able to do mine own work.

22 Wherefore, when thou hast read 
the words which I have commanded 
thee, and obtained the  a witnesses 
which I have promised unto thee, 
then  shalt  thou  seal  up  the  book 
again, and hide it up unto me, that 
I  may  preserve  the  words  which 
thou hast not read, until I shall see 
fit in mine own b wisdom to c reveal 
all things unto the children of men.

unto the b world that I am the same 
yesterday, today, and forever; and I 
c work not among the children of men  
save it be d according to their faith.
24 And again it shall come to pass 
that  the  Lord  shall  say  unto  him 
that shall read the words that shall 
be delivered him:

25 a Forasmuch as this people draw 
near  unto  me  with  their  mouth, 
and with their lips do  b honor me, 
but have removed their c hearts far 
from me, and their fear towards me 
is taught by the d precepts of men—
26 Therefore, I will proceed to do  
a  a marvelous  work  among  this  
people, yea, a b marvelous work and 
a wonder, for the c wisdom of their  
wise  and  d learned  shall  perish,  
and  the  e understanding  of  their 
f prudent shall be hid.

27 And  a wo unto them that seek 
deep to hide their b counsel from the 
Lord!  And  their  works  are  in  the 
c dark; and they say: Who seeth us, 
and who knoweth us? And they also 
say: Surely, your turning of things 
upside down shall be esteemed as 
the d potter’s clay. But behold, I will 
show unto them, saith the Lord of 
Hosts, that I e know all their works. 
For shall the work say of him that 
made it, he made me not? Or shall 
the  thing  framed  say  of  him  that 
framed it, he had no understanding?
28 But  behold,  saith  the  Lord  of 
Hosts: I will show unto the children 
of  men  that  it  is  yet  a  very  little 
while and Lebanon shall be turned 
into a fruitful field; and the a fruitful 
field shall be esteemed as a forest.
29 a And in that day shall the b deaf 

hear  the  words  of  the  book,  and 
the eyes of the blind shall see out 
of obscurity and out of darkness.

30 And  the  a meek  also  shall  in-
crease, and their b joy shall be in the 
Lord, and the poor among men shall 
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

31 For assuredly as the Lord liv-
eth they shall see that the a terrible 
one is brought to naught, and the 
scorner is consumed, and all that 
watch for iniquity are cut off;

32 And they that make a man an 
a offender for a word, and lay a snare 
for him that reproveth in the b gate, 
and c turn aside the just for a thing 
of naught.

33 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, 
who redeemed Abraham, concern-
ing the house of Jacob: Jacob shall 
a not now be ashamed, neither shall 
his face now wax pale.

34 But when he a seeth his children, 
the work of my hands, in the midst 
of him, they shall sanctify my name, 
and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, 
and shall fear the God of Israel.

35 They  also  that  a erred  in  spirit 
shall come to understanding, and they  
that murmured shall b learn doctrine.

as the Spirit hath constrained me; 
wherefore, I know that they must 
surely come to pass.

2 And the things which shall be 
written out of the a book shall be of 
great  b worth unto the children of 
men, and especially unto our seed, 
which  is  a  c remnant  of  the  house 
of Israel.

3 For it shall come to pass in that 
day that the a churches which are built 
up, and not unto the Lord, when the 
one shall say unto the other: Behold, 
I, I am the Lord’s; and the others shall 
say: I, I am the Lord’s; and thus shall 
every  one  say  that  hath  built  up 
b churches, and not unto the Lord—
4 And they shall contend one with 
another; and their priests shall con-
tend  one  with  another,  and  they 
shall  teach  with  their  a learning, 
and  deny  the  b Holy  Ghost,  which 
giveth utterance.

5 And  they  a deny  the  b power  of 
God,  the  Holy  One  of  Israel;  and 
they say unto the people: Hearken 
unto us, and hear ye our precept; 
for behold there is c no God today, 
for the Lord and the Redeemer hath 
done his work, and he hath given 
his power unto men;

6 Behold,  hearken  ye  unto  my 
precept; if they shall say there is a 
miracle wrought by the hand of the 
Lord, believe it not; for this day he 
is not a God of a miracles; he hath 
done his work.

7 Yea,  and  there  shall  be  many 
which shall say: a Eat, drink, and be 
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it 
shall be well with us.

8 And  there  shall  also  be  many 
which shall say: a Eat, drink, and be 
b merry; nevertheless, fear God—he 
will c justify in committing a little 
d sin; yea, e lie a little, take the advan-
tage  of  one  because  of  his  words, 
dig a f pit for thy neighbor; there is 
g no harm in this; and do all these 
things, for tomorrow we die; and if 
it so be that we are guilty, God will 
beat us with a few stripes, and at 
last we shall be saved in the king-
dom of God.

9 Yea,  and  there  shall  be  many 
which shall teach after this manner, 
a false  and  vain  and  b foolish  c doc-
trines,  and  shall  be  puffed  up  in 
their hearts, and shall seek deep to 
hide their counsels from the Lord; 
and their works shall be in the dark.
10 And the a blood of the saints shall  
cry from the ground against them.
11 Yea, they have all gone out of the  
a way; they have become b corrupted.
12 Because of a pride, and because 
of  b false  teachers,  and  c false  doc-
trine, their churches have become 
corrupted, and their churches are 
lifted up; because of pride they are 
puffed up.

13 They a rob the b poor because of 
their fine sanctuaries; they rob the 
poor because of their fine clothing;

and they persecute the meek and 
the poor in heart, because in their 
c pride they are puffed up.

14 They wear a stiff necks and high 
heads;  yea,  and  because  of  pride, 
and wickedness, and abominations, 
and  b whoredoms,  they  have  all 
c gone astray save it be a d few, who 
are the humble followers of Christ; 
nevertheless, they are e led, that in 
many instances they do f err because 
they  are  taught  by  the  precepts  
of men.

15 O  the  a wise,  and  the  learned, 
and the rich, that are puffed up in 
the b pride of their c hearts, and all 
those who preach d false doctrines, 
and all those who commit e whore-
doms, and pervert the right way of 
the Lord, f wo, wo, wo be unto them, 
saith  the  Lord  God  Almighty,  for 
they shall be thrust down to hell!

16 Wo unto them that a turn aside 
the just for a thing of naught and 
b revile against that which is good, 
and say that it is of no worth! For 
the  day  shall  come  that  the  Lord 
God will speedily visit the inhabi-
tants of the earth; and in that day 
that they are c fully ripe in iniquity 
they shall perish.

17 But behold, if the inhabitants 
of  the  earth  shall  repent  of  their 
wickedness and abominations they 
shall  not  be  destroyed,  saith  the 
Lord of Hosts.

18 But  behold,  that  great  and 
a abominable  church,  the  b whore 
of  all  the  earth,  must  c tumble  to 

the  earth,  and  great  must  be  the 
fall thereof.

19 For  the  kingdom  of  the  devil 
must a shake, and they which belong 
to it must needs be stirred up unto 
repentance, or the b devil will grasp 
them with his everlasting c chains, 
and  they  be  stirred  up  to  anger, 
and perish;

20 For behold, at that day shall he 
a rage in the b hearts of the children 
of men, and stir them up to anger 
against that which is good.

21 And others will he a pacify, and 
lull them away into carnal  b secu-
rity, that they will say: All is well 
in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is 
well—and thus the c devil d cheateth 
their souls, and leadeth them away 
carefully down to hell.

22 And behold, others he a flattereth 
away, and telleth them there is no 
b hell; and he saith unto them: I am 
no devil, for there is none—and thus  
he whispereth in their ears, until he  
grasps them with his awful c chains, 
from whence there is no deliverance.
23 Yea,  they  are  grasped  with 
death,  and  hell;  and  death,  and 
hell,  and  the  devil,  and  all  that 
have  been  seized  therewith  must 
stand  before  the  throne  of  God, 
and be a judged according to their 
works, from whence they must go 
into the place prepared for them, 
even a b lake of fire and brimstone, 
which is endless torment.

24 Therefore, wo be unto him that 

is at a ease in Zion!

25 Wo  be  unto  him  that  crieth: 

All is well!

26 Yea, wo be unto him that a heark-
eneth unto the precepts of men, and 
denieth the power of God, and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost!

27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: 
We  have  received,  and  we  a need 
no more!

28 And in fine, wo unto all those 
who tremble, and are a angry because 
of b the truth of God! For behold, he 
that is built upon the c rock d receiv-
eth  it  with  gladness;  and  he  that 
is  built  upon  a  sandy  foundation 
trembleth lest he shall fall.

29 Wo be unto him that shall say: 
We have received the word of God, 
and we a need b no more of the word 
of God, for we have enough!

30 For behold, thus saith the Lord 
God: I will give unto the children of 
men line upon line, a precept upon 
precept,  here  a  little  and  there  a 
little;  and  blessed  are  those  who 
heark en unto my precepts, and lend 
an  ear  unto  my  counsel,  for  they 
shall learn b wisdom; for unto him 
that c receiveth I will give d more; and 
from them that shall say, We have 
enough, from them shall be taken 
away even that which they have.

31 Cursed  is  he  that  putteth  his 
a trust in man, or maketh flesh his 
arm, or shall hearken unto the b pre-
cepts  of  men,  save  their  precepts 
shall be given by the power of the 
Holy Ghost.

32 a Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith 
the Lord God of Hosts! For notwith-

standing I shall lengthen out mine 
arm  unto  them  from  day  to  day, 
they will deny me; nevertheless, I 
will be merciful unto them, saith 
the  Lord  God,  if  they  will  repent 
and b come unto me; for mine c arm 
is lengthened out all the day long, 
saith the Lord God of Hosts.

CHAPTER 29
Many Gentiles will reject the Book of 
Mormon—They will say, We need no 
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many 
nations—He will judge the world out of 
the books which will be written. About 
559–545 b.c.
But behold, there shall be many—
at that day when I shall proceed to 
do a a marvelous work among them, 
that I may remember my b covenants 
which I have made unto the chil-
dren of men, that I may set my hand 
again the  c second time to recover 
my people, which are of the house 
of Israel;

2 And also, that I may remember 
the  promises  which  I  have  made 
unto  thee,  Nephi,  and  also  unto 
thy father, that I would remember  
your  seed;  and  that  the  a words  
of your seed should proceed forth 
out of my mouth unto your seed; 
and  my  words  shall  b hiss  forth 
unto  the  c ends  of  the  earth,  for  a  
d standard  unto  my  people,  which 
are of the house of Israel;

3 And because my words shall hiss 
forth—many of the Gentiles shall 
say:  A  a Bible!  A  Bible!  We  have

got  a  Bible,  and  there  cannot  be 
any more Bible.

4 But thus saith the Lord God: O  
fools, they shall have a a Bible; and  
it shall proceed forth from the b Jews, 
mine ancient covenant people. And 
what c thank they the d Jews for the 
Bible which they receive from them?  
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do  
they remember the travails, and the 
labors, and the pains of the Jews, and 
their diligence unto me, in bringing  
forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered 
the  Jews,  mine  ancient  covenant 
people?  Nay;  but  ye  have  a cursed  
them, and have  b hated them, and 
have not sought to recover them. But  
behold, I will return all these things 
upon your own heads; for I the Lord 
have not forgotten my people.

6 Thou fool, that shall say: A a Bible, 
we have got a Bible, and we need 
no  more  Bible.  Have  ye  obtained 
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

7 Know ye not that there are more 
a nations  than  one?  Know  ye  not 
that I, the Lord your God, have cre-
ated all men, and that I remember 
those who are upon the b isles of the 
sea; and that I rule in the heavens 
above  and  in  the  c earth  beneath; 
and I bring forth my d word unto the 
children of men, yea, even upon all 
the nations of the earth?

8 Wherefore murmur ye, because 
that  ye  shall  receive  more  of  my 
word? Know ye not that the a testi-

mony of b two nations is a c witness 
unto you that I am God, that I re-
member one d nation like unto an-
other? Wherefore, I speak the same 
words  unto  one  nation  like  unto 
another. And when the two e nations 
shall run together the testimony of 
the two nations shall run together  
also.

9 And I do this that I may prove 
unto many that I am the a same yes-
terday, today, and forever; and that 
I speak forth my b words according 
to  mine  own  pleasure.  And  be-
cause that I have spoken one c word 
ye need not suppose that I cannot 
speak another; for my d work is not 
yet finished; neither shall it be until 
the end of man, neither from that 
time henceforth and forever.

10 Wherefore, because that ye have 
a  Bible  ye  need  not  suppose  that 
it contains all my  a words; neither 
b need  ye  suppose  that  I  have  not 
caused more to be written.

11 For I command a all men, both 
in the east and in the west, and in  
the  north,  and  in  the  south,  and  
in the islands of the sea, that they 
shall b write the words which I speak 
unto  them;  for  out  of  the  c books 
which shall be written I will d judge 
the world, every man according to 
their works, according to that which 
is written.

12 For behold, I shall speak unto 
the  a Jews  and  they  shall  b write 
it; and I shall also speak unto the

Nephites  and  they  shall  c write  it; 
and  I  shall  also  speak  unto  the 
other tribes of the house of Israel, 
which  I  have  led  away,  and  they 
shall write it; and I shall also speak 
unto  d all nations of the earth and 
they shall write it.

13 And it shall come to pass that 
the  a Jews shall have the words of 
the Nephites, and the Nephites shall 
have the words of the Jews; and the 
Nephites  and  the  Jews  shall  have 
the words of the  b lost tribes of Is-
rael;  and  the  lost  tribes  of  Israel 
shall have the words of the Neph-
ites and the Jews.

14 And it shall come to pass that my 
people, which are of the a house of 
Israel, shall be gathered home unto 
the b lands of their possessions; and 
my word also shall be gathered in 
c one. And I will show unto them that 
fight against my word and against 
my d people, who are of the e house  
of Israel, that I am God, and that I  
f covenanted  with  g Abraham  that  
I would remember his h seed i forever.

CHAPTER 30
Converted  Gentiles  will  be  numbered 
with  the  covenant  people—Many  La-
manites and Jews will believe the word 
and  become  delightsome—Israel  will 
be restored and the wicked destroyed. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now behold, my beloved breth-
ren,  I  would  speak  unto  you;  for 
I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye 

should  suppose  that  ye  are  more 
righteous  than  the  Gentiles  shall 
be. For behold, except ye shall keep 
the commandments of God ye shall 
all likewise a perish; and because of 
the words which have been spoken 
ye need not suppose that the Gen-
tiles are utterly destroyed.

2 For behold, I say unto you that 
as many of the Gentiles as will re-
pent  are  the  a covenant  people  of 
the Lord; and as many of the b Jews 
as will not repent shall be c cast off; 
for the Lord d covenanteth with none 
save  it  be  with  them  that  e repent 
and believe in his Son, who is the 
Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, I would prophesy some-
what more concerning the Jews and 
the Gentiles. For after the book of 
which  I  have  spoken  shall  come 
forth, and be written unto the Gen-
tiles, and sealed up again unto the 
Lord,  there  shall  be  many  which 
shall a believe the words which are 
written; and b they shall carry them 
forth unto the c remnant of our seed.
4 And then shall the remnant of 
our seed know concerning us, how 
that we came out from Jerusalem, 
and  that  they  are  descendants  of 
the Jews.

5 And  the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ 
shall  be  declared  among  a them; 
wherefore, b they shall be restored 
unto the c knowledge of their fathers, 
and also to the knowledge of Jesus 
Christ, which was had among their 
fathers.

6 And then shall they rejoice; for 
they shall a know that it is a blessing 
unto them from the hand of God; 
and their b scales of darkness shall 
begin to fall from their eyes; and 
many  generations  shall  not  pass 
away among them, save they shall 
be a pure and a c delightsome people.
7 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
the a Jews which are scattered also 
shall b begin to believe in Christ; and 
they shall begin to gather in upon 
the face of the land; and as many 
as shall believe in Christ shall also 
become a delightsome people.

8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
the Lord God shall commence his 
work among all nations, kindreds, 
tongues, and people, to bring about 
the a restoration of his people upon 
the earth.

9 And with righteousness shall the 
a Lord God b judge the poor, and re-
prove with equity for the c meek of 
the earth. And he shall smite the 
earth with the rod of his mouth; and 
with the breath of his lips shall he 
slay the wicked.

10 For the a time speedily cometh 
that  the  Lord  God  shall  cause  a 
great  b division among the people, 
and the wicked will he c destroy; and 
he will d spare his people, yea, even 
if it so be that he must e destroy the 
wicked by fire.

11 And a righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness 
the girdle of his reins.

12 a And then shall the wolf dwell 
with  the  lamb;  and  the  leopard 
shall  lie  down  with  the  kid,  and 

the  calf,  and  the  young  lion,  and 
the  fatling,  together;  and  a  little 
child shall lead them.

13 And the cow and the bear shall 
feed;  their  young  ones  shall  lie 
down together; and the lion shall 
eat straw like the ox.

14 And  the  sucking  child  shall 
play on the hole of the asp, and the 
weaned child shall put his hand on 
the cockatrice’s den.

15 They shall not hurt nor destroy 
in all my holy  a mountain; for the 
earth  shall  be  full  of  the  b knowl-
edge of the Lord as the waters cover 
the sea.

16 Wherefore,  the  things  of  a all 
nations shall be made known; yea, 
all  things  shall  be  made  b known 
unto the children of men.

17 There is nothing which is secret 
save it shall be  a revealed; there is  
no work of darkness save it shall be  
made manifest in the light; and there 
is  nothing  which  is  sealed  upon  
the earth save it shall be loosed.

18 Wherefore,  all  things  which 
have been revealed unto the chil-
dren of men shall at that  a day be 
revealed; and Satan shall have power 
over the hearts of the children of 
men b no more, for a long time. And 
now, my beloved brethren, I make 
an end of my sayings.

baptism are the gate to the strait and 
narrow  path—Eternal  life  comes  to 
those who keep the commandments after 
baptism. About 559–545 b.c.

And now I, Nephi, make an end of 
my a prophesying unto you, my be-
loved brethren. And I cannot write 
but a few things, which I know must 
surely come to pass; neither can I 
write but a few of the b words of my 
brother Jacob.

2 Wherefore,  the  things  which  I 
have written sufficeth me, save it 
be a few words which I a must speak 
concerning the doctrine of Christ; 
wherefore, I shall speak unto you 
plainly, according to the plainness 
of my prophesying.

3 For my soul delighteth in a plain-
ness; for after this manner doth the 
Lord God work among the children 
of  men.  For  the  Lord  God  giveth 
light unto the b understanding; for 
he  speaketh  unto  men  according 
to  their  c language,  unto  their  un-
derstanding.

4 Wherefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should remember that I have spoken 
unto you concerning that a prophet 
which  the  Lord  showed  unto  me, 
that  should  baptize  the  b Lamb  of 
God, which should take away the 
sins of the world.

5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he 
being  a holy,  should  have  need  to 
be b baptized by water, to fulfil all 
righteousness,  O  then,  how  much 
more need have we, being unholy, 
to be c baptized, yea, even by water!
6 And now, I would ask of you, my 
beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb 

of God did fulfil all righteousness 
in being baptized by water?

7 Know ye not that he was holy ? 
But notwithstanding he being holy, 
he  showeth  unto  the  children  of 
men that, according to the flesh he 
humbleth himself before the Father, 
and witnesseth unto the Father that 
he would be a obedient unto him in 
keeping his commandments.

8 Wherefore, after he was baptized 
with water the Holy Ghost descended  
upon him in the a form of a b dove.

9 And again, it showeth unto the 
children of men the straitness of the 
path, and the narrowness of the a gate, 
by which they should enter, he hav-
ing set the b example before them.

10 And he said unto the children 
of  men:  a Follow  thou  me.  Where-
fore, my beloved brethren, can we 
b follow Jesus save we shall be will-
ing to keep the commandments of 
the Father?

11 And the Father said: Repent ye, 
repent ye, and be baptized in the 
name of my Beloved Son.

12 And also, the voice of the Son 
came  unto  me,  saying:  He  that  is 
baptized in my name, to him will 
the  Father  a give  the  Holy  Ghost, 
like  unto  me;  wherefore,  b follow 
me,  and  do  the  things  which  ye 
have seen me do.

13 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, I know that if ye shall a follow 
the Son, with full purpose of heart, 
acting  no  b hypocrisy  and  no  de-
ception before God, but with real 
c intent, repenting of your sins, wit-
nessing unto the Father that ye are 
d willing to take upon you the e name

of Christ, by f  baptism—yea, by fol-
lowing your Lord and your Savior 
down into the water, according to his 
word, behold, then shall ye receive 
the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh 
the g baptism of fire and of the Holy 
Ghost; and then can ye speak with 
the  h tongue  of  angels,  and  shout  
praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
14 But, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, thus came the voice of the Son 
unto me, saying: After ye have re-
pented of your sins, and witnessed 
unto the Father that ye are willing 
to keep my commandments, by the 
baptism of water, and have received 
the baptism of fire and of the Holy 
Ghost, and can speak with a new 
tongue, yea, even with the tongue of 
angels, and after this should a deny 
me, it would have been b better for 
you that ye had not known me.

15 And I heard a voice from the 
Father,  saying: Yea, the  a words  of 
my Beloved are true and faithful. 
He that b endureth to the c end, the 
same shall be saved.

16 And now, my beloved brethren, 
I  know  by  this  that  unless  a  man 
shall a endure to the end, in follow-
ing the b example of the Son of the 
living God, he cannot be saved.

17 Wherefore, do the things which 
I have told you I have seen that your 
Lord and your Redeemer should do; 
for, for this cause have they been 
shown unto me, that ye might know 

the gate by which ye should enter. 
For  the  gate  by  which  ye  should 
enter  is  repentance  and  a baptism 
by  water;  and  then  cometh  a  b re-
mission of your sins by fire and by 
the Holy Ghost.

18 And then are ye in this a strait 
and  narrow  b path  which  leads  to 
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in 
by the gate; ye have done according 
to the commandments of the Father 
and the Son; and ye have received 
the Holy Ghost, which c witnesses of 
the  d Father and the Son, unto the 
fulfilling of the promise which he 
hath made, that if ye entered in by 
the way ye should receive.

19 And now, my beloved brethren, 
after ye have gotten into this strait 
and narrow a path, I would ask if all 
is  b done?  Behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
Nay; for ye have not come thus far 
save it were by the word of Christ 
with unshaken c faith in him, d rely-
ing wholly upon the merits of him 
who is mighty to e save.

20 Wherefore, ye must press for-
ward with a a steadfastness in Christ, 
having  a  perfect  brightness  of  
b hope, and a c love of God and of all 
men.  Wherefore,  if  ye  shall  press 
forward,  feasting  upon  the  word 
of Christ, and d endure to the end, 
behold,  thus  saith  the  Father:  Ye 
shall have e eternal life.

is b none other way nor c name given

Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which 
is f one God, without end. Amen.

CHAPTER 32

Angels speak by the power of the Holy 
Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowl-
edge for themselves from the Holy Ghost. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I suppose that ye ponder some-
what in your hearts concerning that 
which ye should do after ye have 
entered in by the way. But, behold, 
why do ye ponder these things in 
your hearts?

2 Do ye not remember that I said 
unto you that after ye had a received 
the Holy Ghost ye could speak with 
the b tongue of angels? And now, how 
could ye speak with the tongue of  
angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
3 a Angels  speak  by  the  power  of 
the  Holy  Ghost;  wherefore,  they 
speak the words of Christ. Where-
fore,  I  said  unto  you,  b feast  upon  
the c words of Christ; for behold, the  
words  of  Christ  will  d tell  you  all 
things what ye should do.

4 Wherefore,  now  after  I  have 
spoken  these  words,  if  ye  cannot  
understand them it will be because 
ye  a ask  not,  neither  do  ye  knock; 
wherefore, ye are not brought into 

the  light,  but  must  perish  in  the 
dark.

5 For behold, again I say unto you 
that if ye will enter in by the way, 
and receive the Holy Ghost, it will 
a show unto you all things what ye 
should do.

6 Behold,  this  is  the  doctrine  of 
Christ, and there will be no more 
doctrine given until after he shall 
a manifest himself unto you in the 
flesh. And when he shall manifest 
himself unto you in the flesh, the 
things which he shall say unto you 
shall ye observe to do.

7 And  now  I,  Nephi,  cannot  say 
more;  the  Spirit  stoppeth  mine 
utterance, and I am left to mourn 
because  of  the  a unbelief,  and  the 
wickedness, and the ignorance, and 
the b stiffneckedness of men; for they 
will  c not  search  d knowledge,  nor 
understand great knowledge, when 
it is given unto them in e plainness, 
even as plain as word can be.

8 And now, my beloved brethren, I 
perceive that ye ponder still in your 
hearts; and it grieveth me that I must 
speak concerning this thing. For if 
ye would hearken unto the a Spirit 
which teacheth a man to b pray, ye 
would know that ye must c pray; for 
the d evil spirit teacheth not a man 
to pray, but teacheth him that he 
must not pray.

9 But behold, I say unto you that 
ye must a pray always, and not faint; 
that ye must not perform any thing 
unto the Lord save in the first place 
ye  shall  b pray  unto  the  Father  in

the  c name  of  Christ,  that  he  will 
d consecrate thy performance unto 
thee, that thy performance may be 
for the e welfare of thy soul.

CHAPTER 33

Nephi’s  words  are  true—They  testify 
of Christ—Those who believe in Christ 
will believe Nephi’s words, which will 
stand as a witness before the judgment 
bar. About 559–545 b.c.
And now I, Nephi, cannot write all 
the things which were taught among 
my  people;  neither  am  I  a mighty 
in  writing,  like  unto  speaking; 
for when a man  b speaketh by the 
power of the Holy Ghost the power 
of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto 
the hearts of the children of men.
2 But  behold,  there  are  many 
that  a harden their  b hearts against 
the  c Holy  Spirit,  that  it  hath  no 
place in them; wherefore, they cast 
many things away which are writ-
ten and esteem them as things of  
naught.

3 But I, Nephi, have written what 
I have written, and I esteem it as of 
great  a worth,  and  especially  unto 
my people. For I b pray continually 
for  them  by  day,  and  mine  c eyes 
water my pillow by night, because 
of them; and I cry unto my God in 
faith, and I know that he will hear 
my cry.

4 And I know that the Lord God 
will consecrate my prayers for the 

gain of my people. And the words 
which I have written in weakness 
will be made strong unto them; for 
it a persuadeth them to do good; it 
maketh known unto them of their 
fathers;  and  it  speaketh  of  Jesus, 
and  persuadeth  them  to  believe 
in him, and to endure to the end, 
which is life b eternal.

5 And it speaketh a harshly against 
sin, according to the b plainness of 
the truth; wherefore, no man will 
be angry at the words which I have 
written save he shall be of the spirit 
of the devil.

6 I a glory in b plainness; I glory in 
truth;  I  glory  in  my  Jesus,  for  he 
hath c redeemed my soul from hell.
7 I  have  a charity  for  my  people, 
and  great  faith  in  Christ  that  I 
shall meet many souls spotless at 
his judgment-seat.

8 I  have  charity  for  the  a Jew—I 
say Jew, because I mean them from 
whence I came.

9 I also have charity for the Gen-
tiles. But behold, for none of a these 
can I hope except they shall be b rec-
onciled unto Christ, and enter into 
the c narrow d gate, and e walk in the 
f strait path which leads to life, and 
continue in the path until the end 
of the day of g probation.

10 And now, my beloved brethren, 
and also a Jew, and all ye ends of the 
earth, hearken unto these words and 
b believe in Christ; and if ye believe 
not in these words believe in Christ.

And if ye shall c believe in Christ ye  
will believe in these d words, for they 
are the e words of Christ, and he hath 
given them unto me; and they f teach  
all men that they should do good.
11 And if they are not the words 
of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will  
show  unto  you,  with  a power  and 
great b glory, that they are his words, 
at the last day; and you and I shall 
stand face to face before his bar; and 
ye shall know that I have been com-
manded of him to write these things, 
notwithstanding my weakness.

12 And  I  pray  the  Father  in  the 
name of Christ that many of us, if 
not all, may be saved in his a king-
dom at that great and last day.

13 And now, my beloved brethren, 

all  those  who  are  of  the  house  of  
Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, 
I speak unto you as the voice of one 
a crying from the dust: Farewell un-
til that great day shall come.

14 And you that will not partake 
of the goodness of God, and respect 
the words of the a Jews, and also my 
b words, and the words which shall 
proceed forth out of the mouth of 
the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you 
an  everlasting  farewell,  for  these 
words  shall  c condemn  you  at  the 
last day.

15 For what I seal on earth, shall 
be brought against you at the a judg-
ment  bar;  for  thus  hath  the  Lord 
commanded me, and I must b obey. 
Amen.

The words of his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a man who 
seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ. A few words concerning the his-
tory of the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 1

Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men 
to believe in Christ and keep His com-
mandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness 
prevails  among  the  Nephites.  About 
544–421 b.c.

FOR  behold,  it  came  to  pass 

that  fifty  and  five  years  had  
passed  away  from  the  time 
that  Lehi  left  Jerusalem;  where-
fore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a a com-

mandment  concerning  the  b small 
plates, upon which these things are  
engraven.

2 And he gave me, Jacob, a com-
mandment that I should a write upon 
b these  plates  a  few  of  the  things 
which  I  considered  to  be  most  
precious;  that  I  should  not  touch, 
save it were lightly, concerning the 
history  of  this  people  which  are 
called the people of Nephi.

people should be engraven upon his  
a other plates, and that I should b pre-
serve these plates and hand them 
down unto my seed, from generation  
to generation.

4 And  if  there  were  preaching 
which  was  a sacred,  or  revelation 
which  was  great,  or  prophesying,  
that I should engraven the b heads of 
them upon these plates, and touch 
upon them as much as it were pos-
sible, for Christ’s sake, and for the 
sake of our people.

5 For  because  of  faith  and  great 
anxiety,  it  truly  had  been  made 
manifest  unto  us  concerning  our 
people,  what  things  should  a hap-
pen unto them.

6 And we also had many revelations, 
and  the  spirit  of  much  prophecy;  
wherefore, we knew of a Christ and 
his kingdom, which should come.

7 Wherefore we labored diligently 
among our people, that we might 
persuade them to a come unto Christ, 
and partake of the goodness of God, 
that they might enter into his b rest, 
lest by any means he should swear 
in his wrath they should not c enter 
in, as in the d provocation in the days 
of temptation while the children of  
Israel were in the e wilderness.

8 Wherefore, we would to God that 
we could persuade all men a not to 
rebel against God, to b provoke him 
to anger, but that all men would be-
lieve in Christ, and view his death, 
and suffer his  c cross and bear the 
shame  of  the  world;  wherefore,  I,  

Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the  
commandment of my brother Nephi.
9 Now  Nephi  began  to  be  old, 
and he saw that he must soon a die; 
wherefore, he b anointed a man to be 
a king and a ruler over his people  
now, according to the reigns of the 
c kings.

10 The people having loved Nephi 
exceedingly, he having been a great 
protector for them, having wielded 
the a sword of Laban in their defence, 
and having labored in all his days 
for their welfare—

11 Wherefore, the people were de-
sirous to retain in remembrance his 
name. And whoso should reign in 
his stead were called by the people, 
second Nephi, third Nephi, and so 
forth, according to the reigns of the 
kings; and thus they were called by 
the people, let them be of whatever 
name they would.

12 And it came to pass that Nephi 

died.

13 Now the people which were not 
a Lamanites  were  Nephites;  never-
theless, they were called Nephites, 
Jacobites,  Josephites,  b Zoramites, 
Lamanites,  Lemuelites,  and  Ish-
maelites.

14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter 
distinguish a them by these names, 
but  I  shall  b call  them  Lamanites 
that seek to destroy the people of 
Nephi, and those who are friendly 
to Nephi I shall call  c Nephites, or 
the d people of Nephi, according to 
the reigns of the kings.

JACOB 1  : 15–2  : 7

15 And now it came to pass that 
the people of Nephi, under the reign 
of the second king, began to grow 
hard  in  their  hearts,  and  indulge 
themselves  somewhat  in  wicked 
practices, such as like unto David of 
old desiring many a wives and b con-
cubines, and also Solomon, his son.
16 Yea,  and  they  also  began  to 
search much a gold and silver, and 
began  to  be  lifted  up  somewhat 
in pride.

17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto 
them these words as I taught them 
in the a temple, having first obtained 
mine b errand from the Lord.

18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Jo-
seph had been a consecrated priests 
and b teachers of this people, by the 
hand of Nephi.

19 And we did a magnify our office 
unto the Lord, taking upon us the 
b responsibility, answering the sins 
of the people upon our own heads if 
we did not c teach them the word of 
God with all diligence; wherefore, 
by  laboring  with  our  might  their 
d blood  might  not  come  upon  our 
garments;  otherwise  their  blood 
would  come  upon  our  garments, 
and we would not be found spot-
less at the last day.

CHAPTER 2
Jacob  denounces  the  love  of  riches, 
pride, and unchastity—Men may seek 
riches  to  help  their  fellowmen—The 
Lord  commands  that  no  man  among 
the Nephites may have more than one 
wife—The Lord delights in the chastity 
of women. About 544–421 b.c.

The  a words  which  Jacob,  the 
brother  of  Nephi,  spake  unto  the 
people  of  Nephi,  after  the  death  
of Nephi:

2 Now,  my  beloved  brethren,  I, 
Jacob, according to the  a responsi-
bility which I am under to God, to 
b magnify mine office with c sober-
ness, and that I might d rid my gar-
ments of your sins, I come up into 
the  temple  this  day  that  I  might 
declare unto you the word of God.
3 And ye yourselves know that I 
have hitherto been diligent in the 
office of my calling; but I this day 
am weighed down with much more 
desire and anxiety for the a welfare  
of your souls than I have hitherto 
been.

4 For behold, as yet, ye have been 
obedient unto the word of the Lord, 
which I have given unto you.

5 But  behold,  hearken  ye  unto 
me, and know that by the help of 
the all-powerful Creator of heaven 
and earth I can tell you concerning 
your a thoughts, how that ye are be-
ginning to labor in sin, which sin 
appeareth  very  abominable  unto 
me, yea, and abominable unto God.
6 Yea,  it  grieveth  my  soul  and 
causeth me to shrink with shame 
before the presence of my Maker, 
that I must testify unto you concern-
ing the wickedness of your hearts.
7 And  also  it  grieveth  me  that 
I  must  use  so  much  a boldness  of 
speech concerning you, before your 
wives and your children, many of 
whose  feelings  are  exceedingly 
tender  and  b chaste  and  delicate

before God, which thing is pleas-
ing unto God;

8 And it supposeth me that they 
have  come  up  hither  to  hear  the 
pleasing a word of God, yea, the word 
which healeth the wounded soul.

9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul 
that  I  should  be  constrained,  be-
cause of the strict commandment 
which I have received from God, to 
a admonish  you  according  to  your 
crimes,  to  enlarge  the  wounds  of 
those who are already wounded, in-
stead of consoling and healing their 
wounds;  and  those  who  have  not 
been wounded, instead of feasting 
upon the pleasing word of God have 
daggers placed to pierce their souls 
and wound their delicate minds.

10 But, notwithstanding the great-
ness of the task, I must do according 
to the strict a commands of God, and 
tell you concerning your wickedness 
and abominations, in the presence 
of the pure in heart, and the broken 
heart, and under the glance of the 
b piercing eye of the Almighty God.
11 Wherefore, I must tell you the 
truth  according  to  the  a plainness 
of the b word of God. For behold, as 
I inquired of the Lord, thus came 
the  word  unto  me,  saying:  Jacob, 
get thou up into the temple on the 
morrow, and declare the word which 
I shall give thee unto this people.

12 And now behold, my brethren, 
this is the word which I declare unto  
you, that many of you have begun 
to search for gold, and for silver, and 
for all manner of precious a ores, in 
the which this land, which is a b land 

of  promise  unto  you  and  to  your 
seed, doth abound most plentifully.
13 And  the  hand  of  providence 
hath smiled upon you most pleas-
ingly, that you have obtained many 
riches; and because some of you have 
obtained more abundantly than that 
of your brethren ye are a lifted up in 
the pride of your hearts, and wear 
stiff necks and high heads because 
of  the  costliness  of  your  apparel, 
and  persecute  your  brethren  be-
cause ye suppose that ye are better  
than they.

14 And now, my brethren, do ye 
suppose that God justifieth you in 
this thing? Behold, I say unto you, 
Nay. But he condemneth you, and if 
ye persist in these things his judg-
ments must speedily come unto you.
15 O that he would show you that 
he  can  pierce  you,  and  with  one 
glance of his a eye he can smite you 
to the dust!

16 O that he would rid you from 
this iniquity and abomination. And, 
O  that  ye  would  listen  unto  the 
word of his commands, and let not 
this  a pride of your hearts destroy 
your souls!

17 Think  of  your  a brethren  like 
unto  yourselves,  and  be  familiar 
with  all  and  free  with  your  b sub-
stance, that c they may be rich like 
unto you.

18 But a before ye seek for b riches, 

seek ye for the c kingdom of God.

19 And after ye have obtained a 
hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, 
if  ye  seek  them;  and  ye  will  seek 
them for the intent to  a do good—

JACOB 2  : 20–33

to clothe the naked, and to feed the 
hungry, and to liberate the captive, 
and  administer  relief  to  the  sick 
and the afflicted.

20 And now, my brethren, I have 
spoken unto you concerning pride; 
and  those  of  you  which  have  af-
flicted  your  neighbor,  and  perse-
cuted him because ye were proud in 
your hearts, of the things which God 
hath given you, what say ye of it?

21 Do  ye  not  suppose  that  such 
things  are  abominable  unto  him 
who created all flesh? And the one 
being is as precious in his sight as 
the  other.  And  all  flesh  is  of  the 
dust; and for the selfsame end hath 
he created them, that they should 
keep his a commandments and glo-
rify him forever.

22 And  now  I  make  an  end  of 
speaking unto you concerning this 
pride. And were it not that I must 
speak unto you concerning a grosser 
crime, my heart would rejoice ex-
ceedingly because of you.

23 But the word of God burdens 
me because of your grosser crimes. 
For behold, thus saith the Lord: This  
people begin to wax in iniquity; they  
understand not the scriptures, for 
they seek to excuse themselves in 
committing a whoredoms, because of  
the things which were written con-
cerning David, and Solomon his son.
24 Behold,  David  and  a Solomon 
truly had many b wives and concu-
bines, which thing was c abominable 
before me, saith the Lord.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, 
I have led this people forth out of 
the land of Jerusalem, by the power 
of mine arm, that I might raise up 

unto me a a righteous branch from 
the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will 
not suffer that this people shall do 
like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear 
me,  and  hearken  to  the  word  of 
the  Lord:  For  there  shall  not  any 
a man  among  you  have  save  it  be 
b one c wife; and concubines he shall  
have none;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in 
the a chastity of women. And b whore-
doms  are  an  abomination  before 
me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore,  this  people  shall 
keep my commandments, saith the 
Lord of Hosts, or a cursed be the land 
for their sakes.

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of 
Hosts, raise up a seed unto me, I will 
command  my  people;  otherwise 
they shall hearken unto these things.
31 For  behold,  I,  the  Lord,  have 
seen  the  sorrow,  and  heard  the 
mourning of the daughters of my 
people  in  the  land  of  Jerusalem, 
yea, and in all the lands of my peo-
ple, because of the wickedness and 
a abominations of their b husbands.
32 And I will not suffer, saith the 
Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the 
fair daughters of this people, which 
I have led out of the land of Jerusa-
lem, shall come up unto me against 
the  men  of  my  people,  saith  the 
Lord of Hosts.

33 For  they  shall  not  lead  away 
captive the daughters of my people 
because of their tenderness, save I 
shall visit them with a sore curse, 
even  unto  destruction;  for  they 
shall not commit a whoredoms, like

unto  them  of  old,  saith  the  Lord  
of Hosts.

34 And now behold, my brethren, 
ye know that these commandments 
were  given  to  our  a father,  Lehi; 
wherefore, ye have known them be-
fore; and ye have come unto great 
condemnation;  for  ye  have  done 
these  things  which  ye  ought  not 
to have done.

35 Behold, ye have done a greater 
iniquities than the Lamanites, our 
brethren. Ye have broken the hearts 
of your tender wives, and lost the 
confidence  of  your  children,  be-
cause of your bad examples before 
them;  and  the  sobbings  of  their 
hearts  ascend  up  to  God  against 
you. And because of the b strictness 
of the word of God, which cometh 
down against you, many hearts died, 
pierced with deep wounds.

CHAPTER 3

The pure in heart receive the pleasing 
word of God—Lamanite righteousness 
exceeds  that  of  the  Nephites—Jacob 
warns against fornication, lascivious-
ness, and every sin. About 544–421 b.c.

But behold, I, Jacob, would speak 
unto  you  that  are  pure  in  heart. 
Look  unto  God  with  firmness  of 
mind, and a pray unto him with ex-
ceeding faith, and he will b console 
you in your c afflictions, and he will 
plead your cause, and send down 
d justice upon those who seek your 
destruction.

2 O all ye that are pure in heart, 
lift up your heads and receive the 
pleasing  word  of  God,  and  feast 

upon his a love; for ye may, if your 
b minds are c firm, forever.

3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are 
not  pure  in  heart,  that  are  filthy 
this day before God; for except ye 
repent the land is a cursed for your 
sakes;  and  the  Lamanites,  which 
are not b filthy like unto you, nev-
ertheless  they  are  c cursed  with  a 
sore cursing, shall scourge you even 
unto destruction.

4 And the time speedily cometh, 
that except ye repent they shall pos-
sess the land of your inheritance, 
and the Lord God will a lead away 
the righteous out from among you.
5 Behold,  the  Lamanites  your 
brethren,  whom  ye  hate  because 
of their filthiness and the cursing 
which hath come upon their skins,  
are more righteous than you; for they 
have not a forgotten the command-
ment of the Lord, which was given 
unto our father—that they should 
have  save  it  were  b one  wife,  and  
c concubines they should have none, 
and there should not be d whoredoms 
committed among them.

6 And  now,  this  commandment 
they  observe  to  keep;  wherefore, 
because of this observance, in keep-
ing  this  commandment,  the  Lord 
God will not destroy them, but will 
be  a merciful  unto  them;  and  one 
day  they  shall  b become  a  blessed  
people.

7 Behold,  their  a husbands  b love  
their c wives, and their wives love their 
husbands; and their husbands and  
their  wives  love  their  children;  
and their d unbelief and their hatred  
towards  you  is  because  of  the  in-
iquity of their fathers; wherefore,

JACOB 3  : 8–4  : 3

how much better are you than they, 
in the sight of your great Creator?
8 O my brethren, I fear that unless 
ye shall repent of your sins that their 
skins  will  be  a whiter  than  yours, 
when ye shall be brought with them 
before the throne of God.

9 Wherefore,  a  commandment  I 
give  unto  you,  which  is  the  word 
of  God,  that  ye  a revile  no  more 
against them because of the dark-
ness of their skins; neither shall ye 
revile against them because of their 
filthi ness;  but  ye  shall  remember 
your own filthiness, and remember 
that their filthiness came because 
of their fathers.

10 Wherefore, ye shall remember 
your  a children,  how  that  ye  have 
grieved their hearts because of the 
b example  that  ye  have  set  before 
them; and also, remember that ye 
may,  because  of  your  filthiness, 
bring your children unto destruc-
tion, and their sins be heaped upon 
your heads at the last day.

11 O my brethren, hearken unto 
my words; a arouse the faculties of 
your  souls;  shake  yourselves  that 
ye  may  b awake  from  the  slumber 
of death; and loose yourselves from 
the pains of c hell that ye may not 
become d angels to the devil, to be 
cast into that lake of fire and brim-
stone which is the second e death.

12 And now I, Jacob, spake many 
more  things  unto  the  people  of 
Nephi, a warning them against b for-
nication  and  c lasciviousness,  and 
every kind of sin, telling them the 
awful consequences of them.

13 And  a  hundredth  part  of  the 
proceedings of this people, which 
now  began  to  be  numerous,  can-
not be written upon a these plates; 

but many of their proceedings are 
written upon the b larger plates, and 
their wars, and their contentions, 
and the reigns of their kings.

14 a These  plates  are  called  the 
plates of Jacob, and they were b made 
by the hand of Nephi. And I make 
an end of speaking these words.

CHAPTER 4
All the prophets worshiped the Father 
in the name of Christ—Abraham’s of-
fering of Isaac was in similitude of God 
and His Only Begotten—Men should 
reconcile themselves to God through the 
Atonement—The  Jews  will  reject  the 
foundation stone. About 544–421 b.c.
Now  behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
I,  Jacob,  having  ministered  much 
unto  my  people  in  word,  (and  I 
cannot  write  but  a  a little  of  my 
words, because of the b difficulty of 
engraving our words upon plates) 
and we know that the things which 
we write upon plates must remain;
2 But whatsoever things we write 
upon  anything  save  it  be  upon 
a plates must perish and vanish away; 
but we can write a few words upon 
plates,  which  will  give  our  chil-
dren, and also our beloved breth-
ren,  a  small  degree  of  knowledge 
concerning us, or concerning their  
fathers—

3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; 
and we labor diligently to engraven 
these  words  upon  plates,  hoping 
that our beloved brethren and our 
children  will  receive  them  with 
thankful  hearts,  and  look  upon 
them that they may learn with joy 
and not with sorrow, neither with 
contempt,  concerning  their  first 
a parents.

124

4 For, for this intent have we writ-
ten  these  things,  that  they  may 
know that we a knew of Christ, and 
we had a hope of his b glory many 
hundred years before his coming; 
and  not  only  we  ourselves  had  a 
hope of his glory, but also all the 
holy c prophets which were before us.
5 Behold, they believed in Christ 
and  a worshiped  the  Father  in  his 
name,  and  also  we  worship  the 
Father in his  b name. And for this 
intent we c keep the d law of Moses, 
it  e pointing our souls to him; and 
for this cause it is sanctified unto 
us for righteousness, even as it was 
accounted  unto  Abraham  in  the 
wilderness to be obedient unto the 
commands of God in offering up his 
son Isaac, which is a f similitude of 
God and his g Only Begotten Son.

6 Wherefore, we search the proph-
ets, and we have many revelations 
and  the  spirit  of  a prophecy;  and 
having all these b witnesses we ob-
tain a hope, and our faith becometh 
unshaken, insomuch that we truly 
can  c command  in  the  d name  of 
Jesus  and  the  very  trees  obey  us, 
or the mountains, or the waves of  
the sea.

7 Nevertheless,  the  Lord  God 
showeth us our a weakness that we 

may know that it is by his b grace, 
and his great condescensions unto 
the children of men, that we have 
power to do these things.

8 Behold, great and marvelous are 
the  a works  of  the  Lord.  How  b un-
searchable  are  the  depths  of  the 
c mysteries of him; and it is impos-
sible that man should find out all  
his  ways.  And  no  man  d knoweth  
of his e ways save it be revealed unto 
him; wherefore, brethren, despise 
not the f revelations of God.

9 For behold, by the power of his 
a word b man came upon the face of 
the earth, which earth was c created 
by the power of his word. Where-
fore, if God being able to speak and  
the world was, and to speak and man  
was created, O then, why not able 
to  command  the  d earth,  or  the 
workmanship  of  his  hands  upon 
the face of it, according to his will 
and pleasure?

10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to 
a counsel the Lord, but to take coun-
sel from his hand. For behold, ye 
yourselves know that he counseleth 
in b wisdom, and in justice, and in 
great mercy, over all his works.

11 Wherefore,  beloved  brethren, 
be  a reconciled  unto  him  through

JACOB 4  : 12–18

Begotten  Son,  and  ye  may  obtain 
a  d resurrection,  according  to  the 
e power  of  the  resurrection  which 
is  in  Christ,  and  be  presented  as 
the f first-fruits of Christ unto God, 
having faith, and obtained a good 
hope  of  glory  in  him  before  he 
manifesteth himself in the flesh.

12 And now, beloved, marvel not 
that  I  tell  you  these  things;  for 
why  not  a speak  of  the  atonement 
of  Christ,  and  attain  to  a  perfect 
knowledge of him, as to attain to 
the  knowledge  of  a  resurrection 
and the world to come?

13 Behold,  my  brethren,  he  that 
prophesieth, let him prophesy to the 
understanding of men; for the a Spirit  
speaketh the  b truth and lieth not. 
Wherefore, it speaketh of things as 
they really c are, and of things as they  
really will be; wherefore, these things  
are  manifested  unto  us  d plainly, 
for the salvation of our souls. But 
behold, we are not witnesses alone 
in these things; for God also e spake 
them unto prophets of old.

14 But  behold,  the  Jews  were  a 
a stiffnecked people; and they b de-
spised the words of c plainness, and 
d killed the prophets, and sought for 
things that they could not under-
stand. Wherefore, because of their 
e blindness, which f  blindness came 
by looking beyond the g mark, they 
must needs fall; for God hath taken 
away his plainness from them, and 
delivered unto them many things 
which they h cannot understand, be-

cause they desired it. And because 
they  desired  it  God  hath  done  it, 
that they may i stumble.

15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by 
the Spirit unto prophesying; for I 
perceive by the workings of the Spirit  
which is in me, that by the a stum-
bling of the b Jews they will c reject 
the d stone upon which they might 
build and have safe foundation.

16 But  behold,  according  to  the 
scriptures, this a stone shall become 
the great, and the last, and the only 
sure b foundation, upon which the 
Jews can build.

17 And now, my beloved, how is 
it possible that these, after having 
rejected  the  sure  foundation,  can 
a ever build upon it, that it may be-
come the head of their corner?

18 Behold, my beloved brethren, 
I  will  unfold  this  mystery  unto 
you; if I do not, by any means, get 
shaken  from  my  firmness  in  the 
Spirit, and stumble because of my 
over anxiety for you.

gory of the tame and wild olive trees—
They are a likeness of Israel and the

and all the house of Israel—The Gen-

126

Behold, my brethren, do ye not re-
member to have read the words of 
the prophet a Zenos, which he spake 
unto the house of Israel, saying:

2 Hearken,  O  ye  house  of  Israel, 
and hear the words of me, a prophet 
of the Lord.

3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, 
I will liken thee, O house of a Israel, 
like unto a tame b olive tree, which 
a  man  took  and  nourished  in  his 
c vineyard; and it grew, and waxed 
old, and began to d decay.

4 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard went forth, and 
he saw that his olive tree began to 
decay;  and  he  said:  I  will  a prune 
it,  and  dig  about  it,  and  nourish 
it, that perhaps it may shoot forth 
young and tender branches, and it 
perish not.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
a pruned it, and digged about it, and 
nourished it according to his word.
6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
many  days  it  began  to  put  forth 
somewhat a little, young and tender 
branches; but behold, the main a top 
thereof began to perish.

7 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard saw it, and he 
said unto his a servant: It grieveth me 
that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, go and pluck the branches from 
a b wild olive tree, and bring them 
hither unto me; and we will pluck 
off those main branches which are 
beginning to wither away, and we 
will  cast  them  into  the  fire  that 
they may be burned.

8 And  behold,  saith  the  Lord  of 
the vineyard, I take a away many of 
these young and tender branches, 
and  I  will  graft  them  b whitherso-
ever I will; and it mattereth not that  

if it so be that the root of this tree 
will perish, I may preserve the fruit 
thereof  unto  myself;  wherefore,  I 
will  take  these  young  and  tender 
branches,  and  I  will  graft  them 
whithersoever I will.

9 Take  thou  the  branches  of  the 
wild olive tree, and graft them in, in 
the a stead thereof; and these which 
I have plucked off I will cast into 
the fire and burn them, that they 
may not cumber the ground of my 
vineyard.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servant  of  the  Lord  of  the  vine-
yard  did  according  to  the  word 
of  the  Lord  of  the  vineyard,  and 
grafted in the branches of the a wild  
olive tree.

11 And the Lord of the vineyard 
caused  that  it  should  be  digged 
about, and pruned, and nourished, 
saying unto his servant: It grieveth  
me that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, that perhaps I might preserve  
the roots thereof that they perish 
not,  that  I  might  preserve  them 
unto myself, I have done this thing.
12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch 
the tree, and nourish it, according 
to my words.

13 And these will I  a place in the 
nethermost  part  of  my  vineyard, 
whithersoever I will, it mattereth 
not unto thee; and I do it that I may 
preserve  unto  myself  the  natural 
branches of the tree; and also, that I 
may lay up fruit thereof against the 
season, unto myself; for it grieveth 
me that I should lose this tree and 
the fruit thereof.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard went his way, 
and hid the natural a branches of the 
tame olive tree in the nethermost

parts of the vineyard, some in one 
and some in another, according to 
his will and pleasure.

15 And it came to pass that a long 
time  passed  away,  and  the  Lord 
of the vineyard said unto his ser-
vant:  Come,  let  us  go  down  into 
the  vineyard,  that  we  may  a labor 
in the vineyard.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard, and also the 
servant, went down into the vine-
yard to labor. And it came to pass 
that the servant said unto his master:  
Behold, look here; behold the tree.
17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard looked and be-
held the tree in the which the wild 
olive  branches  had  been  grafted; 
and it had sprung forth and begun 
to bear a fruit. And he beheld that it 
was good; and the fruit thereof was 
like unto the natural fruit.

18 And he said unto the servant: 
Behold,  the  branches  of  the  wild 
tree have taken hold of the mois-
ture  of  the  root  thereof,  that  the 
root  thereof  hath  brought  forth 
much strength; and because of the 
much strength of the root thereof 
the  wild  branches  have  brought 
forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not 
grafted in these branches, the tree 
thereof would have perished. And 
now,  behold,  I  shall  lay  up  much 
fruit, which the tree thereof hath 
brought forth; and the fruit thereof 
I  shall  lay  up  against  the  season, 
unto mine own self.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  of  the  vineyard  said  unto 
the servant: Come, let us go to the 
nethermost  part  of  the  vineyard, 
and behold if the natural branches 
of the tree have not brought forth 
much fruit also, that I may lay up 
of the fruit thereof against the sea-
son, unto mine own self.

20 And it came to pass that they 

went forth whither the master had 
hid  the  natural  branches  of  the 
tree, and he said unto the servant: 
Behold  these;  and  he  beheld  the 
a first  that  it  had  b brought  forth 
much fruit; and he beheld also that 
it was good. And he said unto the 
servant: Take of the fruit thereof, 
and  lay  it  up  against  the  season, 
that  I  may  preserve  it  unto  mine 
own self; for behold, said he, this 
long time have I nourished it, and 
it hath brought forth much fruit.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servant said unto his master: How 
comest  thou  hither  to  plant  this 
tree, or this branch of the tree? For 
behold, it was the poorest spot in 
all the land of thy vineyard.

22 And the Lord of the vineyard 
said  unto  him:  Counsel  me  not;  I 
knew  that  it  was  a  poor  spot  of 
ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, 
I have nourished it this long time, 
and  thou  beholdest  that  it  hath 
brought forth much fruit.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto his 
servant: Look hither; behold I have 
planted another branch of the tree 
also; and thou knowest that this spot 
of ground was poorer than the first. 
But, behold the tree. I have nour-
ished it this long time, and it hath 
brought forth much fruit; therefore, 
gather it, and lay it up against the 
season, that I may preserve it unto 
mine own self.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said again unto 
his servant: Look hither, and behold 
another a branch also, which I have 
planted; behold that I have nour-
ished  it  also,  and  it  hath  brought 
forth fruit.

25 And he said unto the servant: 
Look  hither  and  behold  the  last. 
Behold,  this  have  I  planted  in  a 
a good  spot  of  ground;  and  I  have

nourished  it  this  long  time,  and 
only a b part of the tree hath brought 
forth tame fruit, and the c other part 
of the tree hath brought forth wild 
fruit; behold, I have nourished this 
tree like unto the others.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto the 
servant: Pluck off the branches that 
have not brought forth good a fruit, 
and cast them into the fire.

27 But  behold,  the  servant  said 
unto him: Let us prune it, and dig 
about it, and nourish it a little a lon-
ger, that perhaps it may bring forth 
good fruit unto thee, that thou canst 
lay it up against the season.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant of the Lord of the vineyard did 
nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.
29 And it came to pass that a a long 
time had passed away, and the Lord 
of the vineyard said unto his b ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into the 
vineyard, that we may labor again 
in  the  vineyard.  For  behold,  the 
time  draweth  near,  and  the  c end 
soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay 
up  fruit  against  the  season,  unto 
mine own self.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant went down into the vineyard; 
and  they  came  to  the  tree  whose 
natural branches had been broken 
off, and the wild branches had been 
grafted in; and behold all a sorts of 
fruit did cumber the tree.

31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard did  a taste of 
the fruit, every sort according to its 
number. And the Lord of the vine-
yard  said:  Behold,  this  long  time 
have  we  nourished  this  tree,  and 
I have laid up unto myself against 
the season much fruit.

32 But  behold,  this  time  it  hath 
brought forth much a fruit, and there 

is  b none  of  it  which  is  good.  And 
behold, there are all kinds of bad 
fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, 
notwithstanding all our labor; and 
now  it  grieveth  me  that  I  should 
lose this tree.

33 And the Lord of the vineyard 
said unto the servant: What shall 
we do unto the tree, that I may pre-
serve again good fruit thereof unto 
mine own self?

34 And the servant said unto his 
master: Behold, because thou didst 
graft  in  the  branches  of  the  wild 
olive tree they have nourished the 
roots, that they are alive and they 
have not perished; wherefore thou 
beholdest that they are yet good.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto his 
servant: The tree profiteth me noth-
ing, and the roots thereof profit me 
nothing  so  long  as  it  shall  bring 
forth evil fruit.

36 Nevertheless,  I  know  that  the 
roots are good, and for mine own 
purpose I have preserved them; and 
because of their much strength they 
have hitherto brought forth, from 
the wild branches, good fruit.

37 But behold, the wild branches 
have grown and have a overrun the 
roots  thereof;  and  because  that  
the wild branches have overcome the  
roots thereof it hath brought forth 
much evil fruit; and because that 
it hath brought forth so much evil 
fruit thou beholdest that it begin-
neth to perish; and it will soon be-
come ripened, that it may be cast 
into the fire, except we should do 
something for it to preserve it.

38 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto his 
servant:  Let  us  go  down  into  the 
nethermost parts of the vineyard, 
and behold if the natural branches 
have also brought forth evil fruit.

JACOB 5  : 40–50

went  down  into  the  nethermost 
parts of the vineyard. And it came 
to  pass  that  they  beheld  that  the 
fruit of the natural branches had 
become corrupt also; yea, the a first 
and  the  second  and  also  the  last; 
and they had all become corrupt.

40 And the a wild fruit of the last 
had overcome that part of the tree 
which  brought  forth  good  fruit, 
even that the branch had withered 
away and died.

41 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  of  the  vineyard  wept,  and 
said unto the servant: a What could 
I have done more for my vineyard?
42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of 
the vineyard, save it were these, had 
become a corrupted. And now these 
which have once brought forth good 
fruit  have  also  become  corrupted; 
and now all the trees of my vineyard 
are good for nothing save it be to be 
b hewn down and cast into the fire.

43 And  behold  this  last,  whose 
branch hath withered away, I did 
plant in a a good spot of ground; yea, 
even that which was choice unto me 
above all other parts of the land of 
my vineyard.

44 And thou beheldest that I also 
cut  down  that  which  a cumbered 
this  spot  of  ground,  that  I  might 
plant this tree in the stead thereof.
45 And thou beheldest that a a part 
thereof  brought  forth  good  fruit, 
and  a  part  thereof  brought  forth 
wild fruit; and because I plucked 
not the branches thereof and cast 
them into the fire, behold, they have 
overcome the good branch that it 
hath withered away.

46 And now, behold, notwithstand-
ing all the care which we have taken 
of  my  vineyard,  the  trees  thereof 
have become corrupted, that they 

bring forth no good a fruit; and these 
I had hoped to preserve, to have laid 
up fruit thereof against the season, 
unto  mine  own  self.  But,  behold, 
they  have  become  like  unto  the 
wild olive tree, and they are of no 
worth but to be  b hewn down and 
cast  into  the  fire;  and  it  grieveth 
me that I should lose them.

47 But  a what  could  I  have  done 
more in my vineyard? Have I slack-
ened  mine  hand,  that  I  have  not 
nourished it? Nay, I have nourished 
it, and I have digged about it, and I 
have pruned it, and I have dunged 
it; and I have b stretched forth mine 
c hand almost all the day long, and 
the d end draweth nigh. And it griev-
eth me that I should hew down all 
the trees of my vineyard, and cast 
them into the fire that they should 
be burned. Who is it that has cor-
rupted my vineyard?

48 And it came to pass that the ser-
vant said unto his master: Is it not 
the a loftiness of thy vineyard—have 
not the branches thereof overcome 
the roots which are good? And be-
cause the branches have overcome 
the roots thereof, behold they grew 
faster than the strength of the roots, 
b taking strength unto themselves. 
Behold, I say, is not this the cause 
that the trees of thy vineyard have 
become corrupted?

49 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto the 
servant: Let us go to and hew down 
the trees of the vineyard and cast 
them into the fire, that they shall 
not cumber the ground of my vine-
yard, for I have done all. What could 
I have done more for my vineyard?
50 But,  behold,  the  servant  said 
unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare 
it a little a longer.

51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will 
spare it a little longer, for it griev-
eth me that I should lose the trees 
of my vineyard.

52 Wherefore,  let  us  take  of  the 
a branches  of  these  which  I  have 
planted in the nethermost parts of  
my vineyard, and let us graft them 
into the tree from whence they came;  
and let us pluck from the tree those 
branches whose fruit is most bitter, 
and graft in the natural branches of 
the tree in the stead thereof.

53 And this will I do that the tree 
may  not  perish,  that,  perhaps,  I 
may preserve unto myself the roots 
thereof for mine a own purpose.

54 And,  behold,  the  roots  of  the 
natural branches of the tree which 
I planted whithersoever I would are 
yet alive; wherefore, that I may pre-
serve them also for mine own pur-
pose, I will take of the a branches of 
this tree, and I will b graft them in 
unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto 
them the branches of their mother 
tree, that I may preserve the roots 
also unto mine own self, that when 
they  shall  be  sufficiently  strong 
perhaps they may bring forth good 
fruit unto me, and I may yet have 
glory in the fruit of my vineyard.

55 And it came to pass that they 
took  from  the  natural  tree  which 
had  become  wild,  and  grafted  in 
unto the natural trees, which also 
had become wild.

56 And they also took of the natu-
ral trees which had become wild, 
and a grafted into their mother tree.
57 And the Lord of the vineyard 
said unto the servant: Pluck not the 
wild branches from the trees, save 
it be those which are most bitter; 
and in them ye shall graft accord-
ing to that which I have said.

58 And we will nourish again the 
trees of the vineyard, and we will 
trim up the a branches thereof; and 
we will pluck from the trees those 
branches  which  are  ripened,  that 
must  perish,  and  cast  them  into 
the fire.

59 And this I do that, perhaps, the 
roots thereof may take strength be-
cause of their goodness; and because 
of the change of the branches, that 
the good may a overcome the evil.
60 And  because  that  I  have  pre-
served  the  natural  branches  and  
the roots thereof, and that I have 
grafted in the natural branches again 
into  their  mother  tree,  and  have 
preserved the roots of their mother 
tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my 
vineyard  may  bring  forth  again 
good a fruit; and that I may have joy 
again in the fruit of my vineyard, 
and,  perhaps,  that  I  may  rejoice 
exceedingly that I have preserved 
the roots and the branches of the  
first fruit—

61 Wherefore, go to, and call a ser-
vants, that we may b labor diligently 
with our might in the vineyard, that 
we may c prepare the way, that I may 
bring forth again the natural fruit, 
which natural fruit is good and the 
most precious above all other fruit.
62 Wherefore, let us go to and la-
bor with our might this last time, 
for behold the end draweth nigh, 
and this is for the last time that I 
shall a prune my vineyard.

63 Graft in the branches; begin at 
the a last that they may be first, and 
that the first may be b last, and dig 
about the trees, both old and young, 
the first and the last; and the last 
and the first, that all may be nour-
ished once again for the last time.

and  prune  them,  and  dung  them 
once  more,  for  the  last  time,  for 
the end draweth nigh. And if it be 
so that these last grafts shall grow, 
and bring forth the natural fruit, 
then shall ye prepare the way for 
them, that they may grow.

65 And  as  they  begin  to  grow 
ye shall  a clear away the branches 
which bring forth bitter fruit, ac-
cording to the strength of the good 
and the size thereof; and ye shall 
not clear away the bad thereof all 
at once, lest the roots thereof should 
be too strong for the graft, and the 
graft thereof shall perish, and I lose 
the trees of my vineyard.

66 For it grieveth me that I should 
lose the trees of my vineyard; where-
fore ye shall clear away the bad ac-
cording as the good shall grow, that 
the root and the top may be equal 
in  strength,  until  the  good  shall 
overcome the bad, and the bad be 
hewn down and cast into the fire, 
that they cumber not the ground of 
my vineyard; and thus will I sweep 
away the bad out of my vineyard.
67 And  the  branches  of  the  nat-
ural tree will I graft in again into 
the natural tree;

68 And the branches of the natu-
ral tree will I graft into the natural 
branches of the tree; and thus will 
I  bring  them  together  again,  that 
they shall bring forth the natural 
a fruit, and they shall be one.

69 And the bad shall be a cast away, 
yea, even out of all the land of my 
vineyard; for behold, only this once 
will I prune my vineyard.

70 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard sent his a ser-
vant; and the servant went and did 
as the Lord had commanded him, 
and  brought  other  b servants;  and 
they were c few.

71 And the Lord of the vineyard 

said unto them: Go to, and  a labor 
in the vineyard, with your might. 
For  behold,  this  is  the  b last  time 
that I shall c nourish my vineyard; 
for the end is nigh at hand, and the 
season speedily cometh; and if ye  
labor  with  your  might  with  me  
ye shall have joy in the fruit which 
I shall lay up unto myself against 
the time which will soon come.

72 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servants did go and labor with their 
mights; and the Lord of the vineyard 
labored  also  with  them;  and  they  
did obey the commandments of the 
Lord of the vineyard in all things.
73 And there began to be the natu-
ral fruit again in the vineyard; and 
the natural branches began to grow 
and thrive exceedingly; and the wild 
branches began to be plucked off 
and to be cast away; and they did 
keep the root and the top thereof 
equal,  according  to  the  strength 
thereof.

74 And  thus  they  labored,  with 
all diligence, according to the com-
mandments of the Lord of the vine-
yard, even until the bad had been 
cast away out of the vineyard, and 
the Lord had preserved unto himself  
that the trees had become again the 
natural fruit; and they became like 
unto a one body; and the fruits were 
equal; and the Lord of the vineyard 
had preserved unto himself the natu-
ral fruit, which was most precious 
unto him from the beginning.

75 And it came to pass that when 
the a Lord of the vineyard saw that 
his  fruit  was  good,  and  that  his 
vineyard was no more corrupt, he 
called up his servants, and said unto 
them: Behold, for this last time have 
we  nourished  my  vineyard;  and 
thou  beholdest  that  I  have  done 
according  to  my  will;  and  I  have 
preserved the natural fruit, that it

is good, even like as it was in the 
beginning. And  b blessed art thou; 
for because ye have been diligent in 
laboring with me in my vineyard, 
and have kept my commandments, 
and  have  brought  unto  me  again 
the c natural fruit, that my vineyard 
is no more corrupted, and the bad 
is cast away, behold ye shall have 
d joy with me because of the fruit 
of my vineyard.

76 For behold, for a a long time will 
I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard 
unto mine own self against the sea-
son, which speedily cometh; and for 
the last time have I nourished my 
vineyard, and pruned it, and dug 
about it, and dunged it; wherefore 
I will lay up unto mine own self of 
the fruit, for a long time, according 
to that which I have spoken.

77 And when the time cometh that  
evil fruit shall again come into my 
vineyard, then will I cause the a good 
and the bad to be gathered; and the 
good will I preserve unto myself, and  
the bad will I cast away into its own 
place. And then cometh the b season 
and the end; and my vineyard will 
I cause to be c burned with d fire.

CHAPTER 6

The Lord will recover Israel in the last 
days—The world will be burned with 
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid 
the lake of fire and brimstone. About 
544–421 b.c.

And now, behold, my brethren, as I 
said unto you that I would proph-
esy, behold, this is my prophecy—
that the things which this prophet 
a Zenos spake, concerning the house 
of Israel, in the which he likened 
them unto a tame b olive tree, must 
surely come to pass.

2 And  the  day  that  he  shall  set 
his hand again the second time to 
a recover his people, is the day, yea, 
even  the  last  time,  that  the  b ser-
vants of the Lord shall go forth in 
his  c power, to  d nourish and prune 
his  e vineyard;  and  after  that  the 
f end soon cometh.

3 And how a blessed are they who 
have labored b diligently in his vine-
yard; and how c cursed are they who  
shall  be  cast  out  into  their  own 
place!  And  the  d world  shall  be 
e burned with fire.

4 And  how  merciful  is  our  God 
unto  us,  for  he  remembereth  the 
house  of  a Israel,  both  roots  and 
branches; and he stretches forth his 
b hands unto them all the day long; 
and they are a  c stiffnecked and a 
gainsaying people; but as many as 
will not harden their hearts shall 
be saved in the kingdom of God.

5 Wherefore,  my  beloved  breth-
ren,  I  beseech  of  you  in  words  of 
soberness that ye would repent, and 
come  with  full  purpose  of  heart, 
and a cleave unto God as he cleaveth 
unto  you.  And  while  his  b arm  of 
mercy is extended towards you in

JACOB 6  : 6–7  : 5

the  light  of  the  day,  harden  not 
your hearts.

6 Yea,  today,  if  ye  will  hear  his 
voice, harden not your hearts; for 
why will ye a die?

7 For behold, after ye have been 
nourished by the good a word of God 
all the day long, will ye bring forth 
evil  fruit,  that  ye  must  be  b hewn 
down and cast into the fire?

8 Behold,  will  ye  reject  these 
words? Will ye reject the words of 
the a prophets; and will ye reject all 
the words which have been spoken 
concerning  Christ,  after  so  many 
have spoken concerning him; and 
b deny the good word of Christ, and 
the power of God, and the c gift of 
the  Holy  Ghost,  and  quench  the 
Holy Spirit, and make a  d mock of 
the great plan of redemption, which 
hath been laid for you?

9 Know ye not that if ye will do 
these things, that the power of the 
redemption  and  the  resurrection, 
which is in Christ, will bring you 
to  stand  with  a shame  and  b awful 
c guilt before the bar of God?

10 And according to the power of 
a justice, for justice cannot be denied, 
ye must go away into that b lake of 
fire and brimstone, whose flames 
are unquenchable, and whose smoke 
ascendeth  up  forever  and  ever, 
which lake of fire and brimstone 
is c endless d torment.

11 O then, my beloved brethren, 
repent ye, and enter in at the a strait 
gate,  and  b continue  in  the  way 
which is narrow, until ye shall ob-
tain eternal life.

12 O be a wise; what can I say more?
13 Finally, I bid you farewell, until 

I shall meet you before the a pleas-
ing bar of God, which bar striketh 
the wicked with b awful dread and 
fear. Amen.

CHAPTER 7
Sherem  denies  Christ,  contends  with 
Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten 
of God—All of the prophets have spo-
ken of Christ and His Atonement—The 
Nephites lived out their days as wan-
derers, born in tribulation, and hated 
by the Lamanites. About 544–421 b.c.
And now it came to pass after some 
years had passed away, there came 
a man among the people of Nephi, 
whose name was a Sherem.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
began  to  preach  among  the  peo-
ple, and to declare unto them that 
there should be a no Christ. And he 
preached many things which were 
flattering unto the people; and this 
he did that he might b overthrow the 
doctrine of Christ.

3 And he labored diligently that he 
might lead away the hearts of the  
people, insomuch that he did lead 
away many hearts; and he knowing  
that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who  
should come, he sought much oppor-
tunity that he might come unto me.
4 And  he  was  a learned,  that  he 
had a perfect knowledge of the lan-
guage of the people; wherefore, he 
could use much b flattery, and much 
power of speech, according to the 
c power of the devil.

5 And  he  had  hope  to  shake  me 
from the faith, notwithstanding the 
many  a revelations  and  the  many 
things which I had seen concerning

134

these  things;  for  I  truly  had  seen 
b angels,  and  they  had  ministered 
unto me. And also, I had c heard the 
voice of the Lord speaking unto me 
in  very  word,  from  time  to  time; 
wherefore, I could not be shaken.

6 And it came to pass that he came 
unto me, and on this wise did he 
speak unto me, saying: Brother Ja-
cob, I have sought much opportu-
nity that I might speak unto you; 
for I have heard and also know that 
thou goest about much, preaching 
that  which  ye  call  the  a gospel,  or 
the doctrine of Christ.

7 And ye have led away much of 
this  people  that  they  pervert  the 
right  way  of  God,  and  a keep  not 
the law of Moses which is the right 
way; and convert the law of Moses 
into the worship of a being which 
ye  say  shall  come  many  hundred 
years  hence.  And  now  behold,  I, 
Sherem, declare unto you that this 
is b blasphemy; for no man knoweth 
of such things; for he cannot c tell of 
things to come. And after this man-
ner did Sherem contend against me.
8 But behold, the Lord God poured 
in  his  a Spirit  into  my  soul,  inso-
much that I did b confound him in 
all his words.

9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou 
the Christ who shall come? And he 
said: If there should be a Christ, I 
would  not  deny  him;  but  I  know 
that there is no Christ, neither has 
been, nor ever will be.

10 And I said unto him: Believest 
thou the scriptures? And he said, 
Yea.

11 And I said unto him: Then ye do 
not understand them; for they truly 
testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto  

you that none of the a prophets have 
written, nor b prophesied, save they 
have spoken concerning this Christ.
12 And this is not all—it has been 
made manifest unto me, for I have 
heard and seen; and it also has been 
made  manifest  unto  me  by  the 
a power of the Holy Ghost; where-
fore, I know if there should be no 
atonement made all mankind must  
be b lost.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
said unto me: Show me a a sign by 
this power of the Holy Ghost, in the 
which ye know so much.

14 And I said unto him: What am 
I that I should a tempt God to show 
unto thee a sign in the thing which 
thou knowest to be b true? Yet thou 
wilt deny it, because thou art of the 
c devil. Nevertheless, not my will be 
done; but if God shall smite thee, 
let  that  be  a  d sign  unto  thee  that 
he has power, both in heaven and 
in earth; and also, that Christ shall 
come. And thy will, O Lord, be done,  
and not mine.

15 And it came to pass that when I, 
Jacob, had spoken these words, the 
power of the Lord came upon him,  
insomuch that he fell to the earth. 
And it came to pass that he was nour-
ished for the space of many days.

16 And it came to pass that he said 
unto the people: Gather together on 
the morrow, for I shall die; where-
fore,  I  desire  to  speak  unto  the  
people before I shall die.

17 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow the multitude were gath-
ered together; and he spake plainly 
unto  them  and  denied  the  things 
which  he  had  taught  them,  and 
confessed the Christ, and the power

of the Holy Ghost, and the minis-
tering of angels.

18 And  he  spake  plainly  unto 
them, that he had been  a deceived 
by the power of the b devil. And he 
spake of hell, and of c eternity, and 
of eternal d punishment.

19 And he said: I a fear lest I have 
committed the b unpardonable sin, 
for I have lied unto God; for I de-
nied the Christ, and said that I be-
lieved the scriptures; and they truly 
testify of him. And because I have 
thus  lied  unto  God  I  greatly  fear 
lest my case shall be c awful; but I 
confess unto God.

20 And it came to pass that when 
he had said these words he could say  
no more, and he a gave up the b ghost.
21 And when the multitude had 
witnessed that he spake these things 
as he was about to give up the ghost, 
they were astonished exceedingly; 
insomuch  that  the  power  of  God 
came  down  upon  them,  and  they 
were  a overcome  that  they  fell  to 
the earth.

22 Now,  this  thing  was  pleasing 
unto me, Jacob, for I had requested 
it of my Father who was in heaven; 
for  he  had  heard  my  cry  and  an-
swered my prayer.

23 And it came to pass that peace 
and the a love of God was restored 
again among the people; and they 
b searched the scriptures, and heark-
ened no more to the words of this 
wicked man.

24 And it came to pass that many 
means  were  devised  to  a reclaim 
and  restore  the  Lamanites  to  the 
knowledge of the truth; but it all 

was  b vain,  for  they  delighted  in 
c wars and d bloodshed, and they had 
an eternal e hatred against us, their 
brethren. And they sought by the 
power of their arms to destroy us 
continually.

25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi 
did fortify against them with their 
arms, and with all their might, trust-
ing in the God and  a rock of their 
salvation; wherefore, they became 
as yet, conquerors of their enemies.
26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I,  
Jacob,  began  to  be  old;  and  the 
record of this people being kept on 
the a other plates of Nephi, where-
fore, I conclude this record, declar-
ing that I have written according to 
the best of my knowledge, by say-
ing that the time passed away with 
us, and also our b lives passed away 
like as it were unto us a c dream, we 
being  a  d lonesome  and  a  solemn 
people,  e wanderers, cast out from 
Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a 
wilderness, and hated of our breth-
ren, which caused wars and conten-
tions; wherefore, we did mourn out  
our days.

27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must 
soon go down to my grave; where-
fore, I said unto my son a Enos: Take 
these  b plates.  And  I  told  him  the 
things  which  my  brother  Nephi 
had c commanded me, and he prom-
ised obedience unto the commands. 
And I make an end of my writing 
upon  these  plates,  which  writing 
has been d small; and to the reader 
I bid farewell, hoping that many of 
my brethren may read my words.

The Book of enos

Enos  prays  mightily  and  gains  a  re-
mission  of  his  sins—The  voice  of  the 
Lord  comes  into  his  mind,  promising 
salvation for the Lamanites in a future 
day—The  Nephites  sought  to  reclaim 
the  Lamanites—Enos  rejoices  in  his 
Redeemer. About 420 b.c.

BEHOLD,  it  came  to  pass  that  

   I,  a Enos,  knowing  my  father  
   that  b he was a just man—for 
he c taught me in his language, and  
also  in  the  d nurture  and  admoni-
tion  of  the  Lord—and  blessed  be 
the name of my God for it—

2 And I will tell you of the a wres-
tle which I had before God, before 
I received a b remission of my sins.
3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in 
the forests; and the words which I 
had  often  heard  my  father  speak 
concerning eternal life, and the a joy 
of  the  saints,  b sunk  deep  into  my  
heart.

4 And  my  soul  a hungered;  and  I 
b kneeled  down  before  my  Maker, 
and  I  c cried  unto  him  in  mighty 
d prayer and supplication for mine 
own soul; and all the day long did 
I cry unto him; yea, and when the 
night came I did still raise my voice 
high that it reached the heavens.

5 And there came a a voice unto me, 
saying: Enos, thy sins are b forgiven 
thee, and thou shalt be blessed.

6 And  I,  Enos,  knew  that  God 
a could not lie; wherefore, my guilt 
was swept away.

7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?
8 And he said unto me: a Because 
of thy b faith in Christ, whom thou 
hast never before heard nor seen. 
And many years pass away before 
he  shall  manifest  himself  in  the 
flesh;  wherefore,  go  to,  thy  faith 
hath made thee c whole.

9 Now, it came to pass that when 
I had heard these words I began to 
feel a a desire for the b welfare of my 
brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, 
I did c pour out my whole soul unto 
God for them.

10 And  while  I  was  thus  strug-
gling in the spirit, behold, the voice 
of  the  Lord  came  into  my  a mind 
again, saying: I will visit thy breth-
ren according to their diligence in 
keeping my commandments. I have 
b given unto them this land, and it 
is  a  holy  land;  and  I  c curse  it  not 
save it be for the cause of iniquity; 
wherefore,  I  will  visit  thy  breth-
ren  according  as  I  have  said;  and 
their  d transgressions  will  I  bring 
down with sorrow upon their own  
heads.

11 And  after  I,  Enos,  had  heard 
these  words,  my  a faith  began  to 
be  b unshaken  in  the  Lord;  and  I 
c prayed unto him with many long

ENOS 1  : 12–22

d strugglings  for  my  brethren,  the 
Lamanites.

12 And it came to pass that after 
I had a prayed and labored with all 
diligence, the Lord said unto me: I 
will grant unto thee according to 
thy b desires, because of thy faith.

13 And now behold, this was the 
desire which I desired of him—that 
if it should so be, that my people, 
the Nephites, should fall into trans-
gression, and by any means be a de-
stroyed, and the Lamanites should 
not  be  b destroyed,  that  the  Lord 
God  would  c preserve  a  record  of 
my people, the Nephites; even if it 
so be by the power of his holy arm, 
that it might be  d brought forth at 
some future day unto the Laman-
ites,  that,  perhaps,  they  might  be 
e brought unto salvation—

14 For  at  the  present  our  strug-
glings were a vain in restoring them 
to the true faith. And they swore in 
their wrath that, if it were possible, 
they  would  b destroy  our  records 
and us, and also all the traditions 
of our fathers.

15 Wherefore, I knowing that the 
Lord God was able to a preserve our 
records, I cried unto him continu-
ally, for he had said unto me: What-
soever thing ye shall ask in faith, 
believing that ye shall receive in the 
name of Christ, ye shall receive it.
16 And I had faith, and I did cry 
unto God that he would a preserve 
the  b records;  and  he  covenanted 
with me that he would c bring d them 
forth unto the Lamanites in his own 
due time.

17 And I, Enos, a knew it would be 
according  to  the  covenant  which 
he  had  made;  wherefore  my  soul 
did rest.

18 And  the  Lord  said  unto  me: 
Thy fathers have also required of 
me this thing; and it shall be done 
unto them according to their faith; 
for their faith was like unto thine.
19 And now it came to pass that I, 
Enos, went about among the people 
of Nephi, prophesying of things to 
come, and testifying of the things 
which I had heard and seen.

20 And  I  bear  record  that  the  
people of Nephi did seek diligently 
to  a restore  the  Lamanites  unto 
the true faith in God. But our b la-
bors  were  vain;  their  c hatred  was 
fixed, and they were led by their 
evil nature that they became wild, 
and ferocious, and a d blood-thirsty  
people, full of e idolatry and f filthi-
ness; feeding upon beasts of prey; 
dwelling in g tents, and wandering 
about in the wilderness with a short 
skin  girdle  about  their  loins  and 
their heads shaven; and their skill 
was in the h bow, and in the cimeter, 
and the ax. And many of them did 
eat nothing save it was raw meat; 
and they were continually seeking 
to destroy us.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of Nephi did till the land, 
and a raise all manner of grain, and 
of fruit, and  b flocks of herds, and 
flocks of all manner of cattle of ev-
ery kind, and goats, and wild goats, 
and also many horses.

22 And  there  were  exceedingly

many a prophets among us. And the 
people were a b stiffnecked people, 
hard to understand.

23 And there was nothing save it 
was exceeding a harshness, b preach-
ing and prophesying of wars, and 
contentions, and destructions, and 
continually  c reminding  them  of 
death, and the duration of eternity, 
and the judgments and the power of 
God, and all these things—stirring 
them up d continually to keep them 
in the fear of the Lord. I say there 
was nothing short of these things, 
and exceedingly great plainness of 
speech, would keep them from go-
ing down speedily to destruction. 
And  after  this  manner  do  I  write 
concerning them.

24 And  I  saw  a wars  between  the 
Nephites  and  Lamanites  in  the 
course of my days.

25 And it came to pass that I be-
gan to be old, and an hundred and 

seventy and nine years had passed 
away from the time that our father 
Lehi a left Jerusalem.

26 And  I  saw  that  I  a must  soon 
go down to my grave, having been 
wrought upon by the power of God 
that  I  must  preach  and  prophesy 
unto  this  people,  and  declare  the 
word according to the truth which 
is in Christ. And I have declared it 
in all my days, and have rejoiced 
in it above that of the world.

27 And I soon go to the place of my 
a rest, which is with my Redeemer; 
for I know that in him I shall b rest. 
And I rejoice in the day when my 
c mortal shall put on d immortality, 
and  shall  stand  before  him;  then 
shall I see his face with pleasure, 
and he will say unto me: Come unto 
me, ye blessed, there is a place pre-
pared for you in the e mansions of 
my Father. Amen.

The Book of JAroM

The  Nephites  keep  the  law  of  Moses, 
look forward to the coming of Christ, 
and prosper in the land—Many proph-
ets labor to keep the people in the way 
of truth. About 399–361 b.c.

NOW behold, I, Jarom, write 

a  few  words  according  to 
the  commandment  of  my 
father,  Enos,  that  our  a genealogy 
may be kept.

2 And as a these plates are b small, 

and  as  these  things  are  c written 
for the intent of the benefit of our 
brethren the d Lamanites, wherefore, 
it must needs be that I write a little; 
but I shall not write the things of 
my prophesying, nor of my revela-
tions. For what could I write more 
than my fathers have written? For 
have not they revealed the plan of 
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and 
this sufficeth me.

JAROM 1  : 4–11

should be done among this people, 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts, and the deafness of their ears,  
and the blindness of their minds, 
and  the  a stiffness  of  their  necks; 
nevertheless,  God  is  exceedingly 
merciful unto them, and has not as 
yet b swept them off from the face 
of the land.

4 And there are many among us 
who  have  many  a revelations,  for 
they are not all b stiffnecked. And as  
many  as  are  not  stiffnecked  and 
have faith, have c communion with 
the Holy Spirit, which maketh mani-
fest unto the children of men, ac-
cording to their faith.

5 And now, behold, two hundred 
years  had  passed  away,  and  the 
people of Nephi had waxed strong 
in the land. They observed to a keep 
the law of Moses and the b sabbath 
day holy unto the Lord. And they 
c profaned  not;  neither  did  they 
d blaspheme.  And  the  e laws  of  the 
land were exceedingly strict.

6 And  they  were  scattered  upon 
a much of the face of the land, and 
the Lamanites also. And they were 
exceedingly more b numerous than 
were they of the Nephites; and they 
loved c murder and would drink the 
d blood of beasts.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  many  times  against  us,  the 
Nephites, to battle. But our a kings 
and our b leaders were mighty men 
in the faith of the Lord; and they 
taught the people the ways of the 
Lord; wherefore, we withstood the 
Lamanites and swept them away out 

of c our lands, and began to fortify 
our  cities,  or  whatsoever  place  of 
our inheritance.

8 And we multiplied exceedingly, 
and  spread  upon  the  face  of  the 
land, and became exceedingly rich 
in a gold, and in silver, and in pre-
cious things, and in fine b workman-
ship of wood, in buildings, and in 
c machinery,  and  also  in  iron  and 
copper, and brass and steel, making 
all manner of tools of every kind 
to till the ground, and d weapons of 
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow, 
and the quiver, and the dart, and 
the  javelin,  and  all  preparations  
for war.

9 And thus being prepared to meet 
the Lamanites, they did not prosper 
against us. But the word of the Lord 
was verified, which he spake unto 
our fathers, saying that: a Inasmuch 
as ye will keep my commandments 
ye shall b prosper in the land.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
prophets of the Lord did threaten 
the people of Nephi, according to 
the  word  of  God,  that  if  they  did 
not keep the commandments, but 
should fall into transgression, they 
should be a destroyed from off the 
face of the land.

11 Wherefore,  the  prophets,  and 
the priests, and the  a teachers, did 
labor diligently, exhorting with all 
long-suffering the people to  b dili-
gence; teaching the c law of Moses, 
and  the  intent  for  which  it  was 
given;  persuading  them  to  d look 
forward unto the Messiah, and be-
lieve in him to come e as though he

already was. And after this manner 
did they teach them.

12 And it came to pass that by so 
doing they kept them from being 
a destroyed upon the face of the land; 
for they did b prick their hearts with 
the word, c continually stirring them 
up unto repentance.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and thirty and eight years 
had  passed  away—after  the  man-
ner of wars, and a contentions, and 
dissensions, for the space of b much 
of the time.

14 And I, Jarom, do not write more, 
for the plates are a small. But behold, 
my brethren, ye can go to the b other 
plates of Nephi; for behold, upon 
them  the  records  of  our  wars  are 
engraven, according to the writings 
of the c kings, or those which they 
caused to be written.

15 And I deliver these plates into 
the  hands  of  my  son  Omni,  that 
they may be kept according to the  
a commandments of my fathers.

The Book of oMni

Omni,  Amaron,  Chemish,  Abinadom, 
and  Amaleki,  each  in  turn,  keep  the 
records—Mosiah  discovers  the  people 
of Zarahemla, who came from Jerusa-
lem in the days of Zedekiah—Mosiah is 
made king over them—The descendants 
of Mulek at Zarahemla had discovered 
Coriantumr, the last of the Jaredites—
King Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men 
should offer their souls as an offering 
to Christ. About 323–130 b.c.

BEHOLD, it came to pass that I,  

   Omni,  being  commanded  by  
  my father, Jarom, that I should 
write somewhat upon a these plates, 
to preserve our genealogy—

2 Wherefore, in my days, I would 
that ye should know that I fought 
much  with  the  sword  to  preserve 
my people, the Nephites, from fall-
ing into the hands of their enemies, 
the Lamanites. But behold, I of my-
self a am a wicked man, and I have 
not kept the statutes and the com-
mandments of the Lord as I ought 
to have done.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and seventy and six years 
had passed away, and we had many  
seasons  of  peace;  and  we  had  
many  a seasons of serious war and 
bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hun-
dred and eighty and two years had 
passed away, and I had kept these 
plates according to the b command-
ments  of  my  c fathers;  and  I  d con-
ferred them upon my son Amaron.  
And I make an end.

4 And  now  I,  Amaron,  write  the 
things  whatsoever  I  write,  which 
are few, in the book of my father.

5 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
three  hundred  and  twenty  years 
had  passed  away,  and  the  more 
wicked part of the Nephites were  
a destroyed.

6 For the Lord would not suffer, 
after  he  had  led  them  out  of  the 
land  of  Jerusalem  and  kept  and 
preserved them from falling into 
the  hands  of  their  enemies,  yea, 
he would not suffer that the words 
should  not  be  verified,  which  he

spake unto our fathers, saying that: 
a Inasmuch as ye will not keep my 
commandments ye shall not b pros-
per in the land.

7 Wherefore,  the  Lord  did  visit 
them  in  great  judgment;  never-
theless, he did spare the righteous 
that  they  should  not  perish,  but 
did deliver them out of the hands 
of their enemies.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  did 
deliver the plates unto my brother 
Chemish.

9 Now I, Chemish, write what few 
things I write, in the same book with 
my brother; for behold, I saw the 
last which he wrote, that he wrote it  
with his own hand; and he wrote  
it in the day that he delivered them 
unto me. And after this manner we 
keep the a records, for it is accord-
ing  to  the  commandments  of  our 
fathers. And I make an end.

10 Behold,  I,  Abinadom,  am  the 
son  of  Chemish.  Behold,  it  came 
to  pass  that  I  saw  much  war  and 
contention between my people, the 
Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, 
with my own sword, have taken the 
lives of many of the Lamanites in 
the defence of my brethren.

11 And behold, the a record of this 
people  is  engraven  upon  plates 
which is had by the b kings, accord-
ing to the generations; and I know 
of  no  revelation  save  that  which 
has been written, neither prophecy; 
wherefore, that which is sufficient 
is written. And I make an end.

12 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of 
Abinadom. Behold, I will speak unto 
you somewhat concerning a Mosiah, 
who was made king over the b land 
of Zarahemla; for behold, he being 
c warned of the Lord that he should  

d flee out of the e land of f  Nephi, and 
as many as would hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord should also  g de-
part out of the land with him, into 
the wilderness—

13 And it came to pass that he did 
according  as  the  Lord  had  com-
manded  him.  And  they  departed 
out of the land into the wilderness, 
as many as would hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord; and they were led 
by  many  preachings  and  prophe-
syings. And they were admonished 
continually by the word of God; and 
they were led by the power of his 
a arm, through the wilderness until 
they came down into the land which 
is called the b land of Zarahemla.

14 And  they  discovered  a  a peo-
ple, who were called the people of 
Zarahemla.  Now,  there  was  great 
rejoicing among the people of Zar-
ahemla; and also Zarahemla did re-
joice exceedingly, because the Lord 
had sent the people of Mosiah with 
the b plates of brass which contained 
the record of the Jews.

15 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
Mosiah discovered that the people 
of a Zarahemla came out from Jeru-
salem at the time that  b Zedekiah, 
king  of  Judah,  was  carried  away 
captive into Babylon.

16 And they a journeyed in the wil-
derness, and were brought by the 
hand of the Lord across the great 
waters, into the land where Mosiah 
discovered them; and they had dwelt 
there from that time forth.

17 And  at  the  time  that  Mosiah 
discovered them, they had become 
exceedingly  numerous.  Neverthe-
less, they had had many wars and 
serious contentions, and had fallen 
by the sword from time to time; and

their  a language  had  become  cor-
rupted;  and  they  had  brought  no 
b records  with  them;  and  they  de-
nied the being of their Creator; and 
Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, 
could understand them.

18 But it came to pass that Mosiah 
caused that they should be taught 
in  his  a language.  And  it  came  to 
pass that after they were taught in 
the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla 
gave a genealogy of his fathers, ac-
cording  to  his  memory;  and  they 
are written, but b not in these plates.
19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, 
did a unite together; and b Mosiah was 
appointed to be their king.

20 And it came to pass in the days 
of Mosiah, there was a large a stone 
brought unto him with engravings 
on  it;  and  he  did  b interpret  the  
engravings by the gift and power 
of God.

21 And  they  gave  an  account  of 
one  a Coriantumr, and the slain of 
his  people.  And  Coriantumr  was 
discovered by the people of Zara-
hemla; and he dwelt with them for 
the space of nine moons.

22 It also spake a few words con-
cerning  his  fathers.  And  his  first 
parents came out from the a tower, 
at the time the Lord  b confounded 
the language of the people; and the 
severity of the Lord fell upon them 
according to his judgments, which 
are just; and their c bones lay scat-
tered in the land northward.

23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in 
the days of Mosiah; and I have lived 
to see his death; and a Benjamin, b his  
son, reigneth in his stead.

24 And behold, I have seen, in the 
days of king Benjamin, a serious war 
and much bloodshed between the 
Nephites  and  the  Lamanites.  But 
behold,  the  Nephites  did  obtain  
much  advantage  over  them;  yea, 
insomuch that king Benjamin did 
drive them out of the land of Zara-
hemla.

25 And it came to pass that I began  
to be old; and, having no seed, and 
knowing king a Benjamin to be a just 
man before the Lord, wherefore, I 
shall b deliver up c these plates unto 
him,  exhorting  all  men  to  come 
unto God, the Holy One of Israel, 
and believe in prophesying, and in 
revelations, and in the ministering 
of angels, and in the gift of speak-
ing with tongues, and in the gift of 
interpreting languages, and in all 
things which are d good; for there is 
nothing which is good save it comes 
from  the  Lord:  and  that  which  is 
evil cometh from the devil.

26 And now, my beloved brethren, 
I would that ye should a come unto 
Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel,  
and  partake  of  his  salvation,  and 
the power of his redemption. Yea, 
come  unto  him,  and  b offer  your 
whole souls as an c offering unto him,  
and continue in d fasting and pray-
ing, and endure to the end; and as 
the Lord liveth ye will be saved.

27 And now I would speak some-
what concerning a certain a number 
who went up into the wilderness to  
b return  to  the  c land  of  Nephi;  for 
there was a large number who were 
desirous to possess the land of their 
inheritance.

a  stiffnecked  man,  wherefore  he 
caused a contention among them; 
and they were a all slain, save fifty, 
in the wilderness, and they returned 
again to the land of Zarahemla.

29 And it came to pass that they 
also took others to a considerable 

number,  and  took  their  journey 
again into the wilderness.

30 And I, Amaleki, had a brother, 
who  also  went  with  them;  and  I  
have not since known concerning 
them. And I am about to lie down  
in my grave; and a these plates are 
full.  And  I  make  an  end  of  my 
speaking.

The WorDs of MorMon

Mormon abridges the large plates of 
Nephi—He puts the small plates with 
the other plates—King Benjamin es-
tablishes  peace  in  the  land.  About 
a.d. 385.

AND now I, Mormon, being about  

 to deliver up the a record which  
    I have been making into the 
hands of my son Moroni, behold I 
have  witnessed  almost  all  the  de-
struction of my people, the Nephites.
2 And it is a many hundred years  
after the coming of Christ that I de-
liver these records into the hands of 
my son; and it supposeth me that he 
will witness the entire b destruction 
of my people. But may God grant  
that he may survive them, that he  
may  write  somewhat  concerning  
them,  and  somewhat  concerning 
Christ,  that  perhaps  some  day  it 
may c profit them.

3 And now, I speak somewhat con-
cerning that which I have written; 
for after I had made an a abridgment 
from the b plates of Nephi, down to 

the reign of this king Benjamin, of 
whom  Amaleki  spake,  I  searched 
among the c records which had been 
delivered into my hands, and I found 
these plates, which contained this 
small account of the prophets, from 
Jacob down to the reign of this king 
d Benjamin,  and  also  many  of  the 
words of Nephi.

4 And the things which are upon 
these plates a pleasing me, because 
of the prophecies of the coming of 
Christ; and my fathers knowing that 
many of them have been fulfilled; 
yea, and I also know that as many 
things  as  have  been  b prophesied 
concerning  us  down  to  this  day 
have  been  fulfilled,  and  as  many 
as go beyond this day must surely 
come to pass—

5 Wherefore, I chose a these things, 
to  finish  my  b record  upon  them, 
which  remainder  of  my  record  I 
shall take from the c plates of Nephi; 
and I cannot write the d hundredth 
part of the things of my people.

6 But  behold,  I  shall  take  these

plates, which contain these prophe-
syings and revelations, and put them 
with the remainder of my record, 
for they are choice unto me; and I 
know they will be choice unto my 
brethren.

7 And I do this for a a wise b purpose; 
for thus it whispereth me, accord-
ing to the workings of the Spirit of  
the Lord which is in me. And now, 
I  do  not  know  all  things;  but  the 
Lord c knoweth all things which are 
to  come;  wherefore,  he  d worketh 
in me to do according to his e will.
8 And my  a prayer to God is con-
cerning my brethren, that they may 
once again come to the knowledge 
of  God,  yea,  the  redemption  of 
Christ;  that  they  may  once  again 
be a b delightsome people.

9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to 
finish out my record, which I take 
from the plates of Nephi; and I make 
it according to the knowledge and 
the a understanding which God has 
given me.

10 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
after  Amaleki  had  a delivered  up 
these plates into the hands of king 
Benjamin,  he  took  them  and  put 
them with the b other plates, which 
contained records which had been 
handed down by the  c kings, from 
generation to generation until the 
days of king Benjamin.

11 And  they  were  handed  down 
from king Benjamin, from genera-
tion to generation until they have 
fallen into a my hands. And I, Mor-
mon,  pray  to  God  that  they  may 
be preserved from this time hence-
forth.  And  I  know  that  they  will 

be  preserved;  for  there  are  great 
things  written  upon  them,  out  of 
which b my people and their breth-
ren shall be c judged at the great and 
last day, according to the word of 
God which is written.

12 And now, concerning this king 
Benjamin—he  had  somewhat  of 
contentions among his own people.
13 And it came to pass also that 
the armies of the Lamanites came 
down out of the a land of Nephi, to 
battle  against  his  people.  But  be-
hold, king Benjamin gathered to-
gether his armies, and he did stand 
against them; and he did fight with  
the strength of his own arm, with the  
b sword of Laban.

14 And in the a strength of the Lord 
they did contend against their en-
emies,  until  they  had  slain  many 
thousands  of  the  Lamanites.  And 
it came to pass that they did con-
tend  against  the  Lamanites  until 
they had driven them out of all the 
lands of their b inheritance.

15 And it came to pass that after 
there had been false a Christs, and 
their mouths had been shut, and they  
punished according to their crimes;
16 And after there had been a false 
prophets, and false preachers and 
teachers among the people, and all 
these having been punished accord-
ing to their crimes; and after there 
having been much contention and 
many  dissensions  away  b unto  the 
Lamanites, behold, it came to pass 
that  king  Benjamin,  with  the  as-
sistance of the holy c prophets who 
were among his people—

WORDS OF MORMON 1  : 18–MOSIAH 1  : 5

a a holy man, and he did reign over 
his  people  in  righteousness;  and 
there were many holy men in the 
land, and they did speak the word of 
God with b power and with authority; 
and they did use much c sharpness 
because  of  the  stiffneckedness  of 
the people—

18 Wherefore,  with  the  help  of 
these, king a Benjamin, by laboring 
with all the might of his body and 
the b faculty of his whole soul, and 
also  the  prophets,  did  once  more 
establish peace in the land.

The Book of MosiAh

CHAPTER 1

King Benjamin teaches his sons the lan-
guage and prophecies of their fathers—
Their religion and civilization have been 
preserved because of the records kept on 
the various plates—Mosiah is chosen as 
king and is given custody of the records 
and other things. About 130–124 b.c.

AND  now  there  was  no  more  

   contention in all the a land of  
   Zarahemla,  among  all  the 
people who belonged to king Ben-
jamin, so that king Benjamin had 
continual peace all the remainder of  
his days.

2 And it came to pass that he had 
three  a sons;  and  he  called  their 
names  Mosiah,  and  Helorum,  and 
Helaman. And he caused that they 
should  be  b taught  in  all  the  c lan-
guage  of  his  fathers,  that  thereby 
they might become men of under-
standing; and that they might know 
concerning  the  prophecies  which 
had been spoken by the mouths of 
their fathers, which were delivered 
them by the hand of the Lord.

3 And  he  also  taught  them  con-
cerning  the  records  which  were 
engraven on the a plates of brass, say-
ing: My sons, I would that ye should 
remember that were it not for these 
b plates, which contain these records 
and these commandments, we must 
have suffered in c ignorance, even at 
this present time, not knowing the 
mysteries of God.

4 For it were not possible that our 
father, Lehi, could have remembered 
all these things, to have taught them 
to his children, except it were for the 
help of these plates; for he having 
been taught in the a language of the 
Egyptians therefore he could read 
these engravings, and teach them to 
his children, that thereby they could 
teach  them  to  their  children,  and 
so fulfilling the commandments of 
God, even down to this present time.
5 I  say  unto  you,  my  sons,  a were 
it not for these things, which have 
been  kept  and  b preserved  by  the 
hand of God, that we might c read and 
understand of his  d mysteries, and 
have  his  e commandments  always

before  our  eyes,  that  even  our 
fathers  would  have  dwindled  in 
unbelief, and we should have been 
like unto our brethren, the Laman-
ites, who know nothing concerning 
these things, or even do not believe 
them when they are taught them, 
because of the  f traditions of their 
fathers, which are not correct.

6 O my sons, I would that ye should 
remember  that  these  sayings  are 
true,  and  also  that  these  records  
are a true. And behold, also the plates 
of Nephi, which contain the records 
and the sayings of our fathers from 
the time they left Jerusalem until 
now, and they are true; and we can 
know  of  their  surety  because  we 
have them before our eyes.

7 And now, my sons, I would that 
ye  should  remember  to  a search 
them diligently, that ye may profit 
thereby; and I would that ye should 
b keep the commandments of God, 
that  ye  may  c prosper  in  the  land 
according to the  d promises which 
the Lord made unto our fathers.

8 And many more things did king 
Benjamin teach his sons, which are 
not written in this book.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
king  Benjamin  had  made  an  end 
of teaching his sons, that he waxed 
a old, and he saw that he must very 
soon  go  the  way  of  all  the  earth; 
therefore, he thought it expedient 
that he should confer the kingdom 
upon one of his sons.

10 Therefore,  he  had  Mosiah 
brought before him; and these are 
the  words  which  he  spake  unto 
him, saying: My son, I would that 
ye  should  make  a  proclamation 
throughout all this land among all 

this a people, or the people of Zara-
hemla,  and  the  people  of  Mosiah 
who dwell in the land, that thereby 
they may be gathered together; for 
on the morrow I shall proclaim unto 
this  my  people  out  of  mine  own 
mouth that thou art a b king and a 
ruler  over  this  people,  whom  the 
Lord our God hath given us.

11 And moreover, I shall give this 
people a a name, that thereby they 
may be distinguished above all the 
people  which  the  Lord  God  hath 
brought out of the land of Jerusa-
lem; and this I do because they have 
been a b diligent people in keeping 
the commandments of the Lord.

12 And I give unto them a name 
that never shall be blotted out, ex-
cept it be through a transgression.

13 Yea,  and  moreover  I  say  unto 
you,  that  if  this  highly  favored 
people of the Lord should fall into 
a transgression, and become a wicked 
and an adulterous people, that the 
Lord  will  deliver  them  up,  that 
thereby  they  become  b weak  like 
unto their brethren; and he will no 
more c preserve them by his match-
less  and  marvelous  power,  as  he 
has hitherto preserved our fathers.
14 For I say unto you, that if he 
had  not  extended  his  arm  in  the 
preservation  of  our  fathers  they 
must have fallen into the hands of 
the Lamanites, and become victims 
to their hatred.

15 And it came to pass that after 
king  Benjamin  had  made  an  end 
of these sayings to his son, that he 
gave  him  a charge  concerning  all 
the affairs of the kingdom.

16 And moreover, he also gave him 
charge concerning the records which

were  engraven  on  the  a plates  of 
brass; and also the plates of Nephi; 
and also, the b sword of Laban, and 
the c ball or director, which led our 
fathers  through  the  wilderness, 
which was prepared by the hand of 
the Lord that thereby they might 
be led, every one according to the 
heed and diligence which they gave 
unto him.

17 Therefore, as they were a unfaith-
ful they did not prosper nor progress  
in their journey, but were b driven 
back, and incurred the displeasure 
of  God  upon  them;  and  therefore 
they were smitten with famine and 
sore c afflictions, to stir them up in 
d remembrance of their duty.

18 And now, it came to pass that 
Mosiah went and did as his father 
had  commanded  him,  and  pro-
claimed  unto  all  the  people  who 
were in the land of Zarahemla that 
thereby  they  might  gather  them-
selves  together,  to  go  up  to  the 
a temple  to  hear  the  words  which 
his father should speak unto them.

CHAPTER 2
King Benjamin addresses his people—He  
recounts the equity, fairness, and spiri-
tuality of his reign—He counsels them to 
serve their Heavenly King—Those who 
rebel against God will suffer anguish 
like unquenchable fire. About 124 b.c.
And it came to pass that after Mo-
siah  had  done  as  his  father  had 
commanded  him,  and  had  made 
a proclamation throughout all the 
land,  that  the  people  a gathered 
themselves  together  throughout 
all the land, that they might go up 

to the b temple to c hear the d words 
which king Benjamin should speak 
unto them.

2 And there were a great number, 
even  so  many  that  they  did  not 
number them; for they had multi-
plied exceedingly and waxed great 
in the land.

3 And they also took of the a first-
lings of their flocks, that they might 
offer b sacrifice and c burnt d offerings 
e according to the law of Moses;

4 And  also  that  they  might  give 
thanks to the Lord their God, who 
had brought them out of the land 
of Jerusalem, and who had deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their 
enemies, and had  a appointed just 
men to be their b teachers, and also 
a  just  man  to  be  their  king,  who 
had established peace in the c land 
of Zarahemla, and who had taught 
them to d keep the commandments 
of God, that they might rejoice and 
be  filled  with  e love  towards  God 
and all men.

5 And it came to pass that when 
they came up to the temple, they 
pitched  their  tents  round  about,  
every man according to his a fami ly, 
consisting  of  his  wife,  and  his  
sons, and his daughters, and their 
sons,  and  their  daughters,  from 
the  eldest  down  to  the  youngest, 
every  family  being  separate  one 
from another.

6 And  they  pitched  their  tents 
round about the temple, every man  
having his a tent with the door there-
of towards the temple, that thereby 
they  might  remain  in  their  tents 
and  hear  the  words  which  king 
Benjamin should speak unto them;

7 For the multitude being so great 
that king Benjamin could not teach 
them  all  within  the  walls  of  the 
temple, therefore he caused a a tower 
to be erected, that thereby his peo-
ple might hear the words which he 
should speak unto them.

8 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to speak to his people from the 
tower; and they could not all hear 
his words because of the greatness  
of the multitude; therefore he caused 
that  the  words  which  he  spake 
should  be  written  and  sent  forth  
among those that were not under the  
sound of his voice, that they might 
also receive his words.

9 And these are the words which 
he a spake and caused to be written, 
saying: My brethren, all ye that have 
assembled yourselves together, you 
that  can  hear  my  words  which  I 
shall speak unto you this day; for I 
have not commanded you to come  
up hither to b trifle with the words 
which  I  shall  speak,  but  that  you 
should c hearken unto me, and open 
your ears that ye may hear, and your 
d hearts that ye may understand, and 
your e minds that the f mysteries of 
God may be unfolded to your view.
10 I have not commanded you to 
come up hither that ye should fear 
a me, or that ye should think that I of 
myself am more than a mortal man.
11 But  I  am  like  as  yourselves, 
subject to all manner of infirmities 
in body and mind; yet I have been 
chosen by this people, and a conse-
crated by b my father, and was suf-
fered by the hand of the Lord that 
I should be a ruler and a king over 
this people; and have been kept and 
preserved by his matchless power, to 

serve you with all the might, mind 
and strength which the Lord hath 
granted unto me.

12 I  say  unto  you  that  as  I  have 
been suffered to a spend my days in 
your service, even up to this time, 
and have not sought b gold nor silver 
nor any manner of riches of you;

13 Neither have I suffered that ye 
should  be  confined  in  dungeons, 
nor that ye should make slaves one 
of another, nor that ye should mur-
der, or plunder, or steal, or commit 
adultery; nor even have I suffered 
that ye should commit any manner 
of wickedness, and have taught you 
that ye should keep the command-
ments  of  the  Lord,  in  all  things 
which he hath commanded you—
14 And  even  I,  myself,  have  a la-
bored with mine own b hands that I 
might serve you, and that ye should 
not be c laden with taxes, and that 
there should nothing come upon you 
which was grievous to be borne—
and of all these things which I have 
spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses 
this day.

15 Yet,  my  brethren,  I  have  not 
done  these  things  that  I  might 
a boast, neither do I tell these things 
that  thereby  I  might  accuse  you; 
but I tell you these things that ye 
may know that I can answer a clear 
b conscience before God this day.

16 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  that 
because I said unto you that I had 
spent my days in your service, I do 
not desire to boast, for I have only 
been in the service of God.

17 And  behold,  I  tell  you  these 
things that ye may learn a wisdom; 
that ye may learn that when ye are 
in the b service of your c fellow beings

MOSIAH 2  : 18–28

ye are only in the service of your  
God.

18 Behold, ye have called me your 
king; and if  I, whom ye call your king,  
do labor to a serve you, then ought 
not ye to labor to serve one another?
19 And  behold  also,  if  I,  whom 
ye  call  your  king,  who  has  spent 
his  days  in  your  service,  and  yet 
has been in the service of God, do 
merit any thanks from you, O how 
you ought to a thank your heavenly 
b King!

20 I say unto you, my brethren, that  
if you should render all the a thanks 
and b praise which your whole soul 
has power to possess, to that God 
who has created you, and has kept 
and c preserved you, and has caused 
that  ye  should  d rejoice,  and  has 
granted that ye should live in peace 
one with another—

21 I say unto you that if ye should 
a serve  him  who  has  created  you 
from  the  beginning,  and  is  b pre-
serving  you  from  day  to  day,  by 
lending  you  c breath,  that  ye  may 
live and move and do according to 
your own d will, and even supporting 
you from one moment to another—I 
say, if ye should serve him with all 
your e whole souls yet ye would be 
f unprofitable servants.

22 And  behold,  all  that  he  a re-
quires of you is to  b keep his com-
mandments; and he has c promised 
you that if ye would keep his com-
mandments ye should prosper in the 
land; and he never doth d vary from 
that which he hath said; therefore, 

if ye do e keep his f commandments 
he doth bless you and prosper you.
23 And now, in the first place, he 
hath created you, and granted unto 
you your lives, for which ye are in-
debted unto him.

24 And secondly, he doth a require 
that ye should do as he hath com-
manded you; for which if ye do, he 
doth immediately  b bless you; and 
therefore  he  hath  paid  you.  And 
ye are still indebted unto him, and 
are, and will be, forever and ever; 
therefore, of what have ye to boast?
25 And now I ask, can ye say aught 
of  yourselves?  I  answer  you,  Nay. 
Ye cannot say that ye are even as 
much as the dust of the earth; yet 
ye were a created of the b dust of the 
earth; but behold, it c belongeth to 
him who created you.

26 And  I,  even  I,  whom  ye  call 
your  king,  am  a no  better  than  ye 
yourselves are; for I am also of the 
dust. And ye behold that I am old, 
and am about to yield up this mor-
tal frame to its mother earth.

27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I 
had a served you, b walking with a clear 
conscience before God, even so I at 
this time have caused that ye should 
assemble yourselves together, that I 
might be found blameless, and that 
your  c blood should not come upon 
me, when I shall stand to be judged 
of God of the things whereof he hath 
commanded me concerning you.

28 I  say  unto  you  that  I  have 
caused  that  ye  should  assemble 
yourselves  together  that  I  might

150

a rid  my  garments  of  your  blood, 
at  this  period  of  time  when  I  am 
about to go down to my grave, that 
I might go down in peace, and my 
immortal b spirit may join the c choirs 
above  in  singing  the  praises  of  a  
just God.

29 And moreover, I say unto you 
that I have caused that ye should 
assemble yourselves together, that 
I  might  declare  unto  you  that  I 
can no longer be your teacher, nor 
your king;

30 For even at this time, my whole 
frame  doth  tremble  exceedingly 
while  attempting  to  speak  unto 
you;  but  the  Lord  God  doth  sup-
port me, and hath suffered me that 
I should speak unto you, and hath 
commanded me that I should de-
clare  unto  you  this  day,  that  my 
son Mosiah is a  a king and a ruler 
over you.

31 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should do as ye have hitherto 
done. As ye have kept my command-
ments, and also the commandments 
of my father, and have prospered, 
and have been kept from falling into 
the hands of your enemies, even so 
if ye shall keep the commandments 
of my son, or the commandments of 
God which shall be delivered unto 
you by him, ye shall prosper in the 
land, and your enemies shall have 
no power over you.

32 But, O my people, beware lest 
there shall arise a contentions among 
you, and ye  b list to  c obey the evil 
spirit, which was spoken of by my 
father Mosiah.

33 For behold, there is a wo pro-
nounced upon him who listeth to 

a obey  that  spirit;  for  if  he  listeth 
to  obey  him,  and  remaineth  and 
dieth  in  his  b sins,  the  same  drin-
keth  c damnation  to  his  own  soul; 
for  he  receiveth  for  his  wages  an 
d everlasting  e punishment,  having 
transgressed  the  law  of  God  con-
trary to his own knowledge.

34 I say unto you, that there are not 
any among you, except it be your 
little children that have not been 
taught concerning these things, but 
what knoweth that ye are eternally 
a indebted to your heavenly Father, 
to render to him b all that you have 
and are; and also have been taught 
concerning the c records which con-
tain the prophecies which have been 
spoken by the holy prophets, even 
down to the time our father, Lehi, 
left Jerusalem;

35 And  also,  all  that  has  been 
spoken  by  our  fathers  until  now. 
And behold, also, they spake that 
which  was  commanded  them  of 
the Lord; therefore, they are  a just  
and true.

36 And  now,  I  say  unto  you,  my 
brethren, that after ye have known 
and  have  been  taught  all  these 
things, if ye should transgress and 
go a contrary to that which has been 
spoken, that ye do b withdraw your-
selves from the Spirit of the Lord, 
that it may have no place in you to 
guide  you  in  wisdom’s  paths  that 
ye may be blessed, prospered, and 
preserved—

37 I say unto you, that the man that  
doeth this, the same cometh out in 
open a rebellion against God; there-
fore  he  b listeth  to  obey  the  evil  
spirit, and becometh an enemy to

all righteousness; therefore, the Lord  
has no place in him, for he dwelleth  
not in c unholy temples.

38 Therefore  if  that  man  a re-
penteth not, and remaineth and di-
eth an enemy to God, the demands 
of  divine  b justice  do  awaken  his 
immortal soul to a lively sense of 
his  own  c guilt,  which  doth  cause 
him to shrink from the  d presence 
of the Lord, and doth fill his breast 
with guilt, and e pain, and f anguish, 
which is like an unquenchable g fire, 
whose flame ascendeth up forever  
and ever.

39 And now I say unto you, that 
a mercy hath no claim on that man; 
therefore his final doom is to endure 
a never-ending b torment.

40 O, all ye a old men, and also ye 
young men, and you little children 
who can understand my words, for 
I have spoken plainly unto you that 
ye might understand, I pray that ye 
should  awake  to  a  b remembrance 
of the awful situation of those that 
have fallen into transgression.

41 And moreover, I would desire 
that  ye  should  consider  on  the  
blessed and  a happy state of those 
that  keep  the  commandments  of 
God. For behold, they are b blessed 
in  all  things,  both  temporal  and  
spiritual; and if they hold out c faith-
ful  to  the  end  they  are  received 
into  d heaven,  that  thereby  they 
may dwell with God in a state of 
never-ending happiness. O remem-
ber,  remember  that  these  things 
are  true;  for  the  Lord  God  hath  
spoken it.

CHAPTER 3

King Benjamin continues his address—
The  Lord  Omnipotent  will  minister 
among men in a tabernacle of clay—
Blood will come from every pore as He 
atones for the sins of the world—His 
is  the  only  name  whereby  salvation 
comes—Men  can  put  off  the  natural 
man  and  become  Saints  through  the 
Atonement—The torment of the wicked 
will be as a lake of fire and brimstone. 
About 124 b.c.
And again my brethren, I would call 
your attention, for I have somewhat 
more to speak unto you; for behold, 
I have things to tell you concerning 
that which is to come.

2 And the things which I shall tell 
you are made known unto me by 
an  a angel  from  God.  And  he  said 
unto me: b Awake; and I awoke, and 
behold he stood before me.

3 And  he  said  unto  me:  Awake, 
and hear the words which I shall 
tell thee; for behold, I am come to 
declare unto you the a glad tidings 
of great b joy.

4 For  the  Lord  hath  heard  thy 
prayers,  and  hath  judged  of  thy 
a righteousness, and hath sent me to 
declare  unto  thee  that  thou  may-
est  rejoice;  and  that  thou  mayest 
declare unto thy people, that they 
may also be filled with joy.

5 For  behold,  the  time  cometh, 
and  is  not  far  distant,  that  with 
power, the a Lord b Omnipotent who 
c reigneth,  who  was,  and  is  from 
all  d eternity  to  all  eternity,  shall 
come down from heaven among the

children of men, and shall dwell in 
a e tabernacle of clay, and shall go 
forth amongst men, working mighty 
f miracles, such as healing the sick, 
raising the dead, causing the lame 
to walk, the g blind to receive their 
sight, and the deaf to hear, and cur-
ing all manner of diseases.

6 And he shall cast out a devils, or 
the b evil spirits which dwell in the 
hearts of the children of men.

7 And lo, he shall  a suffer  b temp-
tations, and pain of body, c hunger, 
thirst, and fatigue, even more than 
man can d suffer, except it be unto 
death;  for  behold,  e blood  cometh 
from every pore, so great shall be 
his f anguish for the wickedness and 
the abominations of his people.

8 And  he  shall  be  called  a Jesus 
b Christ, the c Son of God, the d Father 
of heaven and earth, the e Creator of 
all things from the beginning; and 
his f mother shall be called Mary.

9 And lo, he cometh unto his own, 
that  a salvation  might  come  unto 
the children of men even through 
b faith on his name; and even after 
all this they shall consider him a 
man, and say that he hath a c devil, 

and shall  d scourge him, and shall  
e crucify him.

10 And  he  shall  a rise  the  b third 
day from the dead; and behold, he 
standeth to  c judge the world; and 
behold,  all  these  things  are  done 
that  a  righteous  judgment  might 
come upon the children of men.

11 For behold, and also his a blood 
b atoneth for the sins of those who 
have c fallen by the transgression of 
Adam, who have died not knowing 
the d will of God concerning them, 
or who have e ignorantly sinned.

12 But  wo,  wo  unto  him  who 
knoweth that he a rebelleth against 
God! For salvation cometh to none 
such  except  it  be  through  repen-
tance and faith on the b Lord Jesus 
Christ.

13 And the Lord God hath sent his 
holy a prophets among all the chil-
dren of men, to declare these things 
to every kindred, nation, and tongue, 
that thereby whosoever should be-
lieve that Christ should come, the 
same  might  receive  b remission  of 
their sins, and rejoice with exceed-
ingly  great  joy,  even  c as  though  
he had already come among them.

MOSIAH 3  : 14–22

14 Yet the Lord God saw that his 
people were a a stiffnecked people, 
and he appointed unto them a b law, 
even the c law of Moses.

15 And many signs, and wonders, 
and a types, and shadows showed he 
unto them, concerning his coming; 
and also holy prophets spake unto 
them concerning his coming; and 
yet  they  b hardened  their  hearts, 
and  understood  not  that  the  c law 
of Moses availeth nothing  d except 
it were through the e atonement of 
his blood.

16 And  even  if  it  were  possible 
that little a children could sin they 
could not be saved; but I say unto 
you they are  b blessed; for behold, 
as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, 
even so the blood of Christ c atoneth 
for their sins.

17 And moreover, I say unto you, 
that there shall be a no other name 
given nor any other way nor means 
whereby b salvation can come unto 
the  children  of  men,  only  in  and 
through  the  name  of  Christ,  the 
c Lord Omnipotent.

18 For  behold  he  judgeth,  and  
his  judgment  is  just;  and  the  in-
fant  perisheth  not  that  dieth  in 
his infancy; but men drink  a dam-
nation  to  their  own  souls  except 
they  humble  themselves  and  b be-

come  as  little  children,  and  be-
lieve  that  c salvation  was,  and  is, 
and is to come, in and through the 
d atoning blood of Christ, the Lord  
Omnipotent.

19 For  the  a natural  b man  is  an 
c enemy to God, and has been from 
the d fall of Adam, and will be, for-
ever and ever, unless he e yields to 
the  enticings  of  the  f  Holy  Spirit, 
and g putteth off the h natural man 
and becometh a i saint through the 
atonement of Christ the Lord, and 
becometh as a j child, k submissive, 
meek, humble, patient, full of love, 
willing to submit to all things which 
the  Lord  seeth  fit  to  inflict  upon 
him,  even  as  a  child  doth  submit 
to his father.

20 And moreover, I say unto you, 
that the time shall come when the 
a knowledge of a b Savior shall spread 
throughout c every nation, kindred, 
tongue, and people.

21 And  behold,  when  that  time 
cometh, none shall be found a blame-
less before God, except it be little 
children, only through repentance 
and faith on the name of the Lord 
God Omnipotent.

22 And  even  at  this  time,  when 
thou shalt have taught thy people 
the things which the Lord thy God 
hath commanded thee, even then

are they found no more blameless 
in the sight of God, only according 
to the words which I have spoken 
unto thee.

23 And  now  I  have  spoken  the 
words  which  the  Lord  God  hath 
commanded me.

24 And thus saith the Lord: They 
shall  stand  as  a  bright  testimony 
against this people, at the judgment 
day; whereof they shall be judged, 
every man according to his a works, 
whether they be good, or whether 
they be evil.

25 And  if  they  be  evil  they  are 
consigned to an awful a view of their 
own guilt and abominations, which 
doth cause them to shrink from the 
presence of the Lord into a state of 
b misery and c endless torment, from 
whence they can no more return; 
therefore they have drunk damna-
tion to their own souls.

26 Therefore, they have drunk out 
of  the  a cup  of  the  wrath  of  God, 
which justice could no more deny 
unto them than it could deny that 
b Adam  should  fall  because  of  his 
partaking  of  the  forbidden  c fruit; 
therefore, d mercy could have claim 
on them no more forever.

27 And their a torment is as a b lake 
of fire and brimstone, whose flames 
are unquenchable, and whose smoke 
ascendeth  up  c forever  and  ever. 
Thus  hath  the  Lord  commanded 
me. Amen.

CHAPTER 4
King Benjamin continues his address—
Salvation comes because of the Atonement 
—Believe in God to be saved—Retain 

a remission of your sins through faith-
fulness—Impart  of  your  substance  to 
the poor—Do all things in wisdom and 
order. About 124 b.c.

And now, it came to pass that when 
king  Benjamin  had  made  an  end 
of speaking the words which had 
been  delivered  unto  him  by  the 
a angel of the Lord, that he cast his 
eyes round about on the multitude, 
and behold they had b fallen to the 
earth, for the c fear of the Lord had 
come upon them.

2 And they had a viewed themselves  
in their own b carnal state, even c less  
than the dust of the earth. And they 
all cried aloud with one voice, say-
ing: O have mercy, and apply the 
d atoning blood of Christ that we may  
receive forgiveness of our sins, and 
our hearts may be e purified; for we 
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, who f created heaven and earth, 
and all things; who shall come down 
among the children of men.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  af-
ter  they  had  spoken  these  words 
the  Spirit  of  the  Lord  came  upon 
them,  and  they  were  filled  with 
joy,  having  received  a  a remission 
of their sins, and having peace of 
b conscience, because of the exceed-
ing c faith which they had in Jesus 
Christ who should come, according 
to the d words which king Benjamin 
had spoken unto them.

4 And king Benjamin again opened 
his  mouth  and  began  to  speak 
unto them, saying: My friends and 
my brethren, my kindred and my 
people,  I  would  again  call  your 
attention,  that  ye  may  hear  and

MOSIAH 4  : 5–13

understand  the  remainder  of  my 
words which I shall speak unto you.
5 For behold, if the knowledge of 
the goodness of God at this time has 
awakened  you  to  a  sense  of  your 
a nothingness,  and  your  worthless 
and fallen state—

6 I say unto you, if ye have come 
to a a knowledge of the goodness of 
God, and his matchless power, and 
his wisdom, and his patience, and his 
long-suffering towards the children  
of  men;  and  also,  the  b atonement 
which has been prepared from the 
c foundation of the world, that thereby 
salvation  might  come  to  him  that 
should  put  his  d trust  in  the  Lord, 
and should be diligent in keeping his 
commandments, and continue in the 
faith even unto the end of his life, I 
mean the life of the mortal body—
7 I say, that this is the man who 
receiveth  salvation,  through  the 
atonement  which  was  prepared 
from the foundation of the world for 
all mankind, which ever were since 
the a fall of Adam, or who are, or who 
ever shall be, even unto the end of  
the world.

8 And this is the means whereby 
salvation cometh. And there is a none 
other salvation save this which hath 
been spoken of; neither are there 
any conditions whereby man can be 
saved except the conditions which 
I have told you.

9 Believe in a God; believe that he 
is, and that he b created all things, 
both in heaven and in earth; believe  
that  he  has  all  c wisdom,  and  all 
power, both in heaven and in earth; 

believe that man doth not d compre-
hend all the things which the Lord 
can comprehend.

10 And again, believe that ye must 
a repent  of  your  sins  and  forsake 
them,  and  humble  yourselves  be-
fore God; and ask in  b sincerity of 
heart  that  he  would  c forgive  you; 
and now, if you  d believe all these 
things see that ye e do them.

11 And again I say unto you as I 
have  said  before,  that  as  ye  have 
come to the knowledge of the glory 
of God, or if ye have known of his 
goodness  and  have  a tasted  of  his 
love,  and  have  received  a  b remis-
sion  of  your  sins,  which  causeth 
such exceedingly great joy in your 
souls, even so I would that ye should 
remember, and always retain in re-
membrance, the greatness of God, 
and  your  own  c nothingness,  and 
his  d goodness  and  long-suffering 
towards you, unworthy creatures, 
and humble yourselves even in the 
depths of e humility, f calling on the 
name of the Lord daily, and stand-
ing g steadfastly in the faith of that 
which is to come, which was spoken 
by the mouth of the angel.

12 And behold, I say unto you that 
if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, 
and be filled with the a love of God, 
and always  b retain a remission of 
your sins; and ye shall grow in the 
c knowledge of the glory of him that 
created you, or in the knowledge of 
that which is just and true.

13 And ye will not have a a mind 
to  injure  one  another,  but  to  live 
b peaceably, and to render to every

man  according  to  that  which  is 
his due.

14 And  ye  will  not  suffer  your 
a children  that  they  go  hungry,  or 
naked; neither will ye b suffer that 
they transgress the laws of God, and 
fight and c quarrel one with another, 
and serve the devil, who is the mas-
ter of sin, or who is the d evil spirit 
which hath been spoken of by our 
fathers, he being an enemy to all 
righteousness.

15 But ye will a teach them to b walk 
in the ways of truth and c soberness; 
ye will teach them to d love one an-
other, and to serve one another.

16 And  also,  ye  yourselves  will 
a succor those that stand in need of  
your  succor;  ye  will  administer  
of  your  substance  unto  him  that 
standeth in need; and ye will not 
suffer that the b beggar putteth up 
his petition to you in vain, and turn 
him out to perish.

17 Perhaps  thou  shalt  a say:  The 
man has brought upon himself his 
misery;  therefore  I  will  stay  my 
hand, and will not give unto him 
of my food, nor impart unto him of 
my substance that he may not suf-
fer, for his punishments are just—
18 But  I  say  unto  you,  O  man, 
whosoever doeth this the same hath 
great  cause  to  repent;  and  except 
he repenteth of that which he hath 
done he perisheth forever, and hath 
no interest in the kingdom of God.
19 For behold, are we not all a beg-
gars?  Do  we  not  all  depend  upon 
the same Being, even God, for all 
the substance which we have, for 
both food and raiment, and for gold, 

and for silver, and for all the riches 
which we have of every kind?

20 And behold, even at this time, 
ye have been calling on his name, 
and begging for a a remission of your 
sins.  And  has  he  suffered  that  ye 
have begged in vain? Nay; he has 
poured out his b Spirit upon you, and 
has caused that your hearts should 
be filled with c joy, and has caused 
that your mouths should be stopped 
that  ye  could  not  find  utterance, 
so exceedingly great was your joy.
21 And now, if God, who has cre-
ated you, on whom you are depen-
dent for your lives and for all that 
ye  have  and  are,  doth  grant  unto 
you whatsoever ye ask that is right, 
in faith, believing that ye shall re-
ceive, O then, how ye ought to a im-
part of the substance that ye have 
one to another.

22 And if ye a judge the man who 
putteth up his petition to you for 
your substance that he perish not, 
and condemn him, how much more 
just will be your b condemnation for 
withholding your substance, which 
doth not belong to you but to God, 
to whom also your life c belongeth; 
and yet ye put up no petition, nor 
repent  of  the  thing  which  thou  
hast done.

23 I say unto you, wo be unto that 
man, for his substance shall perish 
with him; and now, I say these things 
unto  those  who  are  a rich  as  per-
taining to the things of this world.
24 And again, I say unto the poor, 
ye who have not and yet have suf-
ficient,  that  ye  remain  from  day 
to  day;  I  mean  all  you  who  deny

the beggar, because ye have not; I 
would  that  ye  say  in  your  hearts 
that: I a give not because I b have not, 
but if I had I would c give.

25 And now, if ye say this in your 
hearts  ye  remain  guiltless,  other-
wise ye are a condemned; and your 
condemnation is just for ye covet 
that which ye have not received.

26 And now, for the sake of these 
things  which  I  have  spoken  unto 
you—that is, for the sake of retain-
ing a remission of your sins from 
day to day, that ye may a walk guilt-
less  before  God—I  would  that  ye 
should  b impart  of  your  substance 
to  the  c poor,  every  man  accord-
ing to that which he hath, such as 
d feeding the hungry, clothing the 
naked, visiting the sick and admin-
istering to their relief, both spiri-
tually and temporally, according to  
their wants.

27 And see that all these things are 
done in wisdom and  a order; for it 
is not requisite that a man should 
run  b faster  than  he  has  strength. 
And again, it is expedient that he 
should be diligent, that thereby he 
might win the prize; therefore, all 
things must be done in order.

28 And  I  would  that  ye  should 
remember, that whosoever among  
you  a borroweth  of  his  neighbor 
should  return  the  thing  that  he 
borroweth,  according  as  he  doth 
agree,  or  else  thou  shalt  commit 
sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause 
thy neighbor to commit sin also.

29 And finally, I cannot tell you all 
the things whereby ye may commit 
sin; for there are divers ways and 
means, even so many that I cannot 
number them.

30 But this much I can tell you, that 
if ye do not a watch yourselves, and  
your  b thoughts,  and  your  c words,  
and your deeds, and observe the com-
mandments of God, and d continue  
in the faith of what ye have heard 
concerning the coming of our Lord, 
even  unto  the  end  of  your  lives, 
ye must perish. And now, O man,  
remember, and perish not.

CHAPTER 5
The Saints become the sons and daugh-
ters of Christ through faith—They are 
then called by the name of Christ—King 
Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast 
and immovable in good works. About 
124 b.c.

And now, it came to pass that when 
king Benjamin had thus spoken to 
his  people,  he  sent  among  them, 
desiring  to  know  of  his  people  if 
they a believed the words which he 
had spoken unto them.

2 And they all cried with one voice, 
saying: Yea, we believe all the words 
which  thou  hast  spoken  unto  us; 
and also, we know of their surety 
and truth, because of the Spirit of 
the  Lord  Omnipotent,  which  has 
wrought  a  mighty  a change  in  us, 
or  in  our  hearts,  that  we  have  no 
more disposition to do b evil, but to 
do good continually.

3 And we, ourselves, also, through 
the infinite a goodness of God, and 
the  manifestations  of  his  Spirit, 
have great views of that which is 
to come; and were it expedient, we 
could prophesy of all things.

4 And it is the faith which we have 
had on the things which our king  
has spoken unto us that has brought

us to this great knowledge, whereby 
we do rejoice with such exceedingly 
great joy.

5 And we are willing to enter into 
a a covenant with our God to do his 
will, and to be obedient to his com-
mandments  in  all  things  that  he 
shall command us, all the remainder 
of our days, that we may not bring 
upon  ourselves  a  b never-ending  
torment, as has been spoken by the 
c angel, that we may not drink out 
of the cup of the wrath of God.

6 And  now,  these  are  the  words 
which  king  Benjamin  desired  of 
them;  and  therefore  he  said  unto 
them:  Ye  have  spoken  the  words 
that  I  desired;  and  the  covenant 
which ye have made is a righteous 
covenant.

7 And  now,  because  of  the  cov-
enant which ye have made ye shall 
be  called  the  a children  of  Christ, 
his sons, and his daughters; for be-
hold,  this  day  he  hath  spiritually 
begotten you; for ye say that your 
hearts are b changed through faith 
on his name; therefore, ye are c born 
of him and have become his d sons 
and his daughters.

8 And under this head ye are made 
a free, and there is  b no other head 
whereby ye can be made free. There 
is  no  other  c name  given  whereby 
salvation cometh; therefore, I would 
that ye should d take upon you the 
name  of  Christ,  all  you  that  have 
entered into the covenant with God 
that ye should be obedient unto the 
end of your lives.

9 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
whosoever doeth this shall be found 
at  the  right  hand  of  God,  for  he 

shall know the name by which he 
is called; for he shall be called by 
the name of Christ.

10 And now it shall come to pass, 
that whosoever shall not take upon 
him  the  name  of  Christ  must  be 
called by some a other name; there-
fore, he findeth himself on the b left 
hand of God.

11 And I would that ye should re-
member also, that this is the a name 
that I said I should give unto you 
that  never  should  be  blotted  out, 
except it be through transgression; 
therefore, take heed that ye do not 
transgress,  that  the  name  be  not 
blotted out of your hearts.

12 I  say  unto  you,  I  would  that 
ye should remember to a retain the 
name written always in your hearts, 
that  ye  are  not  found  on  the  left 
hand of God, but that ye hear and 
know the voice by which ye shall 
be  called,  and  also,  the  name  by 
which he shall call you.

13 For  how  a knoweth  a  man  the 
master  whom  he  has  not  served, 
and  who  is  a  stranger  unto  him, 
and  is  far  from  the  thoughts  and 
intents of his heart?

14 And again, doth a man take an 
ass which belongeth to his neigh-
bor, and keep him? I say unto you, 
Nay; he will not even suffer that he 
shall feed among his flocks, but will 
drive him away, and cast him out. 
I say unto you, that even so shall it 
be among you if ye know not the 
name by which ye are called.

15 Therefore, I would that ye should  
be steadfast and immovable, always  
abounding  in  a good  works,  that

may c seal you his, that you may be 
brought to heaven, that ye may have 
everlasting  salvation  and  eternal  
life, through the wisdom, and power, 
and justice, and mercy of him who

CHAPTER 6

King  Benjamin  records  the  names  of 
the people and appoints priests to teach 
them—Mosiah  reigns  as  a  righteous 
king. About 124–121 b.c.
And now, king Benjamin thought 
it was expedient, after having fin-
ished speaking to the people, that 
he  should  a take  the  names  of  all 
those who had entered into a cov-
enant  with  God  to  keep  his  com-
mandments.

2 And it came to pass that there 
was not one soul, except it were little 
children, but who had entered into 
the covenant and had taken upon 
them the name of Christ.

3 And again, it came to pass that 
when king Benjamin had made an 
end  of  all  these  things,  and  had 
consecrated his son a Mosiah to be 
a ruler and a king over his people, 
and had given him all the charges 
concerning the kingdom, and also 
had  b appointed  c priests  to  d teach 
the people, that thereby they might 
hear and know the commandments 
of God, and to stir them up in re-
membrance of the e oath which they 
had made, he dismissed the multi-
tude, and they returned, every one, 
according to their f families, to their 
own houses.

4 And  Mosiah  began  to  reign  in 
his father’s stead. And he began to 
reign  in  the  thirtieth  year  of  his 
age,  making  in  the  whole,  about 
four  hundred  and  seventy-six 

years from the a time that Lehi left  
Jerusalem.

5 And king Benjamin lived three 

years and he died.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Mosiah did a walk in the ways of the 
Lord, and did observe his judgments 
and his statutes, and did keep his 
commandments in all things what-
soever he commanded him.

7 And king Mosiah did cause his 
people  that  they  should  till  the 
earth. And he also, himself, did till 
the earth, that thereby he might a not 
become burdensome to his people, 
that he might do according to that 
which  his  father  had  done  in  all 
things. And there was no conten-
tion  among  all  his  people  for  the 
space of three years.

CHAPTER 7
Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi, 
where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are 
in bondage to the Lamanites—Limhi 
recounts their history—A prophet (Abin-
adi) had testified that Christ is the God 
and Father of all things—Those who 
sow filthiness reap the whirlwind, and 
those who put their trust in the Lord 
will be delivered. About 121 b.c.
And now, it came to pass that af-
ter king Mosiah had had continual 
peace for the space of three years, 
he was desirous to know concerning 
the people who a went up to dwell 
in  the  land  of  b Lehi-Nephi,  or  in 
the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his peo-
ple had heard nothing from them 
from the time they left the land of 
c Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied 
him with their teasings.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Mosiah granted that sixteen of their 
strong men might go up to the land 
of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concern-
ing their brethren.

3 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they started to go up, hav-
ing with them one a Ammon, he be-
ing a strong and mighty man, and 
a  b descendant  of  Zarahemla;  and 
he was also their leader.

4 And  now,  they  knew  not  the 
course  they  should  travel  in  the 
wilderness to go up to the land of 
Lehi-Nephi;  therefore  they  wan-
dered many days in the wilderness, 
even a forty days did they wander.
5 And when they had wandered 
forty days they came to a a hill, which 
is north of the land of b Shilom, and 
there they pitched their tents.

6 And  a Ammon took three of his 
brethren,  and  their  names  were 
Amaleki,  Helem,  and  Hem,  and 
they  went  down  into  the  land  of  
b Nephi.

7 And behold, they met the king of 
the people who were in the land of 
Nephi, and in the land of a Shilom; 
and they were surrounded by the 
king’s guard, and were b taken, and 
were c bound, and were committed 
to d prison.

8 And it came to pass when they 
had been in prison two days they 
were again brought before the king, 
and their bands were loosed; and 
they stood before the king, and were 
permitted, or rather a commanded, 
that they should answer the ques-
tions which he should ask them.

9 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I am a Limhi, the son of Noah, who 
was  the  son  of  Zeniff,  who  came 
up  out  of  the  b land  of  Zarahemla 
to  inherit  this  land,  which  was 
the land of their fathers, who was 
made a  c king by the  d voice of the  
people.

10 And now, a I desire to know the 
cause whereby ye were so bold as 
to come near the walls of the city, 
when I, myself, was with my guards 
without the b gate?

11 And  now,  for  this  cause  have 
I  suffered  that  ye  should  be  pre-
served, that I might inquire of you, 
or  else  I  should  have  caused  that 
my guards should have put you to 
death. Ye are permitted to speak.

12 And  now,  when  Ammon  saw 
that  he  was  permitted  to  speak, 
he went forth and a bowed himself 
before  the  king;  and  rising  again 
he said: O king, I am very thankful 
before God this day that I am yet 
alive, and am permitted to speak; 
and I will endeavor to speak with 
boldness;

13 For I am assured that if ye had 
known me ye would not have suf-
fered that I should have worn these 
bands.  For  I  am  Ammon,  and  am 
a  a descendant  of  Zarahemla,  and 
have come up out of the  b land of 
Zarahemla  to  inquire  concerning 
our brethren, whom c Zeniff brought 
up out of that land.

14 And now, it came to pass that 
after Limhi had heard the words of 
Ammon, he was exceedingly a glad, 
and said: Now, I know of a surety 
that my brethren who were in the 
land  of  Zarahemla  are  b yet  alive. 
And now, I will rejoice; and on the 
morrow I will cause that my people 
shall rejoice also.

15 For behold, we are in bondage 
to  the  Lamanites,  and  are  a taxed 
with  a  tax  which  is  grievous  to 
be  borne.  And  now,  behold,  our 
brethren will deliver us out of our 
b bondage, or out of the hands of the

Lamanites,  and  we  will  be  their 
c slaves;  for  it  is  better  that  we  be 
slaves to the Nephites than to pay 
tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
16 And now, king Limhi command-
ed his guards that they should no  
more bind Ammon nor his brethren,  
but caused that they should go to 
the hill which was north of Shilom, 
and bring their brethren into the 
city,  that  thereby  they  might  eat, 
and drink, and rest themselves from 
the labors of their journey; for they 
had suffered many things; they had 
suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.
17 And  now,  it  came  to  pass  on 
the morrow that king Limhi sent a  
proclamation among all his people,  
that  thereby  they  might  gather 
themselves together to the a temple, 
to hear the words which he should 
speak unto them.

18 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  gathered  themselves  to-
gether that he a spake unto them in 
this wise, saying: O ye, my people, 
lift up your heads and be comforted; 
for behold, the time is at hand, or 
is not far distant, when we shall no 
longer be in subjection to our en-
emies, notwithstanding our many 
strugglings,  which  have  been  in 
vain;  yet  I  trust  there  b remaineth 
an effectual struggle to be made.

19 Therefore, lift up your heads, 
and rejoice, and put your a trust in 
b God, in that God who was the God 
of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; 
and also, that God who c brought the 
children of d Israel out of the land  
of  Egypt,  and  caused  that  they 
should walk through the e Red Sea 
on dry ground, and fed them with 
f manna that they might not perish 
in the wilderness; and many more 
things did he do for them.

20 And again, that same God has 
brought our fathers a out of the land 
of Jerusalem, and has kept and pre-
served his people even until now; 
and behold, it is b because of our in-
iquities and abominations that he  
has brought us into bondage.

21 And  ye  all  are  witnesses  this 
day, that Zeniff, who was made king 
over  this  people,  he  being  a over-
zealous  to  inherit  the  land  of  his 
fathers, therefore being deceived by 
the cunning and craftiness of king  
Laman, who having entered into a 
treaty with king Zeniff, and having  
yielded up into his hands the posses-
sions of a part of the land, or even 
the  city  of  Lehi-Nephi,  and  the  
city of Shilom; and the land round 
about—

22 And all this he did, for the sole 
purpose of a bringing this people into 
subjection or into bondage. And be-
hold, we at this time do pay b tribute  
to the king of the Lamanites, to the 
amount of one half of our corn, and 
our barley, and even all our grain 
of every kind, and one half of the 
increase of our flocks and our herds; 
and even one half of all we have or 
possess the king of the Lamanites 
doth exact of us, or our lives.

23 And now, is not this grievous 
to  be  borne?  And  is  not  this,  our 
affliction, great? Now behold, how 
great reason we have to a mourn.

24 Yea, I say unto you, great are the 
reasons which we have to a mourn; 
for behold how many of our breth-
ren have been slain, and their blood 
has been spilt in vain, and all be-
cause of iniquity.

25 For if this people had not fallen 
into transgression the Lord would 
not have suffered that this great evil 
should come upon them. But behold,

they  would  not  hearken  unto  his 
words; but there arose contentions 
among them, even so much that they 
did shed blood among themselves.
26 And a a prophet of the Lord have 
they b slain; yea, a chosen man of God,  
who told them of their wickedness 
and abominations, and prophesied 
of many things which are to come, 
yea, even the coming of Christ.

27 And because he said unto them 
that Christ was the a God, the Father 
of all things, and said that he should 
take upon him the b image of man, 
and  it  should  be  the  c image  after 
which man was created in the be-
ginning; or in other words, he said 
that man was created after the im-
age of  d God, and that God should 
come down among the children of 
men, and take upon him flesh and 
blood, and go forth upon the face 
of the earth—

28 And now, because he said this, 
they  did  a put  him  to  death;  and 
many  more  things  did  they  do 
which brought down the wrath of 
God  upon  them.  Therefore,  who 
wondereth that they are in bond-
age, and that they are smitten with 
sore afflictions?

29 For behold, the Lord hath said: 
I will not a succor my people in the 
day  of  their  transgression;  but  I 
will hedge up their ways that they 
prosper not; and their doings shall 
be  as  a  b stumbling  block  before  
them.

30 And again, he saith: If my people  
shall sow a filthiness they shall b reap 
the c chaff thereof in the whirlwind; 
and the effect thereof is poison.

31 And  again  he  saith:  If  my  

people  shall  sow  filthiness  they 
shall  reap  the  a east  wind,  which 
bringeth immediate destruction.

32 And now, behold, the promise 
of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are 
smitten and afflicted.

33 But if ye will a turn to the Lord 
with full purpose of heart, and put 
your  trust  in  him,  and  serve  him 
with all b diligence of mind, if ye do 
this, he will, according to his own 
will and pleasure, deliver you out 
of bondage.

CHAPTER 8
Ammon teaches the people of Limhi—
He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite 
plates—Ancient records can be trans-
lated by seers—No gift is greater than 
seership. About 121 b.c.
And it came to pass that after king 
Limhi had made an end of a speak-
ing to his people, for he spake many 
things unto them and only a few of 
them have I written in this book, he 
told his people all the things con-
cerning  their  brethren  who  were 
in the land of Zarahemla.

2 And  he  caused  that  Ammon 
should stand up before the multi-
tude,  and  rehearse  unto  them  all  
that had happened unto their breth-
ren from the time that a Zeniff went 
up out of the land even until the 
time that he b himself came up out 
of the land.

3 And he also rehearsed unto them 
the last words which king Benjamin 
had  a taught  them,  and  explained 
them to the people of king Limhi, 
so that they might understand all 
the words which he spake.

MOSIAH 8  : 4–16

4 And it came to pass that after he 
had done all this, that king Limhi 
dismissed the multitude, and caused 
that they should return every one 
unto his own house.

5 And it came to pass that he caused 
that the a plates which contained the 
b record of his people from the time 
that  they  left  the  c land  of  Zara-
hemla,  should  be  brought  before  
Ammon, that he might read them.
6 Now,  as  soon  as  Ammon  had 
read the record, the king inquired 
of him to know if he could a inter-
pret  languages,  and  Ammon  told 
him that he could not.

7 And  the  king  said  unto  him: 
Being grieved for the afflictions of 
my people, I caused that a forty and 
three of my people should take a 
journey  into  the  wilderness,  that 
thereby they might find the land 
of Zarahemla, that we might appeal 
unto our brethren to deliver us out 
of bondage.

8 And they were lost in the wilder-
ness for the space of  a many days, 
yet they were diligent, and found 
not the land of Zarahemla but re-
turned to this land, having traveled 
in a land among many waters, hav-
ing  discovered  a  land  which  was 
covered with b bones of men, and of 
beasts, and was also covered with 
ruins  of  buildings  of  every  kind, 
having  discovered  a  land  which 
had  been  peopled  with  a  people 
who were as numerous as the hosts  
of Israel.

9 And  for  a  testimony  that  the 
things that they had said are true 
they  have  brought  a twenty-four 
plates  which  are  filled  with  en-
gravings, and they are of pure gold.
10 And  behold,  also,  they  have 
brought  a breastplates,  which  are 

large,  and  they  are  of  b brass  and 
of copper, and are perfectly sound.
11 And again, they have brought 
swords, the hilts thereof have per-
ished, and the blades thereof were 
cankered with rust; and there is no 
one in the land that is able to inter-
pret the language or the engravings 
that are on the plates. Therefore I 
said unto thee: Canst thou translate?
12 And  I  say  unto  thee  again: 
Knowest thou of any one that can 
translate?  For  I  am  desirous  that 
these records should be translated 
into  our  language;  for,  perhaps, 
they will give us a knowledge of a 
remnant  of  the  people  who  have 
been destroyed, from whence these 
records came; or, perhaps, they will 
give  us  a  knowledge  of  this  very 
people  who  have  been  destroyed; 
and I am desirous to know the cause 
of their destruction.

13 Now Ammon said unto him: I 
can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a 
man that can a translate the records; 
for he has wherewith that he can 
look, and translate all records that 
are of ancient date; and it is a gift 
from God. And the things are called 
b interpreters, and no man can look 
in them except he be commanded, 
lest he should look for that he ought 
not and he should perish. And who-
soever  is  commanded  to  look  in 
them, the same is called c seer.

14 And behold, the king of the peo-
ple who are in the land of Zarahemla 
is the man that is commanded to 
do these things, and who has this 
high gift from God.

15 And the king said that a a seer 

is greater than a prophet.

16 And Ammon said that a seer is 
a revelator and a prophet also; and 
a gift which is greater can no man

have, except he should possess the 
power of God, which no man can; 
yet  a  man  may  have  great  power 
given him from God.

17 But a seer can know of things 
which are past, and also of things 
which are to come, and by them shall  
all  things  be  revealed,  or,  rather, 
shall secret things be made mani-
fest, and hidden things shall come 
to light, and things which are not 
known  shall  be  made  known  by 
them, and also things shall be made 
known  by  them  which  otherwise 
could not be known.

18 Thus God has provided a means 
that  man,  through  faith,  might 
work  mighty  miracles;  therefore 
he becometh a great benefit to his 
fellow beings.

19 And  now,  when  Ammon  had 
made an end of speaking these words 
the king rejoiced exceedingly, and  
gave thanks to God, saying: Doubt-
less a  a great mystery is contained 
within these plates, and these inter-
preters were doubtless prepared for 
the purpose of unfolding all such 
mysteries to the children of men.

20 O how marvelous are the works 
of the Lord, and how long doth he 
suffer  with  his  people;  yea,  and 
how  a blind  and  impenetrable  are 
the understandings of the children 
of men; for they will not seek wis-
dom,  neither  do  they  desire  that 
b she should rule over them!

21 Yea,  they  are  as  a  wild  flock 
which fleeth from the shepherd, and  
scattereth, and are driven, and are 
devoured by the beasts of the forest.

The Record of Zeniff—An account 
of his people, from the time they 
left the land of Zarahemla until the  
time that they were delivered out 
of the hands of the Lamanites.

Comprising chapters 9 through 22.

CHAPTER 9

Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to 
possess the land of Lehi-Nephi—The La-
manite king permits them to inherit the 
land—There is war between the Lamanites 
and Zeniff’s people. About 200–187 b.c.
a I,  b Zeniff, having been taught in 
all  the  language  of  the  Nephites, 
and having had a knowledge of the 
land of c Nephi, or of the land of our 
fathers’ first inheritance, and hav-
ing been sent as a spy among the 
Lamanites that I might spy out their 
forces, that our army might come 
upon them and destroy them—but 
when  I  saw  that  which  was  good 
among  them  I  was  desirous  that 
they should not be destroyed.

92 Therefore,  I  contended  with  my 
brethren in the wilderness, for I would 
that our ruler should make a treaty 
with them; but he being an austere 
and a blood-thirsty man commanded 
that I should be slain; but I was res-
cued by the shedding of much blood; 
for father fought against father, and 
brother  against  brother,  until  the 
greater number of our army was de-
stroyed in the wilderness; and we re-
turned, those of us that were spared, 
to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that 
tale to their wives and their children.
3 And  yet,  I  being  a over-zealous 
to inherit the land of our fathers, 
collected as many as were desirous 
to  go  up  to  possess  the  land,  and 
started again on our b journey into 
the wilderness to go up to the land; 
but we were smitten with famine 
and  sore  afflictions;  for  we  were 
slow to remember the Lord our God.
4 Nevertheless,  after  many  days’ 
wandering  in  the  wilderness  we 
pitched our tents in the place where 
our brethren were slain, which was 
near to the land of our fathers.

5 And it came to pass that I went 
again with four of my men into the

city, in unto the king, that I might 
know of the disposition of the king, 
and  that  I  might  know  if  I  might 
go in with my people and possess 
the land in peace.

6 And I went in unto the king, and 
he covenanted with me that I might 
possess the a land of Lehi-Nephi, and 
the land of Shilom.

7 And  he  also  commanded  that 
his people should depart out of the 
land, and I and my people went into 
the land that we might possess it.
8 And  we  began  to  build  build-
ings,  and  to  repair  the  walls  of 
the city, yea, even the walls of the 
city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of  
Shilom.

9 And we began to till the ground, 
yea, even with all manner of a seeds, 
with seeds of corn, and of wheat, 
and of barley, and with neas, and 
with sheum, and with seeds of all 
manner  of  fruits;  and  we  did  be-
gin to multiply and prosper in the  
land.

10 Now  it  was  the  cunning  and 
the  craftiness  of  king  a Laman,  to 
b bring  my  people  into  bondage, 
that  he  yielded  up  the  land  that 
we might possess it.

11 Therefore it came to pass, that 
after we had dwelt in the land for 
the space of twelve years that king 
Laman began to grow uneasy, lest 
by  any  means  my  people  should 
a wax strong in the land, and that 
they could not overpower them and 
bring them into bondage.

12 Now they were a a lazy and an 
b idolatrous people; therefore they 
were desirous to bring us into bond-
age, that they might glut themselves 
with the labors of our hands; yea, 
that  they  might  feast  themselves 
upon the flocks of our fields.

13 Therefore it came to pass that 
king  Laman  began  to  stir  up  his 

people  that  they  should  contend 
with my people; therefore there be-
gan to be wars and contentions in  
the land.

14 For,  in  the  thirteenth  year  of 
my  reign  in  the  land  of  Nephi,  
away  on  the  south  of  the  land  of  
a Shilom, when my people were wa-
tering  and  b feeding  their  flocks,  
and  tilling  their  lands,  a  numer-
ous host of Lamanites came upon 
them and began to slay them, and 
to take off their flocks, and the corn 
of their fields.

15 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that 
they  fled,  all  that  were  not  over-
taken, even into the city of Nephi, 
and did call upon me for protection.
16 And it came to pass that I did 
arm them with bows, and with ar-
rows, with swords, and with cime-
ters, and with clubs, and with slings, 
and  with  all  manner  of  weapons 
which we could invent, and I and 
my people did go forth against the 
Lamanites to battle.

17 Yea, in the a strength of the Lord 
did  we  go  forth  to  battle  against 
the  Lamanites;  for  I  and  my  peo-
ple  did  cry  mightily  to  the  Lord 
that he would b deliver us out of the 
hands of our enemies, for we were 
awakened to a remembrance of the 
deliverance of our fathers.

18 And  God  did  a hear  our  cries 
and did answer our prayers; and we  
did go forth in his might; yea, we did  
go forth against the Lamanites, and 
in one day and a night we did slay 
three thousand and forty-three; we 
did  slay  them  even  until  we  had 
driven them out of our land.

19 And I, myself, with mine own 
hands, did help to bury their dead. 
And  behold,  to  our  great  sorrow  
and lamentation, two hundred and 
seventy-nine of our brethren were 
slain.

CHAPTER 10

King Laman dies—His people are wild 
and ferocious and believe in false tra-
ditions—Zeniff and his people prevail 
against them. About 187–160 b.c.
And it came to pass that we again 
began to establish the kingdom and 
we again began to possess the land 
in peace. And I caused that there 
should  be  a weapons  of  war  made 
of every kind, that thereby I might 
have weapons for my people against 
the time the Lamanites should come 
up again to war against my people.
2 And  I  set  guards  round  about 
the land, that the Lamanites might 
not come upon us again unawares 
and destroy us; and thus I did guard 
my people and my flocks, and keep 
them  from  falling  into  the  hands 
of our enemies.

3 And it came to pass that we did 
inherit the land of our fathers for 
many  years,  yea,  for  the  space  of 
twenty and two years.

4 And  I  did  cause  that  the  men 
should till the ground, and raise all 
manner of  a grain and all manner 
of fruit of every kind.

5 And I did cause that the women 
should spin, and toil, and work, and 
work all manner of fine linen, yea, 
and  a cloth  of  every  kind,  that  we 
might  clothe  our  nakedness;  and 
thus we did prosper in the land—
thus we did have continual peace 
in the land for the space of twenty 
and two years.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
a Laman died, and his son began to 
reign  in  his  stead.  And  he  began 
to  stir  his  people  up  in  rebellion 
against my people; therefore they 
began  to  prepare  for  war,  and  to 
come up to battle against my people.
7 But I had sent my spies out round 
about the land of a Shemlon, that I 

might discover their preparations, 
that  I  might  guard  against  them, 
that they might not come upon my 
people and destroy them.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  up  upon  the  north  of  the 
land of Shilom, with their numer-
ous hosts, men a armed with b bows,  
and with arrows, and with swords,  
and  with  cimeters,  and  with  
stones, and with slings; and they had  
their heads shaved that they were 
naked; and they were girded with a  
leathern girdle about their loins.

9 And it came to pass that I caused 
that the women and children of my 
people should be hid in the wilder-
ness; and I also caused that all my 
old men that could bear arms, and 
also  all  my  young  men  that  were 
able  to  bear  arms,  should  gather 
themselves together to go to battle 
against  the  Lamanites;  and  I  did 
place  them  in  their  ranks,  every 
man according to his age.

10 And it came to pass that we did 
go up to battle against the Lamanites;  
and I, even I, in my old age, did go 
up to battle against the Lamanites. 
And it came to pass that we did go up  
in the a strength of the Lord to battle.
11 Now, the Lamanites knew noth-
ing  concerning  the  Lord,  nor  the 
strength of the Lord, therefore they 
depended upon their own strength. 
Yet  they  were  a  strong  people,  as 
to the a strength of men.

12 They  were  a  a wild,  and  fero-
cious, and a blood-thirsty people, 
believing in the b tradition of their 
fathers,  which  is  this—Believing 
that they were driven out of the land  
of Jerusalem because of the iniqui-
ties of their fathers, and that they 
were c wronged in the wilderness by 
their brethren, and they were also 
wronged while crossing the sea;

wronged while in the land of their 
a first  inheritance,  after  they  had 
crossed the sea, and all this because 
that  Nephi  was  more  faithful  in 
keeping the commandments of the 
Lord—therefore  b he  was  favored 
of the Lord, for the Lord heard his 
prayers  and  answered  them,  and 
he  took  the  lead  of  their  journey 
in the wilderness.

14 And his brethren were a wroth 
with him because they b understood 
not the dealings of the Lord; they 
were also wroth with him upon the 
waters because they hardened their 
hearts against the Lord.

15 And  again,  they  were  a wroth 
with  him  when  they  had  arrived 
in the promised land, because they 
said that he had taken the b ruling 
of  the  people  out  of  their  hands; 
and they sought to kill him.

16 And  again,  they  were  wroth 
with  him  because  he  departed 
into  the  wilderness  as  the  Lord 
had commanded him, and took the 
a records  which  were  engraven  on 
the  plates  of  brass,  for  they  said 
that he b robbed them.

17 And  thus  they  have  taught  
their children that they should hate 
them,  and  that  they  should  mur-
der them, and that they should rob  
and plunder them, and do all they 
could  to  destroy  them;  therefore 
they have an eternal hatred towards 
the children of Nephi.

18 For  this  very  cause  has  king 
Laman, by his a cunning, and lying 
craftiness,  and  his  fair  promises, 
deceived  me,  that  I  have  brought 
this  my  people  up  into  this  land, 
that  they  may  destroy  them;  yea, 
and we have suffered these many 
years in the land.

19 And now I, Zeniff, after having 
told all these things unto my people  

concerning  the  Lamanites,  I  did 
stimulate them to go to battle with 
their might, putting their trust in 
the Lord; therefore, we did contend 
with them, face to face.

20 And it came to pass that we did 
drive them again out of our land; 
and  we  slew  them  with  a  great 
slaughter,  even  so  many  that  we 
did not number them.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
returned  again  to  our  own  land, 
and  my  people  again  began  to 
a tend their flocks, and to till their  
ground.

22 And now I, being old, did confer 
the kingdom upon one of my sons; 
therefore, I say no more. And may 
the Lord a bless my people. Amen.

King  Noah  rules  in  wickedness—He 
revels in riotous living with his wives 
and  concubines—Abinadi  prophesies 
that the people will be taken into bond-
age—His life is sought by King Noah. 
About 160–150 b.c.

And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon 
Noah,  one  of  his  sons;  therefore 
Noah began to reign in his stead; 
and he did not walk in the ways of 
his father.

2 For behold, he did not keep the 
commandments of God, but he did 
walk  after  the  desires  of  his  own 
heart. And he had many wives and 
a concubines. And he did b cause his 
people to commit sin, and do that 
which was c abominable in the sight 
of the Lord. Yea, and they did com-
mit d whoredoms and e all manner of 
wickedness.

3 And he laid a  a tax of one fifth 
part of all they possessed, a fifth part  
of  their  gold  and  of  their  silver,

and a fifth part of their b ziff, and 
of their copper, and of their brass 
and their iron; and a fifth part of 
their fatlings; and also a fifth part 
of all their grain.

4 And all this did he take to a sup-
port himself, and his wives and his 
b concubines;  and  also  his  priests, 
and  their  wives  and  their  concu-
bines; thus he had changed the af-
fairs of the kingdom.

5 For he put down all the priests 
that  had  been  consecrated  by  his 
father, and consecrated new a ones 
in their stead, such as were lifted 
up in the pride of their hearts.

6 Yea,  and  thus  they  were  sup-
ported in their laziness, and in their 
idolatry, and in their whoredoms, 
by the taxes which king Noah had 
put upon his people; thus did the 
people  labor  exceedingly  to  sup-
port iniquity.

7 Yea, and they also became idola-
trous, because they were deceived 
by the vain and flattering words of 
the king and priests; for they did 
speak flattering things unto them.
8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Noah built many elegant and spa-
cious buildings; and he ornamented 
them with fine work of wood, and 
of all manner of a precious things, of 
gold, and of silver, and of iron, and 
of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;
9 And he also built him a spacious 
palace, and a throne in the midst 
thereof, all of which was of fine wood  
and was ornamented with gold and 
silver and with precious things.

10 And  he  also  caused  that  his 
workmen should work all manner 
of  fine  work  within  the  walls  of 
the  a temple,  of  fine  wood,  and  of 
copper, and of brass.

11 And the seats which were set 

apart for the  a high priests, which 
were above all the other seats, he 
did ornament with pure gold; and 
he caused a breastwork to be built 
before them, that they might rest 
their bodies and their arms upon 
while they should speak lying and 
vain words to his people.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
built a a tower near the temple; yea, 
a very high tower, even so high that 
he could stand upon the top thereof 
and overlook the land of b Shilom, 
and also the land of c Shemlon, which 
was  possessed  by  the  Lamanites; 
and he could even look over all the 
land round about.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
caused many buildings to be built 
in the land Shilom; and he caused a 
great tower to be built on the a hill 
north  of  the  land  Shilom,  which 
had been a resort for the children 
of Nephi at the time they b fled out 
of the land; and thus he did do with 
the riches which he obtained by the 
taxation of his people.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
placed  his  heart  upon  his  riches, 
and  he  spent  his  time  in  a riotous 
living with his wives and his con-
cubines; and so did also his priests 
spend their time with harlots.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
planted vineyards round about in 
the land; and he built wine-presses, 
and made a wine in abundance; and 
therefore he became a wine-bibber, 
and also his people.

manites began to come in upon his 
people, upon small numbers, and to 
slay them in their fields, and while 
they were tending their flocks.

off; but he did not send a sufficient 
number, and the Lamanites came 
upon  them  and  killed  them,  and 
drove many of their flocks out of 
the land; thus the Lamanites began 
to  destroy  them,  and  to  exercise 
their hatred upon them.

18 And it came to pass that king 
Noah sent his armies against them, 
and they were driven back, or they 
drove them back for a time; there-
fore,  they  returned  rejoicing  in 
their spoil.

19 And now, because of this great 
victory they were lifted up in the 
pride of their hearts; they did a boast 
in their own strength, saying that 
their fifty could stand against thou-
sands  of  the  Lamanites;  and  thus 
they  did  boast,  and  did  delight 
in blood, and the shedding of the 
blood  of  their  brethren,  and  this 
because of the wickedness of their 
king and priests.

20 And it came to pass that there 
was a man among them whose name 
was  a Abinadi;  and  he  went  forth 
among them, and began to proph-
esy, saying: Behold, thus saith the 
Lord, and thus hath he commanded 
me, saying, Go forth, and say unto 
this people, thus saith the Lord—
Wo be unto this people, for I have 
seen their abominations, and their 
wickedness, and their whoredoms; 
and except they repent I will b visit 
them in mine anger.

21 And  except  they  repent  and 
turn to the Lord their God, behold, 
I will deliver them into the hands 
of their enemies; yea, and they shall 
be brought into a bondage; and they 
shall  be  afflicted  by  the  hand  of 
their enemies.

22 And it shall come to pass that 

they shall a know that I am the Lord 
their God, and am a b jealous God, 
visiting the iniquities of my people.
23 And it shall come to pass that 
except this people repent and turn 
unto the Lord their God, they shall 
be brought into bondage; and none 
shall a deliver them, except it be the 
Lord the Almighty God.

24 Yea, and it shall come to pass 
that when they shall a cry unto me 
I will be  b slow to hear their cries; 
yea, and I will suffer them that they 
be smitten by their enemies.

25 And except they repent in a sack-
cloth and ashes, and cry mightily to 
the Lord their God, I will not b hear 
their prayers, neither will I deliver 
them  out  of  their  afflictions;  and 
thus saith the Lord, and thus hath 
he commanded me.

26 Now it came to pass that when 
Abinadi  had  spoken  these  words 
unto  them  they  were  wroth  with 
him, and sought to take away his 
life;  but  the  Lord  a delivered  him 
out of their hands.

27 Now when king Noah had heard 
of  the  words  which  Abinadi  had 
spoken unto the people, he was also 
wroth; and he said: a Who is Abin-
adi, that I and my people should be 
judged of him, or b who is the Lord, 
that  shall  bring  upon  my  people 
such great affliction?

28 I command you to bring Abinadi 
hither, that I may slay him, for he 
has said these things that he might 
a stir  up  my  people  to  anger  one 
with another, and to raise conten-
tions among my people; therefore 
I will slay him.

29 Now the eyes of the people were 
a blinded; therefore they b hardened 
their  hearts  against  the  words  of

Abinadi, and they sought from that 
time forward to take him. And king 
Noah  hardened  his  heart  against 
the  word  of  the  Lord,  and  he  did 
not repent of his evil doings.

CHAPTER 12
Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying 
the  destruction  of  the  people  and  the 
death of King Noah—The false priests 
quote the scriptures and pretend to keep 
the  law  of  Moses—Abinadi  begins  to 
teach  them  the  Ten  Commandments. 
About 148 b.c.
And it came to pass that after the 
space of two years that Abinadi came 
among them in disguise, that they 
knew him not, and began to a proph-
esy among them, saying: Thus has 
the Lord commanded me, saying— 
Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this 
my people, for they have hardened 
their hearts against my words; they 
have repented not of their evil do-
ings; therefore, I will b visit them in 
my anger, yea, in my fierce anger 
will I visit them in their iniquities 
and abominations.

2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! 
And the Lord said unto me: Stretch 
forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: 
Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to 
pass that this generation, because 
of their iniquities, shall be brought 
into  a bondage,  and  shall  be  smit-
ten on the b cheek; yea, and shall be 
driven by men, and shall be slain; 
and the vultures of the air, and the 
dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall  
devour their c flesh.

3 And it shall come to pass that the 
a life of king Noah shall be valued  
even as a garment in a hot b furnace; 
for he shall know that I am the Lord.

4 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
I  will  smite  this  my  people  with 
sore  afflictions,  yea,  with  famine 
and  with  a pestilence;  and  I  will 
cause that they shall b howl all the  
day long.

5 Yea, and I will cause that they 
shall  have  a burdens  lashed  upon 
their backs; and they shall be driven 
before like a dumb ass.

6 And it shall come to pass that I 
will send forth a hail among them, 
and it shall smite them; and they 
shall also be smitten with the b east 
wind; and c insects shall pester their 
land also, and devour their grain.

7 And they shall be smitten with a 
great pestilence—and all this will I 
do because of their a iniquities and 
abominations.

8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
except they repent I will utterly a de-
stroy them from off the face of the 
earth; yet they shall leave a b record 
behind  them,  and  I  will  preserve 
them for other nations which shall 
possess the land; yea, even this will 
I do that I may discover the abomi-
nations of this people to other na-
tions. And many things did Abinadi 
prophesy against this people.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were angry with him; and they took 
him and carried him bound before 
the  king,  and  said  unto  the  king: 
Behold, we have brought a man be-
fore thee who has prophesied evil 
concerning  thy  people,  and  saith 
that God will destroy them.

10 And  he  also  prophesieth  evil 
concerning thy a life, and saith that 
thy life shall be as a garment in a 
furnace of fire.

11 And again, he saith that thou 
shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk

of the field, which is run over by 
the beasts and trodden under foot.
12 And again, he saith thou shalt 
be  as  the  blossoms  of  a  thistle, 
which, when it is fully ripe, if the 
wind  bloweth,  it  is  driven  forth 
upon the face of the land. And he 
pretendeth  the  Lord  hath  spoken 
it. And he saith all this shall come 
upon thee except thou repent, and 
this because of thine iniquities.

13 And  now,  O  king,  what  great 
evil hast thou done, or what great 
sins  have  thy  people  committed, 
that we should be  a condemned of 
God or judged of this man?

14 And  now,  O  king,  behold,  we 
are a guiltless, and thou, O king, hast 
not sinned; therefore, this man has 
b lied  concerning  you,  and  he  has 
prophesied in vain.

15 And behold, we are strong, we 
shall not come into bondage, or be 
taken captive by our enemies; yea, 
and  thou  hast  prospered  in  the  
land, and thou shalt also prosper.
16 Behold, here is the man, we de-
liver him into thy hands; thou mayest  
do with him as seemeth thee good.
17 And it came to pass that king 
Noah caused that Abinadi should 
be  cast  into  prison;  and  he  com-
manded  that  the  a priests  should 
gather  themselves  together  that 
he might hold a council with them 
what he should do with him.

18 And it came to pass that they 
said unto the king: Bring him hither 
that we may question him; and the 
king commanded that he should be 
brought before them.

19 And  they  began  to  question 
him, that they might cross him, that 
thereby they might have wherewith 
to  a accuse  him;  but  he  answered 
them boldly, and withstood all their  
questions,  yea,  to  their  astonish-

ment; for he did  b withstand them 
in  all  their  questions,  and  did  
confound them in all their words.
20 And it came to pass that one of 
them said unto him: a What meaneth 
the words which are written, and 
which  have  been  taught  by  our 
fathers, saying:

21 a How beautiful upon the moun-
tains  are  the  feet  of  him  b that 
bringeth  good  tidings;  that  pub-
lisheth  peace;  that  bringeth  good 
tidings  of  good;  that  publisheth 
salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy 
God reigneth;

22 a Thy  watchmen  shall  lift  up 
the voice; with the voice together 
shall  they  sing;  for  they  shall  see 
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring 
again Zion;

23 Break  forth  into  joy;  sing  to-
gether ye waste places of Jerusalem; 
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;

24 The Lord hath made bare his 
holy a arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions, and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of our God?
25 And  now  Abinadi  said  unto 
them: Are you a priests, and pretend 
to teach this people, and to under-
stand the spirit of prophesying, and 
yet desire to know of me what these 
things mean?

26 I say unto you, wo be unto you 
for perverting the ways of the Lord! 
For if ye understand these things  
ye  have  not  taught  them;  there-
fore,  ye  have  perverted  the  ways 
of the Lord.

27 Ye have not applied your a hearts 
to  b understanding;  therefore,  ye 
have not been wise. Therefore, what 
teach ye this people?

28 And  they  said:  We  teach  the 

law of Moses.

172

If ye teach the a law of Moses why 
do ye not keep it? Why do ye set 
your hearts upon b riches? Why do 
ye commit whoredoms and c spend 
your  strength  with  harlots,  yea, 
and  cause  this  people  to  commit 
sin, that the Lord has cause to send 
me to prophesy against this people, 
yea, even a great evil against this  
people?

30 Know ye not that I speak the 
a truth? Yea, ye know that I speak 
the truth; and you ought to tremble 
before God.

31 And it shall come to pass that 
ye shall be smitten for your iniqui-
ties, for ye have said that ye teach 
the law of Moses. And what know 
ye  concerning  the  law  of  Moses? 
a Doth  salvation  come  by  the  law 
of Moses? What say ye?

32 And  they  answered  and  said 
that salvation did come by the law 
of Moses.

33 But  now  Abinadi  said  unto 
them: I know if ye a keep the com-
mandments  of  God  ye  shall  be 
saved; yea, if ye keep the command-
ments  which  the  Lord  delivered 
unto Moses in the mount of b Sinai,  
saying:

34 a I  am  the  Lord  thy  God,  who 
hath b brought thee out of the land of 
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
35 Thou shalt have no a other God 

before me.

36 a Thou shalt not make unto thee 
any graven image, or any likeness of 
any thing in heaven above, or things 
which are in the earth beneath.

37 Now Abinadi said unto them, 
Have  ye  done  all  this?  I  say  unto 
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye 
a taught this people that they should 
do all these things? I say unto you, 
Nay, ye have not.

CHAPTER 13

Abinadi is protected by divine power—
He teaches the Ten Commandments—
Salvation does not come by the law of 
Moses alone—God Himself will make 
an atonement and redeem His people. 
About 148 b.c.

And now when the king had heard 
these words, he said unto his priests: 
Away with this fellow, and slay him;  
for what have we to do with him, for  
he is a mad.

2 And  they  stood  forth  and  at-
tempted to lay their hands on him; 
but  he  withstood  them,  and  said  
unto them:

3 a Touch  me  not,  for  God  shall 
smite  you  if  ye  lay  your  hands 
upon me, for I have not delivered 
the  message  which  the  Lord  sent 
me to deliver; neither have I told 
you that which ye b requested that I 
should tell; therefore, God will not 
suffer that I shall be destroyed at  
this time.

4 But I must fulfil the command-
ments  wherewith  God  has  com-
manded me; and because I have told 
you the truth ye are angry with me. 
And again, because I have spoken 
the word of God ye have judged me 
that I am mad.

5 Now it came to pass after Abin-
adi had spoken these words that the 
people of king Noah durst not lay 
their hands on him, for the Spirit 
of the Lord was upon him; and his 
face a shone with exceeding luster, 
even  as  Moses’  did  while  in  the 
mount of Sinai, while speaking with  
the Lord.

6 And he spake with a power and 
authority from God; and he contin-
ued his words, saying:

MOSIAH 13  : 8–27

slay me, therefore I finish my a mes-
sage.  Yea,  and  I  perceive  that  it 
cuts you to your hearts because I 
tell you the truth concerning your  
iniquities.

8 Yea, and my words fill you with 
wonder and amazement, and with 
anger.

9 But  I  finish  my  message;  and 
then it  a matters not whither I go, 
if it so be that I am saved.

10 But this much I tell you, what 
you a do with me, after this, shall be 
as a b type and a shadow of things 
which are to come.

11 And now I read unto you the 
remainder of the a commandments 
of God, for I perceive that they are 
not written in your hearts; I perceive 
that ye have studied and taught b in-
iquity the most part of your lives.
12 And  now,  ye  remember  that 
I  a said  unto  you:  Thou  shalt  not 
make unto thee any graven image, 
or any likeness of things which are  
in heaven above, or which are in the  
earth  beneath,  or  which  are  in  
the water under the earth.

13 And again: Thou shalt not a bow 
down thyself unto them, nor serve 
them; for I the Lord thy God am a 
jealous God, visiting the iniquities 
of  the  fathers  upon  the  children, 
unto the third and fourth genera-
tions of them that hate me;

14 And showing mercy unto thou-
sands of them that love me and keep 
my commandments.

15 Thou shalt not take the name 
of the Lord thy God in vain; for the 
Lord  will  not  hold  him  a guiltless 
that taketh his name in vain.

16 Remember the a sabbath day, to 

keep it holy.

17 Six days shalt thou labor, and 

do all thy work;

18 But  the  seventh  day,  the  sab-
bath  of  the  Lord  thy  God,  thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy  
son,  nor  thy  daughter,  thy  man- 
servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor  
thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is 
within thy gates;

19 For in a six days the Lord made 
heaven and earth, and the sea, and 
all that in them is; wherefore the 
Lord blessed the sabbath day, and 
hallowed it.

20 a Honor  thy  b father  and  thy 
mother, that thy days may be long 
upon the land which the Lord thy 
God giveth thee.

21 Thou shalt not a kill.
22 Thou shalt not commit  a adul-

tery. Thou shalt not b steal.

23 Thou shalt not bear a false wit-

ness against thy neighbor.

24 Thou shalt not a covet thy neigh-
bor’s  house,  thou  shalt  not  covet 
thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man- 
servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his  
ox, nor his ass, nor anything that 
is thy neighbor’s.

25 And it came to pass that after 
Abinadi had made an end of these 
sayings that he said unto them: Have 
ye  a taught  this  people  that  they 
should observe to do all these things 
for to keep these commandments?
26 I  say  unto  you,  Nay;  for  if  ye 
had, the Lord would not have caused 
me to come forth and to prophesy 
evil concerning this people.

27 And now ye have said that sal-
vation cometh by the law of Moses. 
I say unto you that it is expedient 
that  ye  should  a keep  the  law  of 
Moses  as  yet;  but  I  say  unto  you,

that  the  time  shall  come  when  it 
shall b no more be expedient to keep 
the law of Moses.

28 And moreover, I say unto you, 
that  a salvation  doth  not  come  by 
the b law alone; and were it not for 
the c atonement, which God himself 
shall make for the sins and iniqui-
ties of his people, that they must 
unavoidably perish, notwithstand-
ing the law of Moses.

29 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
it was expedient that there should 
be  a  law  given  to  the  children  of 
Israel, yea, even a very a strict law; 
for they were a stiffnecked people, 
b quick to do iniquity, and slow to 
remember the Lord their God;

30 Therefore there was a a law given 
them, yea, a law of performances 
and of b ordinances, a law which they 
were to c observe strictly from day to 
day, to keep them in remembrance 
of God and their duty towards him.
31 But  behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
that all these things were a types of 
things to come.

32 And now, did they a understand 
the law? I say unto you, Nay, they 
did  not  all  understand  the  law; 
and  this  because  of  the  hardness 
of their hearts; for they understood 
not that there could not any man 
be  saved  b except  it  were  through 
the redemption of God.

33 For behold, did not Moses pro-
phesy  unto  them  concerning  the 
coming  of  the  Messiah,  and  that 
God should redeem his people? Yea, 
and even a all the prophets who have 
prophesied  ever  since  the  world  

began—have they not spoken more 
or less concerning these things?

34 Have  they  not  said  that  a God 
himself should come down among 
the children of men, and take upon 
him the form of man, and go forth 
in mighty power upon the face of 
the earth?

35 Yea, and have they not said also 
that  he  should  bring  to  pass  the 
a resurrection of the dead, and that 
he,  himself,  should  be  oppressed 
and afflicted?

CHAPTER 14

Isaiah  speaks  messianically—The 
Messiah’s  humiliation  and  sufferings 
are set forth—He makes His soul an 
offering for sin and makes intercession 
for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53. 
About 148 b.c.
Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who 
hath  a believed  our  report,  and  to 
whom  is  the  arm  of  the  Lord  re-
vealed?

2 For he shall grow up before him 
as a tender plant, and as a root out 
of  dry  ground;  he  hath  no  form 
nor comeliness; and when we shall 
see him there is no beauty that we 
should desire him.

3 He is a despised and rejected of  
men;  a  man  of  sorrows,  and  ac-
quainted with grief; and we hid as 
it were our faces from him; he was 
despised, and we esteemed him not.
4 Surely he has a borne our b griefs, 
and carried our sorrows; yet we did 
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, 
and afflicted.

MOSIAH 14  : 5–15  : 3

5 But  he  was  a wounded  for  our 
b transgressions, he was bruised for 
our iniquities; the chastisement of 
our peace was upon him; and with 
his stripes we are c healed.

6 All  we,  like  a sheep,  have  gone 
astray; we have turned every one 
to his own way; and the Lord hath 
laid on him the iniquities of us all.
7 He  was  oppressed,  and  he  was 
afflicted,  yet  he  a opened  not  his 
mouth; he is brought as a b lamb to 
the slaughter, and as a sheep before 
her shearers is dumb so he opened 
not his mouth.

8 He was taken from prison and 
from judgment; and who shall de-
clare  his  generation?  For  he  was 
cut off out of the land of the living; 
for the transgressions of my people 
was he stricken.

9 And he made his grave with the 
wicked,  and  with  the  a rich  in  his 
death; because he had done no b evil, 
neither was any deceit in his mouth.
10 Yet it pleased the Lord to a bruise 
him; he hath put him to grief; when 
thou shalt make his soul an offer-
ing  for  sin  he  shall  see  his  b seed, 
he shall prolong his days, and the 
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper 
in his hand.

11 He shall see the travail of his 
soul,  and  shall  be  satisfied;  by 
his knowledge shall my righteous  

servant justify many; for he shall 
a bear their iniquities.

12 Therefore will I divide him a 
portion with the a great, and b he shall 
divide the spoil with the strong; be-
cause he hath poured out his soul 
unto death; and he was numbered 
with the transgressors; and he bore 
the sins of many, and made c inter-
cession for the transgressors.

CHAPTER 15

How Christ is both the Father and the 
Son—He  will  make  intercession  and 
bear the transgressions of His people—
They and all the holy prophets are His 
seed—He brings to pass the Resurrec-
tion—Little children have eternal life. 
About 148 b.c.
And now Abinadi said unto them: 
I would that ye should understand 
that a God himself shall b come down 
among  the  children  of  men,  and 
shall c redeem his people.

2 And  because  he  a dwelleth  in 
b flesh he shall be called the c Son of 
God, and having subjected the flesh 
to the d will of the e Father, being the 
Father and the Son—

3 The  Father,  a because  he  was 
b conceived  by  the  power  of  God; 
and the Son, because of the flesh; 
thus  becoming  the  Father  and  
Son—

4 And they are a one God, yea, the 
very b Eternal c Father of heaven and 
of earth.

5 And  thus  the  flesh  becoming 
subject to the Spirit, or the Son to 
the Father, being one God, a suffer-
eth temptation, and yieldeth not to 
the temptation, but suffereth him-
self to be mocked, and  b scourged, 
and cast out, and disowned by his  
c people.

6 And after all this, after working 
many mighty miracles among the 
children  of  men,  he  shall  be  led, 
yea, even a as Isaiah said, as a sheep 
before the shearer is dumb, so he 
b opened not his mouth.

7 Yea, even so he shall be led, a cru-
cified, and slain, the b flesh becom-
ing  subject  even  unto  death,  the 
c will  of  the  Son  being  swallowed 
up in the will of the Father.

8 And  thus  God  breaketh  the 
a bands of death, having gained the 
b victory over death; giving the Son 
power to make c intercession for the 
children of men—

9 Having  ascended  into  heaven, 
having the bowels of mercy; being 
filled with compassion towards the 
children of men; standing betwixt 
them  and  justice;  having  broken 
the  bands  of  death,  taken  upon 
a himself  their  iniquity  and  their 
transgressions,  having  redeemed 
them, and b satisfied the demands of  
justice.

10 And now I say unto you, who 
shall  declare  his  a generation?  Be-
hold, I say unto you, that when his 
soul  has  been  made  an  offering 
for b sin he shall see his c seed. And 
now  what  say  ye?  And  who  shall 
be his seed?

11 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  that 
whosoever  has  heard  the  words 
of the  a prophets, yea, all the holy  
prophets who have prophesied con-
cerning the coming of the Lord—I 
say unto you, that all those who have 
hearkened unto their words, and be-
lieved that the Lord would redeem 
his people, and have looked forward 
to that day for a remission of their 
sins, I say unto you, that these are 
his  seed,  or  they  are  the  heirs  of  
the b kingdom of God.

12 For these are they whose sins 
a he  has  borne;  these  are  they  for 
whom he has died, to redeem them 
from their transgressions. And now, 
are they not his seed?

13 Yea,  and  are  not  the  a proph-
ets, every one that has opened his 
mouth  to  prophesy,  that  has  not 
fallen  into  transgression,  I  mean 
all the holy prophets ever since the 
world began? I say unto you that 
they are his seed.

14 And these are a they who have 
published peace, who have brought 
good  b tidings  of  good,  who  have 
c published salvation; and said unto 
Zion: Thy God reigneth!

MOSIAH 15  : 15–29

15 And O how beautiful upon the 

mountains were their feet!

16 And again, how beautiful upon 
the mountains are the feet of those 
that are still publishing peace!

17 And again, how beautiful upon 
the mountains are the feet of those 
who shall hereafter publish peace, 
yea, from this time henceforth and 
forever!

18 And  behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
this is not all. For O how beautiful 
upon the mountains are the  a feet 
of him that bringeth good tidings, 
that is the founder of b peace, yea, 
even the Lord, who has redeemed 
his people; yea, him who has granted 
salvation unto his people;

19 For were it not for the redemp-
tion  which  he  hath  made  for  his 
people, which was prepared from 
the a foundation of the world, I say 
unto  you,  were  it  not  for  this,  all 
mankind must have b perished.

20 But  behold,  the  bands  of 
death  shall  be  broken,  and  the 
Son reigneth, and hath power over 
the dead; therefore, he bringeth to 
pass the resurrection of the dead.
21 And there cometh a resurrec-
tion, even a a first resurrection; yea, 
even  a  resurrection  of  those  that 
have been, and who are, and who 
shall be, even until the resurrection 
of Christ—for so shall he be called.
22 And  now,  the  resurrection  of 
all the prophets, and all those that 
have believed in their words, or all 
those that have kept the command-
ments of God, shall come forth in 
the first resurrection; therefore, they 
are the first resurrection.

23 They are raised to a dwell with 

God who has redeemed them; thus 
they  have  eternal  life  through 
Christ, who has b broken the bands  
of death.

24 And these are those who have 
part in the first resurrection; and 
these are they that have died before 
Christ came, in their ignorance, not 
having  a salvation  declared  unto 
them. And thus the Lord bringeth 
about the restoration of these; and 
they have a part in the first resur-
rection, or have eternal life, being 
redeemed by the Lord.

25 And little  a children also have 

eternal life.

26 But  behold,  and  a fear,  and 
tremble  before  God,  for  ye  ought 
to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth 
none such that b rebel against him 
and c die in their sins; yea, even all 
those  that  have  perished  in  their 
sins  ever  since  the  world  began, 
that have wilfully rebelled against 
God, that have known the command-
ments of God, and would not keep 
them; d these are they that have e no 
part in the first f resurrection.

27 Therefore ought ye not to trem-
ble? For salvation cometh to none 
such; for the Lord hath redeemed 
none  such;  yea,  neither  can  the 
Lord  redeem  such;  for  he  cannot 
deny himself; for he cannot deny 
a justice when it has its claim.

28 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
the time shall come that the a salva-
tion of the Lord shall be declared to 
every nation, kindred, tongue, and  
people.

29 Yea,  Lord,  a thy  b watchmen 
shall  lift  up  their  voice;  with  the 
voice together shall they sing; for

they shall see eye to eye, when the 
Lord shall bring again Zion.

30 Break  forth  into  joy,  sing  to-
gether, ye waste places of Jerusalem; 
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

31 The Lord hath made bare his 
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the a salvation of our God.

CHAPTER 16

God redeems men from their lost and 
fallen  state—Those  who  are  carnal 
remain  as  though  there  were  no  re-
demption—Christ brings to pass a res-
urrection  to  endless  life  or  to  endless 
damnation. About 148 b.c.

And now, it came to pass that after 
Abinadi had spoken these words he 
stretched forth his hand and said: 
The time shall come when all shall 
see the a salvation of the Lord; when 
b every nation, kindred, tongue, and 
people shall see eye to eye and shall 
c confess before God that his d judg-
ments are just.

2 And then shall the  a wicked be 
b cast out, and they shall have cause 
to howl, and c weep, and wail, and 
gnash their teeth; and this because 
they would not d hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord 
redeemeth them not.

3 For they are a carnal and devilish, 
and the devil has power over them; 
yea, even that old serpent that did 

b beguile our first parents, which was  
the  c cause  of  their  fall;  which  
was the cause of d all mankind be-
coming  carnal,  sensual,  devilish, 
e knowing evil from good, f subject-
ing themselves to the devil.

4 Thus  all  mankind  were  a lost; 
and behold, they would have been 
endlessly lost were it not that God 
redeemed his people from their lost 
and fallen state.

5 But remember that he that per-
sists in his own a carnal nature, and 
goes on in the ways of sin and re-
bellion against God, remaineth in 
his fallen state and the b devil hath 
all  power  over  him.  Therefore  he 
is as though there was no c redemp-
tion made, being an enemy to God; 
and  also  is  the  d devil  an  enemy  
to God.

6 And now if Christ had not come 
into the world, speaking of things to 
come a as though they had already 
come,  there  could  have  been  no 
redemption.

7 And if Christ had not risen from 
the dead, or have broken the bands 
of death that the grave should have 
no victory, and that death should 
have  no  a sting,  there  could  have 
been no resurrection.

8 But there is a a resurrection, there-
fore the grave hath no victory, and 
the  sting  of  b death  is  swallowed  
up in Christ.

9 He is the a light and the life of the 
world; yea, a light that is endless,

MOSIAH 16  : 10–17  : 8

that  can  never  be  darkened;  yea, 
and  also  a  life  which  is  endless, 
that there can be no more death.

10 Even this mortal shall put on 
a immortality, and this b corruption 
shall put on incorruption, and shall 
be brought to c stand before the bar 
of God, to be judged of him accord-
ing to their works whether they be 
good or whether they be evil—

11 If  they  be  good,  to  the  resur-
rection  of  a endless  life  and  b hap-
piness; and if they be evil, to the 
resurrection of c endless damnation, 
being  delivered  up  to  the  devil, 
who  hath  subjected  them,  which 
is damnation—

12 Having gone according to their 
own carnal wills and desires; hav-
ing  never  called  upon  the  Lord 
while the arms of mercy were ex-
tended towards them; for the arms 
of  mercy  were  extended  towards 
them,  and  they  would  a not;  they 
being  warned  of  their  iniquities 
and yet they would not depart from 
them; and they were commanded 
to  repent  and  yet  they  would  
not repent.

13 And now, ought ye not to trem-
ble and repent of your sins, and re-
member that only in and through 
Christ ye can be saved?

14 Therefore, if ye teach the a law 
of  Moses,  also  teach  that  it  is  a 
b shadow of those things which are  
to come—

15 Teach  them  that  redemption 
cometh through Christ the Lord, who  
is the very a Eternal Father. Amen.

CHAPTER 17

Alma  believes  and  writes  the  words 
of Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death by 

fire—He prophesies disease and death by 
fire upon his murderers. About 148 b.c.

And now it came to pass that when 
Abinadi had finished these sayings, 
that the king commanded that the 
a priests should take him and cause 
that he should be put to b death.

2 But there was one among them 
whose name was a Alma, he also be-
ing a descendant of Nephi. And he 
was a young man, and he b believed 
the words which Abinadi had spo-
ken,  for  he  knew  concerning  the 
iniquity  which  Abinadi  had  tes-
tified  against  them;  therefore  he 
began to plead with the king that 
he would not be angry with Abin-
adi, but suffer that he might depart  
in peace.

3 But  the  king  was  more  wroth, 
and caused that Alma should be cast 
out from among them, and sent his 
servants after him that they might 
slay him.

4 But  he  fled  from  before  them 
and  a hid  himself  that  they  found 
him not. And he being concealed 
for  many  days  did  b write  all  the 
words which Abinadi had spoken.
5 And it came to pass that the king 
caused that his guards should sur-
round Abinadi and take him; and 
they bound him and cast him into 
prison.

6 And after three days, having coun-
seled  with  his  a priests,  he  caused 
that  he  should  again  be  brought 
before him.

7 And  he  said  unto  him:  Abin-
adi, we have found an accusation 
against thee, and thou art worthy  
of death.

himself should come down among

the children of men; and now, for 
this cause thou shalt be put to death 
unless thou wilt recall all the words 
which  thou  hast  spoken  evil  con-
cerning me and my people.

9 Now  Abinadi  said  unto  him:  I 
say unto you, I will a not recall the 
words  which  I  have  spoken  unto 
you concerning this people, for they 
are true; and that ye may know of 
their surety I have suffered myself 
that I have fallen into your hands.
10 Yea, and I will a suffer even un-
til death, and I will not recall my 
words, and they shall stand as a b tes-
timony against you. And if ye slay 
me  ye  will  shed  c innocent  blood, 
and this shall also stand as a testi-
mony against you at the last day.

11 And now king Noah was about 
to  release  him,  for  he  feared  his 
word; for he feared that the judg-
ments of God would come upon him.
12 But the a priests lifted up their 
voices  against  him,  and  began  to 
accuse him, saying: He has reviled 
the  king.  Therefore  the  king  was 
stirred  up  in  b anger  against  him, 
and  he  delivered  him  up  that  he 
might be slain.

13 And it came to pass that they 
took  him  and  bound  him,  and 
a scourged  his  skin  with  faggots, 
yea, even unto b death.

14 And now when the flames be-
gan  to  scorch  him,  he  cried  unto 
them, saying:

15 Behold, even as ye have done 
unto  me,  so  shall  it  come  to  pass 
that  thy  a seed  shall  cause  that 
many shall suffer the pains that I 
do suffer, even the pains of b death 
by fire; and this because they be-
lieve  in  the  salvation  of  the  Lord  
their God.

16 And it will come to pass that ye 
shall be afflicted with all manner of  
a diseases because of your iniquities.
17 Yea,  and  ye  shall  be  smitten 
on every hand, and shall be driven 
and scattered to and fro, even as a 
wild  flock  is  driven  by  wild  and 
ferocious beasts.

18 And  in  that  day  ye  shall  be 
a hunted, and ye shall be taken by 
the hand of your enemies, and then 
ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains 
of b death by fire.

19 Thus God executeth a vengeance 
upon those that destroy his people. 
O God, b receive my soul.

20 And now, when  a Abinadi had 
said  these  words,  he  fell,  having 
suffered death by fire; yea, having 
been put to death because he would 
not  deny  the  commandments  of 
God, having sealed the truth of his 
words by his b death.

CHAPTER 18
Alma preaches in private—He sets forth 
the covenant of baptism and baptizes 
at  the  waters  of  Mormon—He  orga-
nizes the Church of Christ and ordains 
priests—They support themselves and 
teach the people—Alma and his people 
flee from King Noah into the wilder-
ness. About 147–145 b.c.
And now, it came to pass that Alma, 
who had fled from the servants of 
king Noah, a repented of his sins and 
iniquities, and went about privately 
among  the  people,  and  began  to 
teach the words of Abinadi—

2 Yea, concerning that which was 
to  come,  and  also  concerning  the 
resurrection of the dead, and the a re-
demption of the people, which was 
to be brought to pass through the

power, and sufferings, and  b death 
of Christ, and his resurrection and 
ascension into heaven.

3 And as many as would hear his 
word he did teach. And he taught 
them  privately,  that  it  might  not 
come to the knowledge of the king. 
And many did believe his words.

4 And it came to pass that as many 
as did believe him did go forth to 
a a place which was called Mormon, 
having received its name from the 
king, being in the  b borders of the 
land having been infested, by times 
or at seasons, by wild beasts.

5 Now,  there  was  in  Mormon  a 
fountain of pure water, and Alma 
resorted thither, there being near 
the water a thicket of small trees, 
where he did hide himself in the 
daytime  from  the  searches  of  the 
king.

6 And it came to pass that as many 
as  believed  him  went  thither  to 
hear his words.

7 And it came to pass after many 
days there were a goodly number 
gathered  together  at  the  place  of 
Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. 
Yea, all were gathered together that 
believed on his word, to hear him. 
And  he  did  a teach  them,  and  did 
preach unto them repentance, and 
redemption, and faith on the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that he said 
unto them: Behold, here are the wa-
ters of Mormon (for thus were they 
called) and now, as ye are a desirous 
to come into the b fold of God, and 
to be called his people, and are will-
ing to bear one another’s burdens, 
that they may be light;

9 Yea, and are a willing to mourn 
with  those  that  b mourn;  yea,  and 

comfort those that stand in need of 
comfort, and to stand as c witnesses 
of God at all times and in all things, 
and in all places that ye may be in, 
even until death, that ye may be re-
deemed of God, and be numbered 
with those of the d first resurrection, 
that ye may have eternal life—

10 Now I say unto you, if this be 
the desire of your hearts, what have 
you against being a baptized in the 
b name of the Lord, as a witness be-
fore him that ye have entered into 
a c covenant with him, that ye will 
serve him and keep his command-
ments,  that  he  may  pour  out  his 
Spirit more abundantly upon you?
11 And now when the people had 
heard  these  words,  they  clapped 
their hands for joy, and exclaimed: 
This is the desire of our hearts.

12 And now it came to pass that 
Alma took Helam, he being one of 
the first, and went and stood forth 
in the water, and cried, saying: O 
Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy 
servant, that he may do this work 
with holiness of heart.

13 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, the a Spirit of the Lord was 
upon  him,  and  he  said:  Helam,  I 
baptize  thee,  having  b authority 
from  the  Almighty  God,  as  a  tes-
timony  that  ye  have  entered  into 
a c covenant to serve him until you 
are dead as to the mortal body; and 
may the Spirit of the Lord be poured 
out  upon  you;  and  may  he  grant 
unto you eternal life, through the 
redemption of Christ, whom he has 
prepared from the  d foundation of  
the world.

14 And after Alma had said these 
words, both Alma and Helam were

a buried in the water; and they arose 
and came forth out of the water re-
joicing, being filled with the Spirit.
15 And again, Alma took another, 
and went forth a second time into 
the  water,  and  baptized  him  ac-
cording to the first, only he did not 
bury a himself again in the water.

16 And after this manner he did 
baptize every one that went forth 
to the place of Mormon; and they 
were in number about two hundred 
and four souls; yea, and they were 
a baptized in the waters of Mormon, 
and  were  filled  with  the  b grace  
of God.

17 And they were called the church 
of  God,  or  the  a church  of  Christ, 
from that time forward. And it came 
to pass that whosoever was baptized 
by the power and authority of God 
was added to his church.

18 And it came to pass that Alma, 
having  a authority  from  God,  b or-
dained priests; even one priest to 
every fifty of their number did he 
ordain to preach unto them, and to 
c teach them concerning the things 
pertaining to the kingdom of God.
19 And he commanded them that 
a they  should  b teach  nothing  save 
it  were  the  things  which  he  had 
taught, and which had been spoken 
by the mouth of the holy prophets.
20 Yea, even he commanded them 
that  they  should  a preach  nothing 
save it were repentance and faith 
on  the  Lord,  who  had  redeemed 
his people.

21 And he commanded them that 

there should be no a contention one 
with another, but that they should 
look forward with b one eye, having 
one faith and one baptism, having 
their hearts c knit together in unity 
and in love one towards another.

22 And thus he commanded them 
to  preach.  And  thus  they  became 
the a children of God.

23 And he commanded them that 
they  should  observe  the  a sabbath 
day, and keep it holy, and also ev-
ery day they should give thanks to 
the Lord their God.

24 And he also commanded them 
that  the  priests  whom  he  had  or-
dained  a should  b labor  with  their 
own hands for their support.

25 And there was a one day in every 
week that was set apart that they 
should b gather themselves together 
to teach the people, and to worship 
the Lord their God, and also, as of-
ten as it was in their power, to c as-
semble themselves together.

26 And the priests were not to de-
pend upon the people for their sup-
port; but for their labor they were 
to  receive  the  a grace  of  God,  that 
they might wax strong in the Spirit, 
having the b knowledge of God, that 
they might teach with power and 
authority from God.

27 And  again  Alma  commanded 
that the people of the church should 
impart  of  their  substance,  a every 
one  according  to  that  which  he 
had;  if  he  have  more  abundantly 
he should impart more abundantly;

little  should  be  required;  and  to 
him that had not should be given.
28 And  thus  they  should  impart 
of  their  a substance  of  their  own 
free will and good desires towards 
God, and to those priests that stood 
in  need,  yea,  and  to  every  needy, 
naked soul.

29 And  this  he  said  unto  them, 
having  been  commanded  of  God; 
and they did a walk uprightly before 
God, imparting to one another both 
temporally and spiritually accord-
ing to their needs and their wants.
30 And now it came to pass that all 
this was done in Mormon, yea, by  
the a waters of Mormon, in the forest 
that was near the waters of Mor mon; 
yea, the place of Mormon, the waters  
of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, 
how beautiful are they to the eyes 
of  them  who  there  came  to  the 
knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, 
and how blessed are they, for they 
shall b sing to his praise forever.

31 And these things were done in 
the a borders of the land, that they 
might not come to the knowledge 
of the king.

32 But behold, it came to pass that 
the king, having discovered a move-
ment  among  the  people,  sent  his 
servants to watch them. Therefore 
on the day that they were assem-
bling themselves together to hear 
the word of the Lord they were dis-
covered unto the king.

33 And  now  the  king  said  that 
Alma  was  stirring  up  the  people 
to rebellion against him; therefore 
he sent his a army to destroy them.
34 And it came to pass that Alma 
and the people of the Lord were a ap-
prised of the coming of the king’s 
army; therefore they took their tents 
and  their  families  and  b departed 
into the wilderness.

35 And they were in number about 

a four hundred and fifty souls.

CHAPTER 19

Gideon seeks to slay King Noah—The 
Lamanites invade the land—King Noah 
suffers death by fire—Limhi rules as a 
tributary monarch. About 145–121 b.c.
And it came to pass that the a army of 
the king returned, having searched 
in vain for the people of the Lord.
2 And now behold, the forces of 
the king were small, having been 
reduced, and there began to be a 
division  among  the  remainder  of 
the people.

3 And  the  lesser  part  began  to 
a breathe  out  threatenings  against 
the king, and there began to be a 
great contention among them.

4 And now there was a man among 
them whose name was Gideon, and 
he being a strong man and an en-
emy to the king, therefore he drew 
his sword, and swore in his wrath 
that he would slay the king.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
fought with the king; and when the 
king saw that he was about to over-
power him, he fled and ran and got 
upon the a tower which was near the  
temple.

6 And Gideon pursued after him 
and was about to get upon the tower 
to slay the king, and the king cast 
his eyes round about towards the 
land of a Shemlon, and behold, the 
army of the Lamanites were within 
the borders of the land.

7 And now the king cried out in the 
anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon, 
a spare  me,  for  the  Lamanites  are 
upon us, and they will destroy us; 
yea, they will destroy my people.

8 And  now  the  king  was  not  so

he was about his a own life; never-
theless, Gideon did spare his life.

9 And  the  king  commanded  the 
people  that  they  should  flee  be-
fore the Lamanites, and he himself 
did go before them, and they did 
flee into the wilderness, with their 
women and their children.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  did  pursue  them,  and 
did  overtake  them,  and  began  to 
slay them.

11 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king commanded them that all the 
men should a leave their wives and 
their children, and flee before the 
Lamanites.

12 Now  there  were  many  that 
would  not  leave  them,  but  had 
rather stay and perish with them. 
And  the  rest  left  their  wives  and 
their children and fled.

13 And it came to pass that those 
who tarried with their wives and 
their children caused that their fair 
daughters should stand forth and 
plead with the Lamanites that they 
would not slay them.

14 And it came to pass that the La-
manites had compassion on them, 
for  they  were  charmed  with  the 
beauty of their women.

15 Therefore  the  Lamanites  did 
spare  their  lives,  and  took  them 
captives  and  carried  them  back 
to the land of Nephi, and granted 
unto them that they might possess 
the land, under the conditions that 
they would deliver up king Noah 
into the hands of the Lamanites, and 
deliver up their property, even a one 
half of all they possessed, one half 
of their gold, and their silver, and 
all their precious things, and thus 
they should pay tribute to the king 
of the Lamanites from year to year.
16 And now there was one of the 
sons of the king among those that 
were  taken  captive,  whose  name 
was a Limhi.

17 And  now  Limhi  was  desirous 
that  his  father  should  not  be  de-
stroyed;  nevertheless,  Limhi  was 
not ignorant of the iniquities of his 
father, he himself being a just man.
18 And it came to pass that Gideon 
sent  men  into  the  wilderness  se-
cretly,  to  search  for  the  king  and 
those  that  were  with  him.  And  it 
came to pass that they met the peo-
ple in the wilderness, all save the 
king and his priests.

19 Now  they  had  sworn  in  their 
hearts that they would return to the 
land of Nephi, and if their a wives 
and their children were slain, and 
also  those  that  had  tarried  with 
them, that they would seek revenge, 
and also perish with them.

20 And the king commanded them 
that  they  should  not  return;  and 
they were angry with the king, and 
caused that he should suffer, even 
unto a death by fire.

21 And  they  were  about  to  take 
the  priests  also  and  a put  them  to 
death, and they fled before them.
22 And it came to pass that they 
were  about  to  return  to  the  land 
of  Nephi,  and  they  met  the  men 
of Gideon. And the men of Gideon 
told them of all that had happened 
to their wives and their children; 
and that the Lamanites had granted 
unto them that they might possess 
the land by paying a tribute to the 
Lamanites  of  one  half  of  all  they 
possessed.

23 And  the  people  told  the  men 
of a Gideon that they had slain the 
king, and his b priests had fled from 
them farther into the wilderness.

24 And it came to pass that after 
they had ended the ceremony, that 
they returned to the land of Nephi, 
rejoicing, because their wives and 
their children were not slain; and 
they  told  Gideon  what  they  had 
done to the king.

25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the

king  of  the  Lamanites  made  an 
a oath  unto  them,  that  his  people 
should not slay them.

26 And also Limhi, being the son 
of  the  king,  having  the  kingdom 
conferred upon him a by the people, 
made b oath unto the king of the La-
manites that his people should pay 
c tribute unto him, even one half of 
all they possessed.

27 And it came to pass that Limhi 
began to establish the kingdom and  
to establish a peace among his people.
28 And the king of the Lamanites 
set  a guards round about the land, 
that he might b keep the people of 
Limhi in the land, that they might 
not depart into the wilderness; and 
he did support his guards out of the 
tribute which he did receive from 
the Nephites.

29 And now king Limhi did have 
continual  peace  in  his  kingdom 
for the space of two years, that the 
Lamanites did not molest them nor 
seek to destroy them.

CHAPTER 20
Some Lamanite daughters are abducted 
by the priests of Noah—The Lamanites 
wage war upon Limhi and his people—
The Lamanite hosts are repulsed and 
pacified. About 145–123 b.c.
Now there was a place in a Shemlon 
where the daughters of the Laman-
ites did gather themselves together 
to sing, and to b dance, and to make 
themselves merry.

2 And it came to pass that there 
was  one  day  a  small  number  of 
them gathered together to sing and 
to dance.

3 And now the priests of king Noah, 
being ashamed to return to the city 
of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that 
the people would a slay them, there-
fore they durst not return to their 
wives and their b children.

4 And having tarried in the wil-
derness, and having discovered the 
daughters  of  the  Lamanites,  they 
laid and watched them;

5 And when there were but few of 
them  gathered  together  to  dance, 
they came forth out of their secret 
places and took them and carried 
them  into  the  wilderness;  yea, 
twenty and four of the a daughters 
of the Lamanites they carried into 
the wilderness.

6 And it came to pass that when the 
Lamanites found that their daugh-
ters  had  been  missing,  they  were 
angry  with  the  people  of  Limhi, 
for they thought it was the people 
of Limhi.

7 Therefore they sent their armies 
forth;  yea,  even  the  king  himself 
went  before  his  people;  and  they 
went  up  to  the  land  of  Nephi  to 
destroy the people of Limhi.

8 And  now  Limhi  had  discov-
ered  them  from  the  a tower,  even 
all their preparations for war did 
he discover; therefore he gathered 
his people together, and laid wait 
for  them  in  the  fields  and  in  the  
forests.

9 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites had come up, that the 
people of Limhi began to fall upon 
them from their waiting places, and 
began to slay them.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
battle became exceedingly sore, for 
they fought like lions for their prey.
11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of Limhi began to drive the 
Lamanites  before  them;  yet  they 
were not half so numerous as the 
Lamanites.  But  they  a fought  for 
their  lives,  and  for  their  b wives, 
and  for  their  children;  therefore 
they  exerted  themselves  and  like 
dragons did they fight.

12 And it came to pass that they

among  the  number  of  their  dead; 
yet  he  was  not  dead,  having  been 
wounded and left upon the ground, 
so speedy was the flight of his people.
13 And they took him and bound 
up his wounds, and brought him be-
fore Limhi, and said: Behold, here 
is  the  king  of  the  Lamanites;  he 
having received a wound has fallen 
among their dead, and they have left 
him; and behold, we have brought 
him  before  you;  and  now  let  us  
slay him.

14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye 
shall not slay him, but bring him 
hither that I may see him. And they 
brought him. And Limhi said unto 
him: What cause have ye to come 
up to war against my people? Be-
hold, my people have not broken the 
a oath that I made unto you; there-
fore, why should ye break the oath 
which ye made unto my people?

15 And now the king said: I have 
broken the oath because thy peo-
ple did carry away the daughters of 
my people; therefore, in my anger 
I did cause my people to come up 
to war against thy people.

16 And now Limhi had heard noth-
ing concerning this matter; there-
fore  he  said:  I  will  search  among 
my people and whosoever has done 
this thing shall perish. Therefore he 
caused a search to be made among 
his people.

17 Now when a Gideon had heard 
these  things,  he  being  the  king’s 
captain,  he  went  forth  and  said 
unto the king: I pray thee forbear, 
and do not search this people, and 
lay not this thing to their charge.

18 For  do  ye  not  remember  the 
priests  of  thy  father,  whom  this 
people sought to destroy ? And are 
they not in the wilderness? And are 
not they the ones who have stolen 
the daughters of the Lamanites?

19 And now, behold, and tell the 
king of these things, that he may 

tell  his  people  that  they  may  be 
pacified  towards  us;  for  behold 
they are already preparing to come 
against  us;  and  behold  also  there 
are but few of us.

20 And  behold,  they  come  with 
their numerous hosts; and except 
the king doth pacify them towards 
us we must perish.

21 For are not the words of Abin-
adi a fulfilled, which he prophesied 
against us—and all this because we 
would not hearken unto the words 
of the Lord, and turn from our in-
iquities?

22 And now let us pacify the king, 
and  we  fulfil  the  a oath  which  we 
have made unto him; for it is bet-
ter that we should be in bondage 
than that we should lose our b lives; 
therefore, let us put a stop to the 
shedding of so much blood.

23 And now Limhi told the king 
all the things concerning his father, 
and the a priests that had fled into 
the wilderness, and attributed the 
carrying  away  of  their  daughters 
to them.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king was pacified towards his peo-
ple; and he said unto them: Let us 
go forth to meet my people, without 
arms; and I swear unto you with an 
a oath that my people shall not slay 
thy people.

25 And it came to pass that they 
followed the king, and went forth 
without arms to meet the Laman-
ites. And it came to pass that they 
did  meet  the  Lamanites;  and  the 
king  of  the  Lamanites  did  bow 
himself down before them, and did 
plead  in  behalf  of  the  people  of  
Limhi.

26 And when the Lamanites saw 
the people of Limhi, that they were 
without arms, they had a compassion 
on them and were pacified towards 
them, and returned with their king 
in peace to their own land.

CHAPTER 21

Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated 
by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet 
Ammon and are converted—They tell 
Ammon  of  the  twenty- four  Jaredite 
plates. About 122–121 b.c.

And it came to pass that Limhi and 
his people returned to the city of 
Nephi, and began to dwell in the 
land again in peace.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
many  days  the  Lamanites  began 
again  to  be  stirred  up  in  anger 
against the Nephites, and they be-
gan to come into the borders of the 
land round about.

3 Now they durst not slay them, 
because  of  the  a oath  which  their 
king had made unto Limhi; but they 
would smite them on their b cheeks, 
and exercise authority over them; 
and began to put heavy  c burdens 
upon their backs, and drive them 
as they would a dumb ass—

4 Yea, all this was done that the 
a word  of  the  Lord  might  be  b ful-
filled.

5 And now the afflictions of the 
Nephites were great, and there was 
no way that they could deliver them-
selves  out  of  their  hands,  for  the 
Lamanites had  a surrounded them 
on every side.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people began to murmur with the 
king  because  of  their  afflictions; 
and  they  began  to  be  desirous  to 
go against them to battle. And they 
did afflict the king sorely with their 
complaints;  therefore  he  granted 
unto them that they should do ac-
cording to their desires.

7 And  they  gathered  themselves 
together  again,  and  put  on  their 
armor, and went forth against the 

Lamanites to drive them out of their  
land.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did beat them, and drove 
them back, and a slew many of them.
9 And  now  there  was  a  great 
a mourning and lamentation among 
the  people  of  Limhi,  the  widow 
mourning  for  her  husband,  the 
son  and  the  daughter  mourning 
for  their  father,  and  the  brothers 
for their brethren.

10 Now there were a great many 
a widows in the land, and they did 
cry mightily from day to day, for 
a great fear of the Lamanites had 
come upon them.

11 And it came to pass that their 
continual cries did stir up the re-
mainder of the people of Limhi to 
anger  against  the  Lamanites;  and 
they went again to battle, but they 
were driven back again, suffering 
much loss.

12 Yea, they went again even the 
third time, and suffered in the like 
manner;  and  those  that  were  not 
slain returned again to the city of 
Nephi.

13 And  they  did  humble  them-
selves even to the dust, subjecting 
themselves to the a yoke of bondage, 
b submitting themselves to be smit-
ten, and to be driven to and fro, and 
burdened, according to the desires 
of their enemies.

14 And  they  did  a humble  them-
selves  even  in  the  depths  of  hu-
mility; and they did cry mightily 
to God; yea, even all the day long 
did  they  cry  unto  their  God  that 
he would b deliver them out of their  
afflictions.

15 And  now  the  Lord  was  a slow 
to hear their cry because of their 
iniquities;  nevertheless  the  Lord

did hear their b cries, and began to 
soften the hearts of the Lamanites 
that they began to ease their bur-
dens; yet the Lord did not see fit to 
deliver them out of bondage.

16 And it came to pass that they 
began to prosper by degrees in the 
land, and began to raise grain more 
abundantly, and flocks, and herds, 
that they did not suffer with hunger.
17 Now there was a great number 
of women, more than there was of 
men;  therefore  king  Limhi  com-
manded that every man should a im-
part to the support of the b widows 
and their children, that they might 
not  perish  with  hunger;  and  this 
they did because of the greatness of 
their number that had been slain.
18 Now the people of Limhi kept 
together in a body as much as it was 
possible,  and  secured  their  grain 
and their flocks;

19 And the king himself did not 
trust his person without the walls 
of the city, unless he took his guards 
with him, fearing that he might by 
some means fall into the hands of 
the Lamanites.

20 And he caused that his people 
should watch the land round about, 
that by some means they might take 
those priests that fled into the wil-
derness, who had stolen the a daugh-
ters of the Lamanites, and that had 
caused such a great destruction to 
come upon them.

21 For they were desirous to take 
them that they might a punish them; 
for  they  had  come  into  the  land 
of Nephi by night, and carried off 
their grain and many of their pre-
cious  things;  therefore  they  laid 
wait for them.

22 And it came to pass that there 
was no more disturbance between 
the  Lamanites  and  the  people  of 

Limhi,  even  until  the  time  that 
a Ammon  and  his  brethren  came 
into the land.

23 And  the  king  having  been 
without the gates of the city with 
his guard, a discovered Ammon and 
his brethren; and supposing them 
to be priests of Noah therefore he 
caused that they should be taken, 
and bound, and cast into  b prison. 
And had they been the priests of 
Noah  he  would  have  caused  that 
they should be put to death.

24 But when he found that they 
were  not,  but  that  they  were  his 
brethren, and had come from the 
a land of Zarahemla, he was filled 
with exceedingly great joy.

25 Now king Limhi had sent, pre-
vious to the coming of Ammon, a 
a small  number  of  men  to  b search 
for the land of Zarahemla; but they 
could not find it, and they were lost 
in the wilderness.

26 Nevertheless,  they  did  find  a 
land which had been peopled; yea, 
a land which was covered with dry 
a bones; yea, a land which had been 
peopled  and  which  had  been  de-
stroyed; and they, having supposed 
it to be the land of Zarahemla, re-
turned to the land of Nephi, having 
arrived in the borders of the land 
not many days before the b coming 
of Ammon.

27 And they brought a a record with 
them, even a record of the people 
whose bones they had found; and 
it was engraven on plates of ore.

28 And now Limhi was again filled 
with joy on learning from the mouth 
of Ammon that king Mosiah had a 
a gift from God, whereby he could 
b interpret such engravings; yea, and 
Ammon also did rejoice.

29 Yet Ammon and his brethren 
were filled with sorrow because so

many of their brethren had been 
a slain;

30 And  also  that  king  Noah  and 
his priests had caused the people 
to commit so many sins and iniqui-
ties against God; and they also did 
mourn  for  the  a death  of  Abinadi; 
and also for the b departure of Alma 
and the people that went with him, 
who had formed a church of God 
through the strength and power of 
God, and faith on the words which 
had been spoken by Abinadi.

31 Yea, they did mourn for their de-
parture, for they knew not whither 
they had fled. Now they would have 
gladly joined with them, for they 
themselves had entered into a a cov-
enant with God to serve him and 
keep his commandments.

32 And now since the coming of 
Ammon,  king  Limhi  had  also  en-
tered into a covenant with God, and 
also  many  of  his  people,  to  serve 
him and keep his commandments.
33 And it came to pass that king 
Limhi and many of his people were 
desirous to be baptized; but there 
was none in the land that had a au-
thority from God. And Ammon de-
clined doing this thing, considering 
himself an unworthy servant.

34 Therefore they did not at that 
time form themselves into a a church, 
waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. 
Now they were desirous to become 
even as Alma and his brethren, who 
had fled into the wilderness.

35 They were desirous to be bap-
tized as a witness and a testimony 
that they were willing to serve God 
with all their hearts; nevertheless 
they did prolong the time; and an 
account of their baptism shall be 
a given hereafter.

36 And now all the study of Am-
mon  and  a his  people,  and  king 
Limhi  and  his  people,  was  to  de-
liver themselves out of the hands of 
the Lamanites and from b bondage.

CHAPTER 22

Plans  are  made  for  the  people  to  es-
cape  from  Lamanite  bondage—The 
Lamanites are made drunk—The peo-
ple escape, return to Zarahemla, and 
become subject to King Mosiah. About 
121–120 b.c.

And now it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  king  Limhi  began  to 
consult with the people how they 
should  a deliver  themselves  out  of 
bondage; and even they did cause 
that  all  the  people  should  gather 
themselves together; and this they 
did that they might have the voice 
of the people concerning the matter.
2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
could find no way to deliver them-
selves out of bondage, except it were 
to take their women and children, 
and  their  flocks,  and  their  herds, 
and their tents, and depart into the 
wilderness; for the Lamanites being 
so numerous, it was impossible for 
the people of Limhi to contend with 
them, thinking to deliver themselves 
out of bondage by the sword.

3 Now it came to pass that a Gideon 
went  forth  and  stood  before  the 
king,  and  said  unto  him:  Now  O 
king, thou hast hitherto hearkened 
unto my words many times when 
we have been contending with our 
brethren, the Lamanites.

4 And  now  O  king,  if  thou  hast 
not found me to be an unprofitable 
servant, or if thou hast hitherto lis-
tened to my words in any degree, 
and  they  have  been  of  service  to 
thee,  even  so  I  desire  that  thou 
wouldst listen to my words at this 
time, and I will be thy servant and 
deliver this people out of bondage.
5 And the king granted unto him 
that he might speak. And Gideon 
said unto him:

6 Behold  the  back  pass,  through

that they gather together their flocks

received their b records, and also the 
c records which had been found by 
the people of Limhi.

15 And now it came to pass when 
the Lamanites had found that the 
people of Limhi had departed out 
of the land by night, that they sent 
an  a army  into  the  wilderness  to 
pursue them;

16 And  after  they  had  pursued 
them two days, they could no lon-
ger  follow  their  tracks;  therefore 
they were lost in the wilderness.

8 Thus  we  will  depart  with  our 
women and our children, our flocks, 
and our herds into the wilderness; 
and we will travel around the land 
of a Shilom.

9 And it came to pass that the king  
hearkened unto the words of Gideon.
10 And king Limhi caused that his 
people  should gather  their  flocks 
together; and he sent the tribute of 
wine to the Lamanites; and he also 
sent more wine, as a present unto 
them;  and  they  did  drink  freely 
of the wine which king Limhi did 
send unto them.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people  of  king  Limhi  did  a depart 
by night into the wilderness with 
their  flocks  and  their  herds,  and 
they  went  round  about  the  land 
of  b Shilom in the wilderness, and 
bent their course towards the land 
of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon 
and his brethren.

12 And  they  had  taken  all  their 
gold, and silver, and their precious 
things, which they could carry, and 
also their provisions with them, into 
the wilderness; and they pursued 
their journey.

13 And after being many days in the 
wilderness they a arrived in the land  
of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah’s 
people, and became his subjects.

14 And it came to pass that Mosiah 
a received them with joy; and he also

Comprising chapters 23 and 24.

CHAPTER 23
Alma refuses to be king—He serves as 
high  priest—The  Lord  chastens  His 
people, and the Lamanites conquer the 
land of Helam—Amulon, leader of King 
Noah’s wicked priests, rules subject to the 
Lamanite monarch. About 145–121 b.c.
Now  Alma,  having  been  a warned 
of the Lord that the armies of king 
Noah would come upon them, and 
having made it known to his people, 
therefore  they  gathered  together 
their flocks, and took of their grain, 
and b departed into the wilderness 
before the armies of king Noah.

2 And  the  Lord  did  strengthen 
them, that the people of king Noah 
could not overtake them to destroy 
them.

3 And they fled a eight days’ jour-

ney into the wilderness.

4 And  they  came  to  a  land,  yea, 
even a very beautiful and pleasant 
land, a land of pure water.

5 And  they  pitched  their  tents, 
and began to till the ground, and

began to build buildings; yea, they 
were  a industrious,  and  did  labor 
exceedingly.

6 And  the  people  were  desirous 
that  Alma  should  be  their  a king, 
for he was beloved by his people.

7 But he said unto them: Behold, 
it is not expedient that we should 
have a king; for thus saith the Lord: 
Ye shall a not esteem one flesh above 
another, or one man shall not think 
himself  above  another;  therefore 
I say unto you it is not expedient 
that ye should have a king.

8 Nevertheless, if it a were possible 
that ye could always have just men 
to be your b kings it would be well 
for you to have a king.

9 But remember the  a iniquity of 
king  Noah  and  his  b priests;  and  I 
myself was c caught in a snare, and 
did many things which were abomi-
nable in the sight of the Lord, which 
caused me sore d repentance;

10 Nevertheless,  a after  much 
b tribu lation, the Lord did hear my 
cries, and did answer my prayers, 
and  has  made  me  an  c instrument 
in his hands in bringing d so many 
of you to a knowledge of his truth.
11 Nevertheless,  in  this  I  do  not 
glory, for I am unworthy to glory 
of myself.

12 And now I say unto you, ye have 
been a oppressed by king Noah, and 
have been in bondage to him and his 
priests, and have been b brought into  
iniquity by them; therefore ye were 
bound with the c bands of iniquity.
13 And now as ye have been deliv-
ered by the power of God out of these  

bonds; yea, even out of the a hands of 
king Noah and his people, and also 
from the b bonds of iniquity, even so 
I desire that ye should  c stand fast 
in this d liberty wherewith ye have 
been made free, and that ye trust 
e no man to be a king over you.

14 And also trust no one to be your  
a teacher nor your minister, except 
he be a man of God, walking in his 
ways  and  keeping  his  command-
ments.

15 Thus did Alma teach his peo-
ple,  that  every  man  should  a love 
his b neighbor c as himself, that there 
should  be  no  d contention  among 
them.

16 And now, Alma was their a high 
priest, he being the founder of their 
church.

17 And it came to pass that none 
received a authority to preach or to 
teach except it were by him from 
God. Therefore he b consecrated all 
their priests and all their teachers; 
and none were consecrated except 
they were just men.

18 Therefore they did watch over 
their people, and did a nourish them 
with  things  pertaining  to  righ-
teousness.

19 And it came to pass that they 
began  to  prosper  exceedingly  in 
the land; and they called the land 
a Helam.

20 And it came to pass that they 
did multiply and prosper exceed-
ingly in the land of Helam; and they 
built a city, which they called the 
city of Helam.

to a chasten his people; yea, he tri-
eth their b patience and their faith.
22 Nevertheless—whosoever put-
teth his a trust in him the same shall 
be  b lifted  up  at  the  last  day.  Yea, 
and thus it was with this people.

23 For  behold,  I  will  show  unto 
you  that  they  were  brought  into 
a bondage, and none could deliver 
them but the Lord their God, yea, 
even the God of Abraham and Isaac 
and of Jacob.

24 And it came to pass that he did 
deliver them, and he did show forth 
his mighty power unto them, and 
great were their rejoicings.

25 For behold, it came to pass that 
while they were in the land of He-
lam, yea, in the city of Helam, while 
tilling the land round about, behold 
an  army  of  the  Lamanites  was  in 
the borders of the land.

26 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brethren of Alma fled from their 
fields,  and  gathered  themselves 
together in the city of Helam; and 
they were much frightened because 
of the appearance of the Lamanites.
27 But Alma went forth and stood 
among  them,  and  exhorted  them 
that they should not be frightened, 
but that they should remember the 
Lord  their  God  and  he  would  de-
liver them.

28 Therefore  they  hushed  their 
fears,  and  began  to  cry  unto  the 
Lord that he would soften the hearts 
of the Lamanites, that they would 
spare  them,  and  their  wives,  and 
their children.

29 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  did  soften  the  hearts  of  the 
Lamanites. And Alma and his breth-
ren went forth and delivered them-
selves up into their hands; and the 
Lamanites  took  possession  of  the 
land of Helam.

30 Now the a armies of the Laman-

ites, which had followed after the 
people of king Limhi, had been lost 
in the wilderness for many days.

31 And  behold,  they  had  found 
those  priests  of  king  Noah,  in  a 
place which they called  a Amulon; 
and they had begun to possess the 
land of Amulon and had begun to 
till the ground.

32 Now the name of the leader of 

those priests was a Amulon.

33 And it came to pass that Amulon 
did plead with the Lamanites; and 
he also sent forth their wives, who 
were the a daughters of the Laman-
ites, to plead with their brethren, 
that they should not destroy their 
husbands.

34 And the Lamanites had a com-
passion on Amulon and his brethren, 
and did not destroy them, because  
of their wives.

35 And a Amulon and his brethren 
did  join  the  Lamanites,  and  they 
were traveling in the wilderness in 
search of the land of Nephi when 
they discovered the land of Helam, 
which was possessed by Alma and 
his brethren.

36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites promised unto Alma and 
his brethren, that if they would show 
them the a way which led to the land  
of Nephi that they would grant unto 
them their lives and their liberty.
37 But  after  Alma  had  shown 
them the way that led to the land 
of Nephi the Lamanites would not 
keep  their  promise;  but  they  set 
a guards  round  about  the  land  of 
Helam, over Alma and his brethren.
38 And  the  remainder  of  them 
went  to  the  land  of  Nephi;  and  a 
part of them returned to the land 
of  Helam,  and  also  brought  with 
them  the  wives  and  the  children 
of the guards who had been left in  
the land.

39 And the king of the Lamanites 
had granted unto Amulon that he 
should be a king and a ruler over 
his  people,  who  were  in  the  land 
of  Helam;  nevertheless  he  should 
have no power to do anything con-
trary to the will of the king of the 
Lamanites.

CHAPTER 24
Amulon persecutes Alma and his peo-
ple—They are to be put to death if they 
pray—The Lord makes their burdens 
seem  light—He  delivers  them  from 
bondage, and they return to Zarahemla. 
About 145–120 b.c.
And it came to pass that Amulon 
did  gain  favor  in  the  eyes  of  the 
king  of  the  Lamanites;  therefore, 
the king of the Lamanites granted 
unto him and his brethren that they 
should be appointed teachers over 
his people, yea, even over the people 
who were in the land of Shemlon, 
and in the land of Shilom, and in 
the a land of Amulon.

2 For the Lamanites had taken pos-
session of all these lands; therefore, 
the king of the Lamanites had ap-
pointed kings over all these lands.
3 And now the name of the king 
of the Lamanites was a Laman, be-
ing  called  after  the  name  of  his 
father; and therefore he was called 
king Laman. And he was king over 
a numerous people.

4 And he appointed  a teachers of 
the b brethren of Amulon in every 
land  which  was  possessed  by  his 
people; and thus the  c language of 
Nephi began to be taught among all 
the people of the Lamanites.

5 And they were a people friendly 
one  with  another;  nevertheless 
they knew not God; neither did the 
brethren  of  Amulon  teach  them 
anything concerning the Lord their 

God, neither the law of Moses; nor 
did they teach them the words of  
Abinadi;

6 But they taught them that they 
should keep their record, and that 
they might write one to another.

7 And thus the Lamanites began 
to increase in riches, and began to 
a trade  one  with  another  and  wax 
great, and began to be a cunning 
and a wise people, as to the wisdom 
of the world, yea, a very cunning 
people, delighting in all manner of 
wickedness and plunder, except it 
were among their own brethren.

8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
a Amulon began to exercise b author-
ity over Alma and his brethren, and 
began to persecute him, and cause 
that his children should persecute 
their children.

9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he 
had been a one of the king’s priests, 
and that it was he that believed the 
words of Abinadi and was driven 
out before the king, and therefore 
he was wroth with him; for he was 
subject to king Laman, yet he exer-
cised authority over them, and put 
b tasks  upon  them,  and  put  c task-
masters over them.

10 And it came to pass that so great 
were their afflictions that they be-
gan to cry mightily to God.

11 And Amulon commanded them 
that they should stop their cries; and  
he a put guards over them to watch 
them,  that  whosoever  should  be 
found  calling  upon  God  should  
be put to death.

12 And Alma and his people did 
not  raise  their  voices  to  the  Lord 
their  God,  but  did  pour  out  their 
a hearts to him; and he did know the 
b thoughts of their hearts.

13 And it  a came to pass that the 
voice of the Lord came to them in 
their  afflictions,  saying:  Lift  up

your heads and be of good comfort, 
for I know of the covenant which 
ye have made unto me; and I will 
covenant with my people and de-
liver them out of bondage.

14 And I will also ease the  a bur-
dens  which  are  put  upon  your 
shoulders, that even you cannot feel 
them upon your backs, even while 
you are in bondage; and this will I 
do that ye may stand as b witnesses 
for me hereafter, and that ye may 
know  of  a  surety  that  I,  the  Lord 
God,  do  visit  my  people  in  their  
c afflictions.

15 And now it came to pass that 
the burdens which were laid upon 
Alma and his brethren were made 
light; yea, the Lord did a strengthen 
them that they could bear up their 
b burdens  with  ease,  and  they  did 
submit  cheerfully  and  with  c pa-
tience to all the will of the Lord.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  so 
great was their faith and their pa-
tience  that  the  voice  of  the  Lord 
came unto them again, saying: Be 
of good comfort, for on the morrow 
I will deliver you out of bondage.

17 And he said unto Alma: Thou 
shalt  go  before  this  people,  and  I 
will go a with thee and deliver this 
people out of b bondage.

18 Now it came to pass that Alma 
and  his  people  in  the  night-time 
gathered their flocks together, and 
also of their grain; yea, even all the 
night-time were they gathering their 
flocks together.

19 And in the morning the Lord 
caused a a deep sleep to come upon 
the  Lamanites,  yea,  and  all  their 
task-masters  were  in  a  profound  
sleep.

20 And Alma and his people de-
parted  into  the  wilderness;  and 
when  they  had  traveled  all  day 
they pitched their tents in a valley, 

and  they  called  the  valley  Alma, 
because  he  led  their  way  in  the  
wilderness.

21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma 
they  poured  out  their  a thanks  to 
God because he had been merciful 
unto  them,  and  eased  their  b bur-
dens, and had delivered them out 
of bondage; for they were in bond-
age, and none could deliver them 
except it were the Lord their God.
22 And they gave a thanks to God, 
yea,  all  their  men  and  all  their 
women and all their children that 
could  speak  lifted  their  voices  in 
the praises of their God.

23 And  now  the  Lord  said  unto 
Alma: Haste thee and get thou and 
this people out of this land, for the 
Lamanites have awakened and do 
pursue thee; therefore get thee out 
of  this  land,  and  I  will  stop  the 
Lamanites in this valley that they 
come no further in pursuit of this  
people.

24 And it came to pass that they 
departed out of the valley, and took 
their journey into the wilderness.
25 And  after  they  had  been  in 
the  wilderness  a twelve  days  they 
arrived in the land of Zarahemla; 
and king Mosiah did also b receive 
them with joy.

Nephi, as there were of the a people 
of  Zarahemla,  who  was  a  descen-
dant of b Mulek, and those who came  
with him into the wilderness.

3 And there were not so many of 
the people of Nephi and of the peo-
ple of Zarahemla as there were of 
the Lamanites; yea, they were not 
half so numerous.

4 And now all the people of Nephi 
were assembled together, and also 
all  the  people  of  Zarahemla,  and 
they  were  gathered  together  in 
two bodies.

5 And it came to pass that Mosiah 
did read, and caused to be read, the 
records of Zeniff to his people; yea, 
he read the records of the people 
of Zeniff, from the time they a left 
the  land  of  Zarahemla  until  they 
b returned again.

6 And  he  also  read  the  account 
of Alma and his brethren, and all 
their afflictions, from the time they 
left the land of Zarahemla until the 
time they returned again.

7 And now, when Mosiah had made 
an end of reading the records, his 
people who tarried in the land were 
struck with wonder and amazement.
8 For they knew not what to think; 
for  when  they  beheld  those  that 
had been delivered a out of bondage 
they were filled with exceedingly 
great joy.

9 And again, when they thought of 
their brethren who had been a slain 
by the Lamanites they were filled 
with sorrow, and even shed many 
tears of sorrow.

10 And again, when they thought  
of  the  immediate  goodness  of  
God,  and  his  power  in  delivering 
Alma and his brethren out of the 
hands  of  the  Lamanites  and  of 
a bondage, they did raise their voices 
and give thanks to God.

11 And again, when they thought 
upon the Lamanites, who were their 
brethren, of their sinful and a pol-
luted  state,  they  were  filled  with 
b pain and anguish for the c welfare 
of their souls.

12 And it came to pass that those 
who a were the children of Amulon 
and his brethren, who had taken to  
wife  the  b daughters  of  the  La-
manites, were displeased with the 
conduct of their fathers, and they 
would no longer be called by the 
names  of  their  fathers,  therefore 
they  took  upon  themselves  the 
name of Nephi, that they might be  
called  the  children  of  Nephi  and  
be  numbered  among  those  who 
were c called Nephites.

13 And  now  all  the  people  of  
Zarahemla  were  a numbered  with 
the Nephites, and this because the 
kingdom had been conferred upon 
none but those who were descen-
dants of Nephi.

14 And now it came to pass that 
when Mosiah had made an end of 
speaking  and  reading  to  the  peo-
ple,  he  desired  that  Alma  should 
also speak to the people.

15 And Alma did speak unto them, 
when they were assembled together 
in large bodies, and he went from 
one body to another, preaching unto 
the people repentance and faith on 
the Lord.

16 And he did exhort the people of  
Limhi and his brethren, all those that  
had been delivered out of bondage, 
that they should remember that it 
was the Lord that did deliver them.
17 And it came to pass that after 
Alma had taught the people many 
things,  and  had  made  an  end  of 
speaking to them, that king Limhi 
was  desirous  that  he  might  be 
baptized; and all his people were

desirous  that  they  might  be  bap-
tized also.

18 Therefore,  Alma  did  go  forth 
into  the  water  and  did  a baptize 
them; yea, he did baptize them after 
the manner he did his brethren in 
the b waters of Mormon; yea, and as 
many as he did baptize did belong 
to the church of God; and this be-
cause of their belief on the words  
of Alma.

19 And it came to pass that king 
Mosiah granted unto Alma that he 
might establish a churches through-
out all the land of Zarahemla; and 
gave him power to b ordain c priests 
and d teachers over every church.

20 Now  this  was  done  because 
there were so many people that they 
could  not  all  be  governed  by  one 
teacher; neither could they all hear 
the word of God in one assembly;

21 Therefore  they  did  a assemble 
themselves  together  in  different 
bodies, being called churches; every 
church having their priests and their 
teachers, and every priest preaching  
the word according as it was deliv-
ered to him by the mouth of Alma.
22 And  thus,  notwithstanding 
there  being  many  churches  they 
were all one a church, yea, even the 
church of God; for there was nothing 
preached in all the churches except 
it were repentance and faith in God.
23 And  now  there  were  seven 
churches in the land of Zarahemla. 
And it came to pass that whosoever 
were desirous to take upon them the 
a name of Christ, or of God, they did 
join the churches of God;

24 And they were called the a people  
of God. And the Lord did pour out 
his b Spirit upon them, and they were 
blessed, and prospered in the land.

CHAPTER 26

Many members of the Church are led 
into sin by unbelievers—Alma is prom-
ised eternal life—Those who repent and 
are baptized gain forgiveness—Church 
members in sin who repent and confess 
to Alma and to the Lord will be forgiven; 
otherwise,  they  will  not  be  numbered 
among the people of the Church. About 
120–100 b.c.
Now it came to pass that there were 
many of the rising generation that 
could not understand the a words of 
king Benjamin, being little children 
at the time he spake unto his peo-
ple; and they did  b not believe the 
tradition of their fathers.

2 They did not believe what had 
been said concerning the resurrec-
tion of the dead, neither did they 
believe concerning the coming of 
Christ.

3 And now because of their  a un-
belief they could not b understand 
the word of God; and their hearts 
were hardened.

4 And they would not be baptized; 
neither would they join the a church. 
And  they  were  a  separate  people 
as to their faith, and remained so 
ever after, even in their b carnal and 
sinful state; for they would not call 
upon the Lord their God.

5 And now in the reign of Mosiah  
they  were  not  half  so  numerous 
as  the  people  of  God;  but  be-
cause  of  the  a dissensions  among 
the  brethren  they  became  more  
numerous.

6 For it came to pass that they did 
a deceive many with their b flattering 
words, who were in the church, and 
did  cause  them  to  commit  many 
sins; therefore it became expedient

MOSIAH 26  : 7–23

that those who committed sin, that 
were in the church, should be c ad-
monished by the church.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were brought before the priests, and 
delivered  up  unto  the  a priests  by  
the teachers; and the priests brought 
them  before  Alma,  who  was  the 
b high priest.

8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma 

the a authority over the b church.

9 And it came to pass that Alma 
did  not  know  concerning  them; 
but  there  were  many  a witnesses 
against them; yea, the people stood 
and  testified  of  their  iniquity  in  
abundance.

10 Now  there  had  not  any  such 
thing  happened  before  in  the 
church;  therefore  Alma  was  trou-
bled in his spirit, and he caused that 
they should be brought before the  
king.

11 And  he  said  unto  the  king: 
Behold,  here  are  many  whom  we 
have brought before thee, who are 
accused of their brethren; yea, and 
they have been taken in divers in-
iquities. And they do not repent of 
their iniquities; therefore we have 
brought them before thee, that thou 
mayest  judge  them  according  to 
their crimes.

12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma: 
Behold, I judge them not; therefore 
I  a deliver  them  into  thy  hands  to 
be judged.

13 And now the spirit of Alma was 
again troubled; and he went and in-
quired of the Lord what he should 
do  concerning  this  matter,  for  he 
feared that he should do wrong in 
the sight of God.

14 And it came to pass that after 

he had poured out his whole soul 
to God, the a voice of the Lord came 
to him, saying:

15 Blessed  art  thou,  Alma,  and 
blessed are they who were baptized 
in the a waters of Mormon. Thou art 
blessed  because  of  thy  exceeding 
b faith  in  the  words  alone  of  my 
servant Abinadi.

16 And blessed are they because of 
their exceeding faith in the words 
alone which thou hast spoken unto 
them.

17 And blessed art thou because 
thou  hast  established  a  a church 
among this people; and they shall 
be  established,  and  they  shall  be 
my people.

18 Yea, blessed is this people who 
are willing to bear my  a name; for 
in my  b name shall they be called; 
and they are mine.

19 And because thou hast inquired 
of me concerning the transgressor, 
thou art blessed.

20 Thou art my servant; and I cov-
enant with thee that thou shalt have 
a eternal life; and thou shalt serve 
me and go forth in my name, and 
shalt gather together my sheep.

21 And he that will hear my voice 
shall be my a sheep; and him shall 
ye receive into the church, and him 
will I also receive.

22 For behold, a this is my b church; 
whosoever is c baptized shall be bap-
tized unto repentance. And whom-
soever ye receive shall d believe in 
my  name;  and  him  will  I  freely  
e forgive.

23 For it is I that taketh upon me  
the a sins of the world; for it is I that  
hath b created them; and it is I that 
granteth  unto  him  that  believeth

unto  the  end  a  place  at  my  right 
hand.

24 For behold, in my name are they 
called; and if they a know me they 
shall come forth, and shall have a 
place eternally at my right hand.

25 And it shall come to pass that 
when the a second trump shall sound 
then  shall  they  that  never  b knew 
me come forth and shall stand be-
fore me.

26 And then shall they know that 
I am the Lord their God, that I am 
their Redeemer; but they would not 
be redeemed.

27 And  then  I  will  confess  unto 
them that I never a knew them; and 
they shall b depart into c everlasting 
fire prepared for the devil and his 
angels.

28 Therefore I say unto you, that 
he that will not a hear my voice, the 
same shall ye not receive into my 
church, for him I will not receive 
at the last day.

29 Therefore I say unto you, Go; 
and whosoever transgresseth against 
me, him shall ye a judge b according 
to the sins which he has commit-
ted; and if he c confess his sins be-
fore  thee  and  me,  and  d repenteth 
in  the  sincerity  of  his  heart,  him 
shall ye e forgive, and I will forgive  
him also.

30 Yea, and a as often as my people 
b repent  will  I  forgive  them  their 
trespasses against me.

31 And ye shall also a forgive one 
another your trespasses; for verily 
I  say  unto  you,  he  that  forgiveth 
not his b neighbor’s trespasses when 
he says that he repents, the same 

hath  brought  himself  under  con-
demnation.

32 Now  I  say  unto  you,  Go;  and 
whosoever will  a not repent of his 
sins the same shall not be numbered 
among my people; and this shall be 
observed from this time forward.

33 And it came to pass when Alma 
had  heard  these  words  he  a wrote 
them  down  that  he  might  have 
them, and that he might judge the 
people of that church according to 
the commandments of God.

34 And it came to pass that Alma 
went  and  judged  those  that  had 
been taken in iniquity, according 
to the a word of the Lord.

35 And  whosoever  repented  of 
their  sins  and  did  a confess  them, 
them  he  did  number  among  the 
people of the church;

36 And those that would not con-
fess their sins and repent of their in-
iquity, the same were not numbered 
among  the  people  of  the  church, 
and their names were a blotted out.
37 And it came to pass that Alma 
did  regulate  all  the  affairs  of  the 
church;  and  they  began  again  to 
have peace and to prosper exceed-
ingly  in  the  affairs  of  the  church, 
walking circumspectly before God, 
receiving many, and baptizing many.
38 And  now  all  these  things  did 
Alma  and  his  a fellow  laborers  do 
who were over the church, b walking 
in all diligence, teaching the word 
of God in all things, suffering all 
manner  of  afflictions,  being  per-
secuted  by  all  those  who  did  not 
belong to the church of God.

brethren; and they were also  a ad-
monished, every one by the word 
of God, according to his sins, or to 
the sins which he had committed, 
being commanded of God to b pray 
without ceasing, and to give c thanks 
in all things.

CHAPTER 27

Mosiah forbids persecution and enjoins 
equality—Alma  the  younger  and  the 
four  sons  of  Mosiah  seek  to  destroy 
the  Church—An  angel  appears  and 
commands  them  to  cease  their  evil 
course—Alma  is  struck  dumb—All 
mankind must be born again to gain 
salvation —Alma  and  the  sons  of 
Mosiah  declare  glad  tidings.  About 
100–92 b.c.

And now it came to pass that the 
persecutions which were inflicted 
on the church by the unbelievers 
became  so  great  that  the  church 
began  to  murmur,  and  complain 
to  their  leaders  concerning  the 
matter; and they did complain to 
Alma. And Alma laid the case be-
fore their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah 
a consulted with his priests.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Mosiah sent a proclamation through-
out the land round about that there 
should not any unbeliever a perse-
cute any of those who belonged to 
the church of God.

3 And there was a strict command 
throughout  all  the  churches  that 
there  should  be  no  a persecutions 
among them, that there should be 
an b equality among all men;

4 That they should let no pride nor 
haughtiness  disturb  their  a peace; 
that every man should b esteem his 

c neighbor as himself, d laboring with 
their own hands for their support.
5 Yea,  and  all  their  priests  and 
teachers a should b labor with their 
own  hands  for  their  support,  in 
all  cases  save  it  were  in  sickness, 
or in much want; and doing these 
things, they did abound in the c grace  
of God.

6 And  there  began  to  be  much 
peace  again  in  the  land;  and  the 
people began to be very numerous,  
and began to scatter abroad upon the  
face of the earth, yea, on the north 
and on the south, on the east and on 
the west, building large cities and 
villages in all quarters of the land.
7 And the Lord did a visit them and 
b prosper them, and they became a 
large and wealthy people.

8 Now  the  sons  of  Mosiah  were 
numbered among the a unbelievers; 
and also one of the sons of Alma was  
numbered  among  them,  he  being 
called Alma, after his father; never-
theless, he became a very wicked 
and  an  b idolatrous  man.  And  he 
was a man of many words, and did 
speak much c flattery to the people; 
therefore he d led many of the peo-
ple to do after the manner of his 
e iniquities.

9 And he became a great hinder-
ment to the prosperity of the church 
of God; a stealing away the hearts of 
the people; causing much dissension 
among the people; giving a chance 
for  the  enemy  of  God  to  exercise 
his b power over them.

10 And now it came to pass that 
while he was going about to a destroy 
the  church  of  God,  for  he  did  go 
about secretly with the sons of Mo-
siah seeking to destroy the church,

and to lead astray the people of the 
Lord,  contrary  to  the  command-
ments of God, or even the king—

11 And as I said unto you, as they 
were going about a rebelling against 
God, behold, the b angel of the Lord 
c appeared  unto  them;  and  he  de-
scended as it were in a d cloud; and 
he spake as it were with a voice of 
thunder, which caused the earth to 
shake upon which they stood;

12 And so great was their aston-
ishment, that they fell to the earth, 
and understood not the words which 
he spake unto them.

13 Nevertheless he cried again, say-
ing: Alma, arise and stand forth, for 
why persecutest thou the church of 
God? For the Lord hath said: a This 
is my church, and I will establish 
it;  and  nothing  shall  b overthrow 
it,  save  it  is  the  transgression  of  
my people.

14 And  again,  the  angel  said:  
Behold,  the  Lord  hath  a heard  the  
prayers  of  his  people,  and  also  
the  b prayers of his servant, Alma, 
who is thy father; for he has c prayed 
with  much  faith  concerning  thee 
that  thou  mightest  be  brought  to 
the d knowledge of the truth; there-
fore, for this purpose have I come 
to e convince thee of the power and 
authority of God, that the f prayers 
of his servants might be answered 
according to their faith.

15 And  now  behold,  can  ye  dis-
pute  the  power  of  God?  For  be-
hold, doth not my voice shake the 
earth?  And  can  ye  not  also  a be-
hold me before you? And I am sent  
from God.

16 Now  I  say  unto  thee:  Go,  and  

remember  the  captivity  of  thy 
fathers in the land of a Helam, and 
in the land of Nephi; and remember 
how great things he has done for 
them;  for  they  were  in  b bondage, 
and  he  has  c delivered  them.  And 
now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy 
way, and seek to destroy the church 
no more, that their prayers may be 
answered, and this even if thou wilt 
of d thyself be e cast off.

17 And now it came to pass that 
these  were  the  last  words  which 
the  angel  spake  unto  Alma,  and 
he departed.

18 And now Alma and those that 
were  with  him  fell  again  to  the 
earth,  for  great  was  their  aston-
ishment;  for  with  their  own  eyes 
they  had  beheld  an  a angel  of  the 
Lord; and his voice was as thunder, 
which  b shook  the  earth;  and  they 
knew that there was nothing save 
the power of God that could shake 
the  earth  and  cause  it  to  tremble 
as though it would part asunder.

19 And now the astonishment of 
Alma was so great that he became 
a dumb, that he could not open his 
mouth; yea, and he became weak, 
even  that  he  could  not  move  his 
hands; therefore he was taken by 
those that were with him, and car-
ried helpless, even until he was laid 
before his father.

20 And  they  rehearsed  unto  his 
father all that had happened unto 
them; and his father rejoiced, for 
he  knew  that  it  was  the  power  
of God.

21 And he caused that a multitude 
should  be  gathered  together  that 
they might witness what the Lord

MOSIAH 27  : 22–32

had done for his son, and also for 
those that were with him.

22 And he caused that the priests 
should  assemble  themselves  to-
gether;  and  they  began  to  fast, 
and to pray to the Lord their God 
that he would open the mouth of 
Alma, that he might speak, and also 
that his limbs might receive their 
strength—that the eyes of the people 
might be opened to see and know 
of the goodness and glory of God.
23 And it came to pass after they 
had  fasted  and  prayed  for  the 
space of a two days and two nights, 
the  limbs  of  Alma  received  their 
strength, and he stood up and be-
gan  to  speak  unto  them,  bidding 
them to be of good comfort:

24 For, said he, I have repented of 
my sins, and have been a redeemed 
of  the  Lord;  behold  I  am  born  of 
the Spirit.

25 And the Lord said unto me: Mar-
vel not that all mankind, yea, men 
and women, all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and people, must be a born 
again; yea, b born of God, c changed 
from their carnal and d fallen state, 
to a state of righteousness, being re-
deemed of God, becoming his e sons 
and daughters;

26 And  thus  they  become  new 
creatures; and unless they do this, 
they  can  in  a nowise  inherit  the 
kingdom of God.

27 I say unto you, unless this be 
the case, they must be cast off; and 
this I know, because I was like to 
be cast off.

28 Nevertheless,  after  a wading 
through much b tribulation, repent-
ing  nigh  unto  death,  the  Lord  in 

mercy  hath  seen  fit  to  snatch  me 
out of an c everlasting burning, and 
I am born of God.

29 My soul hath been a redeemed 
from  the  gall  of  bitterness  and 
b bonds  of  iniquity.  I  was  in  the 
darkest  abyss;  but  now  I  behold 
the marvelous light of God. My soul 
was c racked with eternal torment; 
but I am snatched, and my soul is 
d pained no more.

30 I  rejected  my  Redeemer,  and 
denied that which had been spoken 
of by our fathers; but now that they 
may foresee that he will come, and 
that  he  remembereth  every  crea-
ture of his creating, he will make 
himself manifest unto a all.

31 Yea, a every knee shall bow, and 
every  tongue  confess  before  him. 
Yea, even at the last day, when all 
men  shall  stand  to  be  b judged  of 
him,  then  shall  they  confess  that 
he is c God; then shall they confess, 
who live d without God in the world, 
that  the  judgment  of  an  everlast-
ing punishment is just upon them; 
and they shall quake, and tremble, 
and shrink beneath the glance of 
his e all-searching eye.

32 And now it came to pass that 
Alma began from this time forward 
to teach the people, and those who 
were  with  Alma  at  the  time  the 
angel  appeared  unto  them,  trav-
eling round about through all the 
land, publishing to all the people 
the  things  which  they  had  heard 
and seen, and preaching the word 
of God in much tribulation, being 
greatly  persecuted  by  those  who 
were unbelievers, being smitten by 
many of them.

33 But  notwithstanding  all  this, 
they did impart much consolation 
to  the  church,  confirming  their 
faith, and exhorting them with long- 
suffering and much travail to keep  
the commandments of God.

34 And four of them were the a sons 
of  Mosiah;  and  their  names  were 
Ammon,  and  Aaron,  and  Omner, 
and Himni; these were the names 
of the sons of Mosiah.

35 And  they  traveled  through-
out all the land of Zarahemla, and 
among  all  the  a people  who  were 
under  the  reign  of  king  Mosiah, 
b zealously striving to repair all the 
injuries which they had done to the 
church,  c confessing  all  their  sins, 
and publishing all the things which 
they had seen, and explaining the 
prophecies and the scriptures to all 
who desired to hear them.

36 And  thus  they  were  instru-
ments in the hands of God in bring-
ing many to the knowledge of the 
truth, yea, to the knowledge of their  
Redeemer.

37 And how blessed are they! For 
they did a publish b peace; they did 
publish good tidings of good; and 
they  did  declare  unto  the  people 
that the Lord reigneth.

CHAPTER 28

The sons of Mosiah go to preach to the 
Lamanites—Using the two seer stones, 
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates. 
About 92 b.c.
Now it came to pass that after the 
a sons of Mosiah had done all these 
things, they took a small number 
with  them  and  returned  to  their 
father,  the  king,  and  desired  of 
him that he would grant unto them  

that they might, with these whom 
they had b selected, go up to the land 
of  c Nephi  that  they  might  preach 
the things which they had heard, 
and  that  they  might  impart  the 
word of God to their brethren, the  
Lamanites—

2 a That perhaps they might bring 
them to the knowledge of the Lord 
their God, and convince them of the 
iniquity of their fathers; and that 
perhaps  they  might  cure  them  of 
their b hatred towards the Nephites, 
that they might also be brought to 
rejoice in the Lord their God, that 
they  might  become  friendly  to 
one another, and that there should 
be no more contentions in all the 
land which the Lord their God had 
given them.

3 Now they were desirous that sal-
vation should be declared to every 
creature, for they could not  a bear 
that any human b soul should c per-
ish; yea, even the very thoughts that 
any  soul  should  endure  d endless 
torment did cause them to quake 
and e tremble.

4 And  thus  did  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord work upon them, for they were 
the very a vilest of sinners. And the 
Lord saw fit in his infinite b mercy 
to  spare  them;  nevertheless  they 
suffered much anguish of soul be-
cause of their iniquities, suffering 
much and fearing that they should 
be cast off forever.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did plead with their father many 
days that they might go up to the 
land of Nephi.

6 And king Mosiah went and a in-
quired of the Lord if he should let 
his sons go up among the Laman-
ites to preach the word.

MOSIAH 28  : 7–20

7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: 
Let  them  go  up,  for  many  shall 
believe  on  their  words,  and  they 
shall  have  eternal  life;  and  I  will 
a deliver thy sons out of the hands 
of the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that Mosiah 
granted that they might go and do 
according to their request.

9 And they a took their journey into 
the wilderness to go up to preach 
the  word  among  the  Lamanites; 
and I shall give an b account of their 
proceedings hereafter.

10 Now king Mosiah had no one to 
confer the kingdom upon, for there 
was not any of his sons who a would 
accept of the kingdom.

11 Therefore he took the records 
which were engraven on the plates 
of  a brass,  and  also  the  plates  of 
b Nephi, and all the things which he 
had kept and preserved according 
to the commandments of God, after 
having translated and caused to be 
written the records which were on 
the c plates of gold which had been 
found by the people of Limhi, which 
were delivered to him by the hand 
of Limhi;

12 And this he did because of the 
great anxiety of his people; for they 
were desirous beyond measure to 
know concerning those people a who 
had been destroyed.

13 And  now  he  translated  them 
by the means of those two a stones 
which were fastened into the two 
rims of a bow.

14 Now these things were prepared  
from  the  beginning,  and  were 
handed  down  from  generation  to 
generation, for the purpose of in-
terpreting languages;

15 And they have been kept and 
preserved by the hand of the Lord, 
that  he  should  discover  to  every 
creature  who  should  possess  the 
land  the  iniquities  and  abomina-
tions of his people;

16 And whosoever has these things 
is called a seer, after the manner of 
old times.

17 Now after Mosiah had finished 
a translating these b records, behold, 
it  gave  an  account  of  the  people 
who were c destroyed, from the time 
that  they  were  destroyed  back  to 
the building of the d great tower, at 
the time the Lord e confounded the 
language  of  the  people  and  they 
were  scattered  abroad  upon  the 
face of all the earth, yea, and even 
from that time back until the cre-
ation of Adam.

18 Now this account did cause the 
people of Mosiah to mourn exceed-
ingly,  yea,  they  were  filled  with 
sorrow; nevertheless it gave them 
much knowledge, in the which they 
did rejoice.

19 And this account shall be a writ-
ten hereafter; for behold, it is expe-
dient that all people should know 
the  things  which  are  written  in 
this account.

20 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
that  after  king  Mosiah  had  done 
these things, he took the plates of 
a brass,  and  all  the  things  which 
he had kept, and b conferred them  
upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; 
yea,  all  the  records,  and  also  the 
c interpreters, and conferred them 
upon  him,  and  commanded  him 
that he should keep and d preserve 
them, and also keep a record of the 
people, handing them down from

one generation to another, even as 
they had been handed down from 
the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

CHAPTER 29
Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen 
in place of a king—Unrighteous kings 
lead  their  people  into  sin—Alma  the 
younger  is  chosen  chief  judge  by  the 
voice of the people—He is also the high 
priest over the Church—Alma the el-
der and Mosiah die. About 92–91 b.c.
Now  when  Mosiah  had  done  this 
he sent out throughout all the land, 
among  all  the  people,  desiring  to 
know  their  will  concerning  who 
should be their king.

2 And it came to pass that the voice 
of the people came, saying: We are 
desirous that Aaron thy son should 
be our king and our ruler.

3 Now Aaron had gone up to the 
land of Nephi, therefore the king 
could not confer the kingdom upon 
him;  a neither  would  Aaron  take 
upon him the kingdom; neither were 
any of the b sons of Mosiah c willing 
to take upon them the kingdom.

4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again  
among the people; yea, even a writ-
ten word sent he among the people. 
And these were the words that were 
written, saying:

5 Behold, O ye my people, or my 
brethren, for I esteem you as such, 
I desire that ye should consider the 
cause which ye are called to a con-
sider—for ye are desirous to have  
a king.

6 Now I declare unto you that he 
to whom the kingdom doth rightly 
belong has declined, and will not 
take upon him the kingdom.

7 And now if there should be an-
other appointed in his stead, behold 
I fear there would rise a contentions 

among you. And who knoweth but 
what  my  son,  to  whom  the  king-
dom  doth  belong,  should  turn  to 
be  angry  and  b draw  away  a  part 
of  this  people  after  him,  which 
would cause wars and contentions 
among  you,  which  would  be  the 
cause of shedding much blood and 
perverting  the  way  of  the  Lord, 
yea, and destroy the souls of many  
people.

8 Now I say unto you let us be wise 
and  consider  these  things,  for  we 
have  no  right  to  destroy  my  son, 
neither should we have any right 
to destroy another if he should be 
appointed in his stead.

9 And  if  my  son  should  turn 
again to his pride and vain things 
he  would  recall  the  things  which 
he had said, and claim his right to 
the  kingdom,  which  would  cause 
him  and  also  this  people  to  com-
mit much sin.

10 And  now  let  us  be  wise  and 
look forward to these things, and 
do  that  which  will  make  for  the 
peace of this people.

11 Therefore I will be your king 
the remainder of my days; never-
theless, let a us appoint b judges, to 
judge this people according to our 
law; and we will newly arrange the 
affairs  of  this  people,  for  we  will 
appoint wise men to be judges, that 
will judge this people according to 
the commandments of God.

12 Now  it  is  better  that  a  man 
should be  a judged of God than of 
man, for the judgments of God are 
always just, but the judgments of 
man are not always just.

13 Therefore, a if it were possible 
that you could have b just men to be 
your kings, who would establish the 
c laws of God, and judge this people 
according  to  his  commandments,

MOSIAH 29  : 14–26

yea, if ye could have men for your  
kings  who  would  do  even  as  my 
father  d Benjamin  did  for  this 
people—I say unto you, if this could  
always  be  the  case  then  it  would 
be expedient that ye should always 
have kings to rule over you.

14 And even I myself have labored 
with  all  the  power  and  faculties 
which  I  have  possessed,  to  teach 
you  the  commandments  of  God, 
and to establish peace throughout 
the land, that there should be no 
wars nor contentions, no stealing, 
nor plundering, nor murdering, nor 
any manner of iniquity;

15 And  whosoever  has  commit-
ted iniquity, him have I a punished 
according  to  the  crime  which  he 
has  committed,  according  to  the 
law which has been given to us by 
our fathers.

16 Now I say unto you, that because 
all men are not just it is not expe-
dient that ye should have a  a king 
or kings to rule over you.

17 For behold, how much a iniquity 
doth one b wicked king cause to be 
committed,  yea,  and  what  great 
destruction!

18 Yea, remember king Noah, his 
a wickedness and his abominations, 
and also the wickedness and abomi-
nations of his people. Behold what 
great  destruction  did  come  upon 
them;  and  also  because  of  their 
iniquities they were brought into 
b bondage.

19 And were it not for the inter-
position  of  their  all-wise  Creator, 
and  this  because  of  their  sincere 
repentance, they must unavoidably 
remain in bondage until now.

20 But behold, he did deliver them 

because  they  did  a humble  them-
selves before him; and because they 
b cried  mightily  unto  him  he  did 
deliver them out of bondage; and 
thus doth the Lord work with his 
power in all cases among the chil-
dren of men, extending the arm of 
c mercy towards them that put their 
d trust in him.

21 And  behold,  now  I  say  unto 
you, ye cannot dethrone an iniqui-
tous a king save it be through much 
contention,  and  the  shedding  of 
much blood.

22 For behold, he has his a friends 
in  iniquity,  and  he  keepeth  his 
guards about him; and he teareth up 
the laws of those who have reigned 
in righteousness before him; and he 
trampleth under his feet the com-
mandments of God;

23 And he enacteth laws, and send-
eth them forth among his people, 
yea, laws after the manner of his 
own  wickedness;  and  whosoever 
doth not obey his laws he a causeth 
to be destroyed; and whosoever doth 
rebel against him he will send his 
armies against them to war, and if 
he  can  he  will  destroy  them;  and 
thus an unrighteous b king doth per-
vert the ways of all righteousness.
24 And now behold I say unto you, 
it is not expedient that such abomi-
nations should come upon you.

25 Therefore,  choose  you  by  the 
a voice of this people, judges, that 
ye may be b judged according to the 
c laws  which  have  been  given  you 
by our fathers, which are correct, 
and which were given them by the 
hand of the Lord.

this shall ye observe and make it 
your law—to do your business by 
the voice of the people.

27 And  a if  the  time  comes  that 
the voice of the people doth choose 
iniquity, then is the time that the 
judgments of God will come upon 
you; yea, then is the time he will 
visit you with great destruction even 
as he has hitherto visited this land.
28 And now if ye have judges, and 
they do not a judge you according to 
the law which has been given, ye 
can cause that they may be judged 
of a higher judge.

29 If  your  higher  judges  do  not 
judge righteous judgments, ye shall 
cause that a small number of your 
lower  judges  should  be  gathered 
together, and they shall judge your 
higher judges, according to the voice 
of the people.

30 And I command you to do these 
things in the fear of the Lord; and 
I command you to do these things, 
and  that  ye  have  no  king;  that  if 
these people commit sins and iniq-
uities they shall be answered upon 
their own heads.

31 For behold I say unto you, the 
sins  of  many  people  have  been 
a caused  by  the  iniquities  of  their 
kings;  therefore  their  iniquities 
are  answered  upon  the  heads  of 
their kings.

32 And now I desire that this a in-
equality should be no more in this 
land, especially among this my peo-
ple; but I desire that this land be a 
land of b liberty, and c every man may 
enjoy his rights and privileges alike, 
so long as the Lord sees fit that we 
may live and inherit the land, yea, 

even as long as any of our posterity 
remains upon the face of the land.
33 And many more things did king 
Mosiah write unto them, unfolding 
unto them all the trials and a trou-
bles of a righteous king, yea, all the 
travails of soul for their people, and 
also all the murmurings of the peo-
ple to their king; and he explained 
it all unto them.

34 And  he  told  them  that  these 
things  ought  not  to  be;  but  that 
the burden should come upon all 
the people, that every man might 
a bear his part.

35 And he also unfolded unto them 
all the disadvantages they labored 
under,  by  having  an  unrighteous 
a king to rule over them;

36 Yea,  all  a his  iniquities  and 
abominations, and all the wars, and 
contentions, and bloodshed, and the 
stealing, and the plundering, and 
the committing of whoredoms, and 
all manner of iniquities which can-
not  be  enumerated—telling  them 
that these things ought not to be, 
that they were expressly repugnant 
to the commandments of God.

37 And now it came to pass, after 
king Mosiah had sent these things 
forth among the people they were 
a convinced of the truth of his words.
38 Therefore  they  relinquished 
their desires for a king, and became 
exceedingly  anxious  that  every 
man should have an equal a chance 
throughout  all  the  land;  yea,  and 
every man expressed a willingness 
to answer for his own sins.

39 Therefore, it came to pass that 
they assembled themselves together 
in bodies throughout the land, to 
cast in their a voices concerning who 
should  be  their  b judges,  to  judge 
them according to the c law which 
had been given them; and they were

MOSIAH 29  : 40–47

exceedingly rejoiced because of the 
d liberty  which  had  been  granted 
unto them.

40 And they did wax strong in love 
towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem  
him more than any other man; for 
they  did  not  look  upon  him  as  a  
a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, 
for that b lucre which doth c corrupt 
the soul; for he had not exacted riches 
of them, neither had he delighted in 
the shedding of blood; but he had 
established d peace in the land, and 
he had granted unto his people that 
they  should  be  delivered  from  all 
manner of bondage; therefore they 
did  esteem  him,  yea,  exceedingly,  
beyond measure.

41 And it came to pass that they did 
a appoint b judges to rule over them, 
or to judge them according to the 
law; and this they did throughout 
all the land.

42 And it came to pass that Alma 
was appointed to be the first a chief 
judge, he being also the b high priest, 
his father having conferred the of-
fice  upon  him,  and  having  given 

him the charge concerning all the 
affairs of the church.

43 And now it came to pass that 
Alma did a walk in the ways of the 
Lord, and he did keep his command-
ments, and he did judge righteous 
judgments; and there was continual 
peace through the land.

44 And thus commenced the a reign 
of the judges throughout all the land 
of  Zarahemla,  among  all  the  peo-
ple who were called the Nephites; 
and  Alma  was  the  first  and  chief  
judge.

45 And now it came to pass that 
his  father  died,  being  eighty  and 
two years old, having lived to fulfil 
the commandments of God.

46 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
siah  a died  also,  in  the  thirty  and 
third year of his reign, being b sixty 
and three years old; making in the 
whole, five hundred and nine years 
from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.
47 And thus ended the reign of the 
kings over the people of Nephi; and 
thus ended the days of Alma, who 
was the founder of their church.

NOW it came to pass that in 

the  first  year  of  the  reign  
of the judges over the people 
of Nephi, from this time forward, 
king Mosiah having a gone the way 
of  all  the  earth,  having  warred  a 
good  warfare,  walking  uprightly 
before God, leaving none to reign 
in  his  stead;  nevertheless  he  had 
established  b laws,  and  they  were 
acknowledged by the people; there-
fore they were obliged to abide by 
the c laws which he had made.

2 And it came to pass that in the 
first year of the reign of Alma in 
the judgment-seat, there was a a man 
brought before him to be judged, a 
man who was large, and was noted 
for his much strength.

3 And he had gone about among 
the people, preaching to them that 
which he  a termed to be the word 
of God, bearing down b against the 
church; declaring unto the people 
that every priest and teacher ought 
to become c popular; and they ought 
d not to labor with their hands, but 
that they ought to be supported by 
the people.

4 And  he  also  testified  unto  the 
people that a all mankind should be 
saved at the last day, and that they 
b need not fear nor tremble, but that 
they might lift up their heads and 
rejoice;  for  the  Lord  had  c created 
all men, and had also d redeemed e all  
men; and, in the end, all men should 
have eternal life.

5 And it came to pass that he did 
teach  these  things  so  much  that 
many  did  believe  on  his  words, 
even  so  many  that  they  began  to 
support him and give him a money.

6 And he began to be lifted up in 
the pride of his heart, and to wear 
very costly a apparel, yea, and even 
began to b establish a c church after 
the manner of his preaching.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  as  he  was 
going, to preach to those who be-
lieved on his word, he met a man 
who belonged to the church of God, 
yea,  even  one  of  their  a teachers; 
and he began to contend with him 
sharply,  that  he  might  lead  away 
the people of the church; but the 
man withstood him, admonishing 
him with the b words of God.

8 Now the name of the man was 
a Gideon; and it was he who was an 
instrument in the hands of God in 
delivering the people of Limhi out 
of bondage.

9 Now, because Gideon withstood 
him with the words of God he was 
wroth with Gideon, and drew his 
sword and began to smite him. Now 
Gideon being a stricken with many 
years, therefore he was not able to 
withstand his blows, therefore he 
was b slain by the sword.

10 And the man who slew him was 
taken by the people of the church, 
and  was  brought  before  Alma,  to 
be a judged according to the crimes 
which he had committed.

11 And it came to pass that he stood 
before Alma and pled for himself 
with much boldness.

12 But  Alma  said  unto  him:  Be-
hold,  this  is  the  first  time  that 
a priestcraft  has  been  introduced 
among  this  people.  And  behold, 
thou art not only guilty of priest-
craft,  but  hast  endeavored  to  en-
force  it  by  the  sword;  and  were

b priestcraft to be enforced among 
this  people  it  would  prove  their 
entire destruction.

13 And thou hast shed the a blood 
of a righteous man, yea, a man who 
has  done  much  good  among  this 
people; and were we to spare thee 
his blood would come upon us for 
b vengeance.

14 Therefore thou art condemned 
to a die, according to the b law which 
has been given us by Mosiah, our 
last king; and it has been c acknowl-
edged by this people; therefore this 
people must d abide by the law.

15 And it came to pass that they 
took him; and his name was a Nehor; 
and they carried him upon the top 
of the hill Manti, and there he was 
caused, or rather did acknowledge, 
between the heavens and the earth, 
that what he had taught to the peo-
ple was contrary to the word of God; 
and there he suffered an ignomini-
ous b death.

16 Nevertheless, this did not put an 
end to the spreading of priestcraft 
through  the  land;  for  there  were 
many  who  loved  the  vain  things 
of the world, and they went forth 
preaching  a false  doctrines;  and 
this they did for the sake of b riches  
and honor.

17 Nevertheless,  they  durst  not 
a lie,  if  it  were  known,  for  fear  of 
the  law,  for  liars  were  punished; 
therefore they pretended to preach 
according to their belief; and now 
the  law  could  have  no  power  on 
any man for b his belief.

18 And they durst not  a steal, for 
fear of the law, for such were pun-
ished; neither durst they rob, nor 

murder, for he that b murdered was 
punished unto c death.

19 But it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church 
of  God  began  to  persecute  those 
that  did  belong  to  the  church  of 
God, and had taken upon them the 
name of Christ.

20 Yea, they did persecute them, 
and afflict them with all manner 
of words, and this because of their 
humility;  because  they  were  not 
proud  in  their  own  eyes,  and  be-
cause  they  did  impart  the  word 
of God, one with another, without 
a money and without price.

21 Now  there  was  a  strict  law 
among the people of the church, that  
there should a not any man, belong-
ing to the church, arise and perse-
cute those that did not belong to the 
church,  and  that  there  should  be 
no persecution among themselves.
22 Nevertheless, there were many 
among them who began to be proud, 
and began to contend warmly with 
their adversaries, even unto blows; 
yea, they would smite one another 
with their a fists.

23 Now this was in the second year 
of the reign of Alma, and it was a  
cause  of  much  affliction  to  the 
church; yea, it was the cause of much  
trial with the church.

24 For  the  hearts  of  many  were 
hardened,  and  their  names  were 
a blotted out, that they were remem-
bered no more among the people 
of God. And also many b withdrew 
themselves from among them.

25 Now  this  was  a  great  trial  to 
those that did stand fast in the faith; 
nevertheless, they were  a steadfast

and  immovable  in  keeping  the 
commandments of God, and they 
bore with b patience the persecution 
which was heaped upon them.

26 And when the priests left their 
a labor to impart the word of God 
unto the people, the people also left 
their labors to hear the word of God. 
And when the priest had imparted 
unto  them  the  word  of  God  they 
all returned again diligently unto 
their labors; and the priest, not es-
teeming himself above his hearers, 
for the preacher was no better than 
the hearer, neither was the teacher 
any  better  than  the  learner;  and 
thus they were all equal, and they 
did all labor, every man b according 
to his strength.

27 And they did a impart of their 
substance,  every  man  according 
to that which he had, to the b poor, 
and  the  needy,  and  the  sick,  and 
the afflicted; and they did not wear 
costly c apparel, yet they were neat 
and comely.

28 And  thus  they  did  establish 
the affairs of the church; and thus 
they began to have continual peace 
again,  notwithstanding  all  their 
persecutions.

29 And now, because of the steadi-
ness  of  the  church  they  began  to 
be exceedingly a rich, having abun-
dance  of  all  things  whatsoever  
they stood in need—an abundance 
of flocks and herds, and fatlings of  
every kind, and also abundance of 
grain, and of gold, and of silver, and 
of precious things, and abundance  
of b silk and fine-twined linen, and 
all manner of good homely c cloth.
30 And thus, in their a prosperous 

circumstances,  they  did  not  send 
away any who were b naked, or that 
were hungry, or that were athirst, 
or that were sick, or that had not 
been nourished; and they did not 
set their hearts upon c riches; there-
fore they were d liberal to all, both 
old and young, both bond and free, 
both  male  and  female,  whether 
out of the church or in the church, 
having no e respect to persons as to 
those who stood in need.

31 And thus they did a prosper and 
become far more wealthy than those 
who did not belong to their church.
32 For those who did not belong  
to their church did indulge them-
selves in a sorceries, and in b idolatry 
or c idleness, and in d babblings, and 
in  e envyings  and  f strife;  wearing 
costly apparel; being g lifted up in  
the  pride  of  their  own  eyes;  per-
secuting, lying, thieving, robbing, 
committing whoredoms, and mur-
dering, and all manner of wicked-
ness; nevertheless, the law was put in  
force upon all those who did trans-
gress it, inasmuch as it was possible.
33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  by  
thus exercising the law upon them, 
every  man  suffering  according  to 
that which he had done, they became 
more  still,  and  durst  not  commit 
any  wickedness  if  it  were  known; 
therefore,  there  was  much  peace 
among the people of Nephi until the  
fifth year of the reign of the judges.

make war on the Nephites and are de-
feated—The Lamanites and Amlicites 
join  forces  and  are  defeated—Alma 
slays Amlici. About 87 b.c.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a voice of the people came against 
Amlici, that he was not made king 
over the people.

And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  com-
mencement of the fifth year of their 
reign there began to be a contention  
among  the  people;  for  a  certain 
a man, being called Amlici, he being  
a  very  cunning  man,  yea,  a  wise 
man as to the wisdom of the world, 
he being after the order of the man 
that slew b Gideon by the sword, who 
was executed according to the law—
2 Now this Amlici had, by his cun-
ning,  a drawn  away  much  people 
after him; even so much that they 
began to be very powerful; and they 
began to endeavor to establish Am-
lici to be a king over the people.

3 Now  this  was  alarming  to  the 
people of the church, and also to all 
those who had not been drawn away 
after  the  persuasions  of  Amlici;  
for they knew that according to their 
law that such things must be estab-
lished by the a voice of the people.
4 Therefore,  if  it  were  possible 
that Amlici should gain the voice 
of the people, he, being a wicked 
man, would a deprive them of their 
rights and privileges of the church; 
for it was his intent to destroy the 
church of God.

5 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple assembled themselves together 
throughout all the land, every man 
according to his mind, whether it 
were for or against Amlici, in sepa-
rate bodies, having much dispute 
and  wonderful  a contentions  one 
with another.

6 And  thus  they  did  assemble 
themselves together to cast in their 
a voices concerning the matter; and 
they were laid before the judges.

8 Now  this  did  cause  much  joy 
in  the  hearts  of  those  who  were 
against him; but Amlici did stir up 
those who were in his favor to anger 
against those who were not in his  
favor.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
gathered themselves together, and 
did a consecrate Amlici to be their 
king.

10 Now  when  Amlici  was  made 
king  over  them  he  commanded 
them that they should take up arms 
against  their  brethren;  and  this 
he did that he might subject them  
to him.

11 Now the people of Amlici were 
distinguished by the name of Am-
lici, being called a Amlicites; and the 
remainder  were  b called  Nephites, 
or the people of God.

12 Therefore  the  people  of  the 
Nephites were aware of the intent 
of the Amlicites, and therefore they  
did  prepare  to  meet  them;  yea,  
they did arm themselves with swords, 
and with cimeters, and with bows, and  
with arrows, and with stones, and 
with  slings,  and  with  all  manner  
of a weapons of war, of every kind.
13 And thus they were prepared 
to meet the Amlicites at the time 
of  their  coming.  And  there  were 
appointed  a captains,  and  higher 
captains,  and  chief  captains,  ac-
cording to their numbers.

14 And it came to pass that Amlici 
did arm his men with all manner of 
weapons of war of every kind; and 
he also appointed rulers and lead-
ers over his people, to lead them to 
war against their brethren.

Amlicites came upon the hill Am-
nihu, which was east of the a river 
Sidon,  which  ran  by  the  b land  of 
Zarahemla,  and  there  they  began 
to make war with the Nephites.

16 Now  Alma,  being  the  a chief 
judge and the b governor of the peo-
ple of Nephi, therefore he went up 
with his people, yea, with his cap-
tains,  and  chief  captains,  yea,  at 
the head of his armies, against the 
Amlicites to battle.

17 And they began to slay the Am-
licites upon the hill east of Sidon. 
And the Amlicites did contend with 
the  Nephites  with  great  strength, 
insomuch that many of the Neph-
ites did fall before the Amlicites.

18 Nevertheless  the  Lord  did 
strengthen the hand of the Nephites, 
that they slew the Amlicites with 
great slaughter, that they began to 
flee before them.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites did pursue the Amlicites 
all that day, and did slay them with 
much slaughter, insomuch that there 
were a slain of the Amlicites twelve 
thousand five hundred thirty and 
two souls; and there were slain of 
the Nephites six thousand five hun-
dred sixty and two souls.

20 And it came to pass that when 
Alma  could  pursue  the  Amlicites 
no longer he caused that his peo-
ple should pitch their tents in the 
a valley of Gideon, the valley being 
called after that Gideon who was 
slain by the hand of  b Nehor with 
the  sword;  and  in  this  valley  the 
Nephites did pitch their tents for  
the night.

21 And Alma sent spies to follow 
the remnant of the Amlicites, that 
he might know of their plans and 
their plots, whereby he might guard 
himself against them, that he might 
preserve  his  people  from  being  
destroyed.

22 Now those whom he had sent 
out to watch the camp of the Amli-
cites were called Zeram, and Amnor, 
and Manti, and Limher; these were 
they who went out with their men 
to watch the camp of the Amlicites.
23 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they returned into the camp 
of the Nephites in great haste, be-
ing greatly astonished, and struck 
with much fear, saying:

24 Behold, we followed the a camp 
of the b Amlicites, and to our great 
astonishment,  in  the  land  of  Mi-
non, above the land of Zarahemla, 
in the course of the land of c Nephi, 
we saw a numerous host of the La-
manites; and behold, the Amlicites 
have joined them;

25 And they are upon our brethren 
in that land; and they are fleeing 
before them with their flocks, and 
their wives, and their children, to-
wards our city; and except we make 
haste they obtain possession of our 
city, and our fathers, and our wives, 
and our children be slain.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people  of  Nephi  took  their  tents, 
and departed out of the valley of 
Gideon towards their  a city, which 
was the city of b Zarahemla.

27 And behold, as they were cross-
ing the river Sidon, the Lamanites 
and  the  Amlicites,  being  as  a nu-
merous  almost,  as  it  were,  as  the 
sands of the sea, came upon them 
to destroy them.

28 Nevertheless, the Nephites be-
ing  a strengthened by the hand of 
the Lord, having prayed mightily 
to him that he would deliver them 
out of the hands of their enemies, 
therefore  the  Lord  did  hear  their 
cries, and did strengthen them, and 
the  Lamanites  and  the  Amlicites 
did fall before them.

29 And it came to pass that Alma 
fought with Amlici with the sword,

face to face; and they did contend 
mightily, one with another.

30 And it came to pass that Alma, 
being a man of God, being exercised 
with much a faith, cried, saying: O 
Lord,  have  mercy  and  b spare  my 
life,  that  I  may  be  an  instrument 
in thy hands to save and preserve 
this people.

31 Now when Alma had said these 
words  he  contended  again  with 
Amlici; and he was strengthened, 
insomuch that he slew Amlici with 
the sword.

32 And he also contended with the 
king of the Lamanites; but the king 
of  the  Lamanites  fled  back  from 
before Alma and sent his guards to  
contend with Alma.

33 But Alma, with his guards, con-
tended with the guards of the king 
of the Lamanites until he slew and 
drove them back.

34 And thus he cleared the ground, 
or rather the bank, which was on the 
west of the river Sidon, throwing the 
bodies of the Lamanites who had 
been slain into the waters of Sidon, 
that thereby his people might have 
room to cross and contend with the 
Lamanites and the Amlicites on the 
west side of the river Sidon.

35 And it came to pass that when 
they had all crossed the river Sidon  
that the Lamanites and the Amlicites  
began to flee before them, notwith-
standing  they  were  so  numerous 
that they could not be numbered.
36 And they fled before the Neph-
ites towards the wilderness which 
was west and north, away beyond 
the  borders  of  the  land;  and  the 
Nephites did pursue them with their 
might, and did slay them.

37 Yea,  they  were  met  on  every 
hand, and slain and driven, until 
they were scattered on the west, and 
on the north, until they had reached 
the  wilderness,  which  was  called 
Hermounts; and it was that part of 

the wilderness which was infested 
by wild and ravenous beasts.

38 And it came to pass that many 
died  in  the  wilderness  of  their 
wounds, and were devoured by those  
beasts and also the vultures of the air; 
and their bones have been found, and 
have been heaped up on the earth.

CHAPTER 3
The Amlicites had marked themselves 
according to the prophetic word—The 
Lamanites  had  been  cursed  for  their 
rebellion—Men bring their own curses 
upon  themselves—The  Nephites  de-
feat  another  Lamanite  army.  About 
87– 86 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Nephites  
who were not a slain by the weapons  
of  war,  after  having  buried  those 
who had been slain—now the num-
ber of the slain were not numbered, 
because  of  the  greatness  of  their 
number—after  they  had  finished 
burying their dead they all returned 
to their lands, and to their houses, 
and their wives, and their children.
2 Now many women and children 
had been slain with the sword, and 
also many of their flocks and their 
herds; and also many of their fields of 
grain were destroyed, for they were 
trodden down by the hosts of men.
3 And now as many of the Laman-
ites and the Amlicites who had been 
slain upon the bank of the river Si-
don  were  cast  into  the  a waters  of 
Sidon; and behold their bones are 
in the depths of the b sea, and they 
are many.

4 And the a Amlicites were distin-
guished from the Nephites, for they 
had  b marked themselves with red 
in their foreheads after the manner 
of the Lamanites; nevertheless they 
had not shorn their heads like unto 
the Lamanites.

5 Now the heads of the Lamanites 
were shorn; and they were a naked,

save it were skin which was girded 
about  their  loins,  and  also  their  
armor,  which  was  girded  about 
them,  and  their  bows,  and  their 
arrows, and their stones, and their 
slings, and so forth.

6 And the skins of the Lamanites 
were dark, according to the mark 
which was set upon their fathers, 
which was a a curse upon them be-
cause  of  their  transgression  and 
their rebellion against their breth-
ren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, 
and Joseph, and Sam, who were just 
and holy men.

7 And  their  brethren  sought  to 
destroy them, therefore they were 
cursed;  and  the  Lord  God  set  a 
a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman 
and  Lemuel,  and  also  the  sons  of 
Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.
8 And this was done that their seed 
might  be  distinguished  from  the  
seed of their brethren, that thereby 
the  Lord  God  might  preserve  his 
people,  that  they  might  not  a mix 
and believe in incorrect b traditions 
which would prove their destruction.
9 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did mingle his seed with that 
of the Lamanites did bring the same 
curse upon his seed.

10 Therefore, whosoever suffered 
himself to be led away by the La-
manites  was  called  under  that 
head,  and  there  was  a  mark  set  
upon him.

11 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever would not believe in the a tradi-
tion of the Lamanites, but believed 
those records which were brought 
out of the land of Jerusalem, and 
also in the tradition of their fathers, 
which were correct, who believed 
in the commandments of God and 
kept them, were b called the Neph-
ites, or the people of Nephi, from 
that time forth—

12 And it is they who have kept 
the records which are a true of their 
people,  and  also  of  the  people  of 
the Lamanites.

13 Now  we  will  return  again  to 
the Amlicites, for they also had a 
a mark set upon them; yea, they set 
the  mark  upon  themselves,  yea, 
even  a  mark  of  red  upon  their  
foreheads.

14 Thus  the  word  of  God  is  ful-
filled, for these are the words which 
he  said  to  Nephi:  Behold,  the  La-
manites  have  I  cursed,  and  I  will 
set a mark on them that they and 
their seed may be a separated from 
thee and thy seed, from this time 
henceforth and forever, except they 
repent  of  their  wickedness  and 
b turn to me that I may have mercy  
upon them.

15 And  again:  I  will  set  a  mark 
upon  him  that  mingleth  his  seed 
with thy brethren, that they may 
be cursed also.

16 And  again:  I  will  set  a  mark 
upon him that fighteth against thee 
and thy seed.

17 And  again,  I  say  he  that  de-
parteth  from  thee  shall  no  more 
be called thy seed; and I will bless 
thee,  and  whomsoever  shall  be 
called  thy  seed,  henceforth  and 
forever; and these were the prom-
ises of the Lord unto Nephi and to  
his seed.

18 Now  the  Amlicites  knew  not 
that they were fulfilling the words 
of God when they began to mark 
themselves in their foreheads; nev-
ertheless they had come out in open 
a rebellion against God; therefore it 
was expedient that the curse should 
fall upon them.

19 Now  I  would  that  ye  should 
see that they brought upon them-
selves the a curse; and even so doth 
every  man  that  is  cursed  bring

upon  himself  his  own  condem-
nation.

20 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days after the battle which 
was  fought  in  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla,  by  the  Lamanites  and  the  
Amlicites,  that  there  was  another 
army  of  the  Lamanites  came  in 
upon  the  people  of  Nephi,  in  the 
a same  place  where  the  first  army 
met the Amlicites.

21 And it came to pass that there 
was an army sent to drive them out 
of their land.

22 Now  Alma  himself  being  af-
flicted  with  a  a wound  did  not  go 
up to battle at this time against the 
Lamanites;

23 But he sent up a numerous army 
against them; and they went up and 
slew  many  of  the  Lamanites,  and 
drove the remainder of them out of 
the borders of their land.

24 And then they returned again 
and began to establish peace in the 
land, being troubled no more for a 
time with their enemies.

25 Now all these things were done, 
yea, all these wars and contentions 
were  commenced  and  ended  in 
the  fifth  year  of  the  reign  of  the  
judges.

26 And  in  one  year  were  thou-
sands and tens of thousands of souls 
sent to the eternal world, that they 
might reap their a rewards according 
to their works, whether they were 
good or whether they were bad, to 
reap eternal happiness or eternal 
misery, according to the spirit which 
they listed to obey, whether it be a 
good spirit or a bad one.

27 For every man receiveth a wages 
of him whom he listeth to b obey, and 
this according to the words of the 
spirit of prophecy; therefore let it 
be according to the truth. And thus 

endeth the fifth year of the reign 
of the judges.

CHAPTER 4

Alma  baptizes  thousands  of  con-
verts—Iniquity  enters  the  Church, 
and the Church’s progress is hindered—
Nephihah  is  appointed  chief  judge—
Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to 
the ministry. About 86– 83 b.c.
Now  it  came  to  pass  in  the  sixth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, there were no 
contentions nor wars in the  a land 
of Zarahemla;

2 But  the  people  were  afflicted, 
yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of 
their brethren, and also for the a loss 
of their flocks and herds, and also 
for the loss of their fields of grain, 
which were trodden under foot and 
destroyed by the Lamanites.

3 And so great were their afflic-
tions that every soul had cause to 
mourn;  and  they  believed  that  it 
was the judgments of God sent upon 
them because of their wickedness 
and their abominations; therefore 
they were a awakened to a remem-
brance of their duty.

4 And they began to establish the 
a church more fully; yea, and many 
were b baptized in the c waters of Si-
don and were joined to the church 
of God; yea, they were baptized by 
the  hand  of  Alma,  who  had  been 
consecrated  the  d high  priest  over 
the  people  of  the  church,  by  the 
hand of his father Alma.

5 And it came to pass in the seventh 
year of the reign of the judges there 
were about three thousand five hun-
dred souls that united themselves to 
the a church of God and were baptized. 
And thus ended the seventh year of 
the reign of the judges over the people

of Nephi; and there was continual 
peace in all that time.

6 And it came to pass in the eighth 
year  of  the  reign  of  the  judges, 
that the people of the church be-
gan to wax proud, because of their 
exceeding  a riches, and their  b fine 
silks, and their fine-twined linen, 
and because of their many flocks 
and herds, and their gold and their 
silver, and all manner of precious 
things,  which  they  had  obtained 
by their c industry; and in all these 
things  were  they  lifted  up  in  the 
pride of their eyes, for they began 
to wear very costly d apparel.

7 Now this was the cause of much 
affliction to Alma, yea, and to many  
of the people whom Alma had con-
secrated to be a teachers, and b priests, 
and  c elders  over  the  church;  yea, 
many of them were sorely grieved 
for the wickedness which they saw 
had begun to be among their people.
8 For  they  saw  and  beheld  with 
great sorrow that the people of the 
church began to be lifted up in the 
pride of their eyes, and to set their 
a hearts upon riches and upon the 
vain things of the world, that they 
began to be scornful, one towards 
another, and they began to persecute 
those that did b not believe accord-
ing to their own will and pleasure.
9 And thus, in this eighth year of 
the reign of the judges, there began 
to be great a contentions among the 
people of the church; yea, there were 
b envyings, and c strife, and malice, 
and persecutions, and pride, even 
to  exceed  the  pride  of  those  who 
did not belong to the church of God.
10 And  thus  ended  the  eighth 

year of the reign of the judges; and 
the wickedness of the church was 
a  great  a stumbling-block  to  those 
who did not belong to the church; 
and thus the church began to fail 
in its progress.

11 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the ninth year, Alma 
saw the wickedness of the church, 
and he saw also that the a example 
of the church began to lead those 
who were unbelievers on from one 
piece  of  iniquity  to  another,  thus 
bringing on the destruction of the 
people.

12 Yea,  he  saw  great  inequality 
among  the  people,  some  lifting 
themselves up with their pride, de-
spising others, turning their backs 
upon the a needy and the naked and 
those who were b hungry, and those 
who  were  athirst,  and  those  who 
were sick and afflicted.

13 Now this was a great cause for 
lamentations  among  the  people, 
while  others  were  abasing  them-
selves, succoring those who stood in 
need of their succor, such as impart-
ing their substance to the a poor and 
the needy, feeding the hungry, and 
suffering all manner of b afflictions, 
for Christ’s c sake, who should come  
according to the spirit of prophecy;
14 Looking  forward  to  that  day, 
thus  a retaining  a  b remission  of 
their sins; being filled with great 
c joy because of the resurrection of 
the dead, according to the will and 
power  and  d deliverance  of  Jesus 
Christ from the bands of death.

the persecutions which were heaped 
upon them by the remainder of his 
people,  and  seeing  all  their  a in-
equality, began to be very sorrow-
ful;  nevertheless  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord did not fail him.

16 And  he  selected  a  wise  man 
who was among the a elders of the 
church,  and  gave  him  power  ac-
cording to the b voice of the people, 
that he might have power to enact 
c laws according to the laws which 
had been given, and to put them in 
force according to the wickedness 
and the crimes of the people.

17 Now  this  man’s  name  was 
a Nephihah, and he was appointed 
b chief  judge;  and  he  sat  in  the  
judgment-seat to judge and to gov-
ern the people.

18 Now Alma did not grant unto 
him the office of being a high priest 
over the church, but he retained the 
office of high priest unto himself; 
but he delivered the judgment-seat 
unto b Nephihah.

19 And this he did that he a himself 
might go forth among his people, 
or among the people of Nephi, that 
he might b preach the c word of God 
unto them, to d stir them up in e re-
membrance of their duty, and that 
he might pull down, by the word 
of God, all the pride and craftiness 
and all the contentions which were 
among  his  people,  seeing  no  way 
that he might reclaim them save it  
were in bearing down in pure f tes-
timony against them.

20 And thus in the commencement 
of the ninth year of the reign of the 
judges  over  the  people  of  Nephi, 
Alma delivered up the judgment-seat  
to a Nephihah, and confined himself 

wholly to the  b high priesthood of 
the holy order of God, to the c testi-
mony of the word, according to the 
spirit of revelation and prophecy.

The words which Alma, the High 
Priest according to the holy order 
of God, delivered to the people in 
their cities and villages throughout 
the land.

Beginning with chapter 5.

CHAPTER 5

To  gain  salvation,  men  must  repent 
and keep the commandments, be born 
again, cleanse their garments through 
the blood of Christ, be humble and strip 
themselves of pride and envy, and do 
the works of righteousness—The Good 
Shepherd calls His people—Those who 
do evil works are children of the devil—
Alma testifies of the truth of his doctrine 
and  commands  men  to  repent—The 
names of the righteous will be written 
in the book of life. About 83 b.c.
Now it came to pass that Alma be-
gan  to  a deliver  the  word  of  b God 
unto  the  people,  first  in  the  land 
of  Zarahemla,  and  from  thence 
throughout all the land.

2 And these are the words which 
he spake to the people in the church 
which was established in the city 
of Zarahemla, according to his own 
record, saying:

3 I,  Alma,  having  been  a conse-
crated by my father, Alma, to be a 
b high priest over the church of God, 
he  having  power  and  c authority 
from  God  to  do  these  things,  be-

establish a church in the d land which  
was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the 
land which was called the land of 
Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his 
brethren in the waters of Mormon.
4 And behold, I say unto you, they 
were  a delivered  out  of  the  hands 
of the people of king Noah, by the 
mercy and power of God.

5 And behold, after that, they were 
brought into a bondage by the hands 
of the Lamanites in the wilderness; 
yea,  I  say  unto  you,  they  were  in 
captivity,  and  again  the  Lord  did 
deliver  them  out  of  b bondage  by 
the power of his word; and we were 
brought  into  this  land,  and  here 
we  began  to  establish  the  church 
of God throughout this land also.

6 And now behold, I say unto you, 
my  brethren,  you  that  belong  to 
this church, have you sufficiently 
retained in a remembrance the cap-
tivity of your fathers? Yea, and have 
you sufficiently retained in remem-
brance his mercy and long-suffering 
towards them? And moreover, have 
ye sufficiently retained in remem-
brance that he has b delivered their 
souls from hell?

7 Behold, he changed their hearts; 
yea, he awakened them out of a deep 
sleep,  and  they  awoke  unto  God. 
Behold, they were in the midst of 
darkness; nevertheless, their souls 
were  illuminated  by  the  light  of 
the  everlasting  word;  yea,  they 
were encircled about by the a bands 
of  death,  and  the  b chains  of  hell, 
and an everlasting destruction did  
await them.

8 And  now  I  ask  of  you,  my  
brethren,  were  they  destroyed? 

Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they  
were not.

9 And again I ask, were the bands 
of death broken, and the a chains of 
hell  which  encircled  them  about, 
were they loosed? I say unto you, 
Yea,  they  were  loosed,  and  their 
souls did expand, and they did b sing 
redeeming love. And I say unto you 
that they are saved.

10 And now I ask of you on what 
conditions  are  they  a saved?  Yea, 
what  grounds  had  they  to  hope 
for salvation? What is the cause of 
their being loosed from the bands 
of death, yea, and also the chains 
of hell?

11 Behold,  I  can  tell  you—did 
not my father Alma believe in the 
words which were delivered by the 
a mouth of Abinadi? And was he not 
a holy prophet? Did he not speak 
the  words  of  God,  and  my  father 
Alma believe them?

12 And according to his faith there 
was a mighty  a change wrought in 
his  heart.  Behold  I  say  unto  you 
that this is all true.

13 And  behold,  he  a preached 
the word unto your fathers, and a 
mighty  change  was  also  wrought 
in their hearts, and they humbled 
themselves and put their b trust in 
the true and  c living God. And be-
hold, they were faithful until the 
d end; therefore they were saved.

14 And now behold, I ask of you, 
my  brethren  of  the  church,  have 
ye a spiritually been b born of God? 
Have ye received his image in your 
countenances? Have ye experienced 
this mighty c change in your hearts?

redemption  of  him  who  a created 
you? Do you look forward with an 
eye of faith, and view this mortal 
body  raised  in  immortality,  and 
this  corruption  b raised  in  incor-
ruption,  to  stand  before  God  to 
be c judged according to the deeds 
which have been done in the mortal  
body ?

16 I say unto you, can you imagine 
to yourselves that ye hear the voice 
of the Lord, saying unto you, in that 
day: Come unto me ye a blessed, for 
behold, your works have been the 
works  of  righteousness  upon  the 
face of the earth?

17 Or do ye a imagine to yourselves 
that  ye  can  lie  unto  the  Lord  in 
that day, and b say—Lord, our works 
have  been  righteous  works  upon 
the face of the earth—and that he 
will save you?

18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine 
yourselves brought before the tri-
bunal of God with your souls filled 
with  guilt  and  remorse,  having  a 
remembrance of all your guilt, yea, 
a perfect a remembrance of all your 
wickedness,  yea,  a  remembrance 
that  ye  have  set  at  defiance  the 
commandments of God?

19 I say unto you, can ye look up  
to God at that day with a pure heart  
and  clean  hands?  I  say  unto  you, 
can you look up, having the a image  
of God engraven upon your counte-
nances?

20 I say unto you, can ye think of 
being saved when you have yielded 
yourselves to become  a subjects to 
the devil?

21 I say unto you, ye will know at 
that day that ye cannot be a saved; 

for  there  can  no  man  be  saved 
except  his  b garments  are  washed 
white;  yea,  his  garments  must  be 
c purified  until  they  are  cleansed 
from  all  stain,  through  the  blood 
of  him  of  whom  it  has  been  spo-
ken  by  our  fathers,  who  should 
come  to  redeem  his  people  from  
their sins.

22 And now I ask of you, my breth-
ren, how will any of you feel, if ye 
shall stand before the bar of God, 
having your garments stained with 
a blood and all manner of  b filthiness? 
Behold, what will these things tes-
tify against you?

23 Behold  will  they  not  a testify  
that ye are murderers, yea, and also 
that ye are b guilty of all manner of 
wickedness?

24 Behold,  my  brethren,  do  ye 
suppose that such an one can have 
a  place  to  sit  down  in  the  king-
dom of God, with a Abraham, with 
Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all 
the holy prophets, whose garments 
are cleansed and are spotless, pure 
and white?

25 I say unto you, Nay; except ye 
make  our  Creator  a  liar  from  the 
beginning, or suppose that he is a 
liar from the beginning, ye cannot 
suppose that such can have place 
in  the  kingdom  of  heaven;  but 
they shall be cast out for they are 
the  a children  of  the  kingdom  of  
the devil.

26 And now behold, I say unto you, 
my brethren, if ye have experienced 
a a change of heart, and if ye have 
felt  to  sing  the  b song  of  redeem-
ing love, I would ask,  c can ye feel  
so now?

27 Have ye walked, keeping your-
selves a blameless before God? Could 
ye say, if ye were called to die at this 
time, within yourselves, that ye have 
been  sufficiently  b humble?  That 
your garments have been c cleansed 
and made white through the blood 
of Christ, who will come to d redeem 
his people from their sins?

28 Behold, are ye stripped of  a pride? 
I say unto you, if ye are not ye are 
not prepared to meet God. Behold ye 
must prepare quickly; for the king-
dom of heaven is soon at hand, and 
such an one hath not eternal life.

29 Behold, I say, is there one among  
you who is not stripped of a envy ? I 
say unto you that such an one is not 
prepared; and I would that he should 
prepare  b quickly,  for  the  hour  is 
close at hand, and he knoweth not 
when the time shall come; for such 
an one is not found guiltless.

30 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  is 
there  one  among  you  that  doth 
make a a mock of his brother, or that 
heapeth upon him persecutions?

31 Wo  unto  such  an  one,  for  he 
is  not  prepared,  and  the  a time  is 
at hand that he must repent or he 
cannot be saved!

32 Yea, even wo unto all ye a work-
ers of iniquity; repent, repent, for 
the Lord God hath spoken it!

33 Behold, he sendeth an invita-
tion unto a all men, for the b arms of 
mercy are extended towards them, 
and  he  saith:  Repent,  and  I  will  
receive you.

34 Yea, he saith:  a Come unto me 
and  ye  shall  partake  of  the  b fruit 
of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat 
and  drink  of  the  c bread  and  the 
waters of life d freely;

35 Yea, come unto me and bring 
forth works of righteousness, and 
ye shall not be hewn down and cast 
into the fire—

36 For behold, the time is at hand 
that  whosoever  a bringeth  forth 
not  good  fruit,  or  whosoever  do-
eth not the works of righteousness, 
the  same  have  cause  to  wail  and  
mourn.

37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that 
are a puffed up in the vain things of 
the world, ye that have professed 
to  have  known  the  ways  of  righ-
teousness  nevertheless  have  gone 
b astray, as c sheep having no d shep-
herd, notwithstanding a shepherd 
hath  e called  after  you  and  is  still 
calling  after  you,  but  ye  will  not 
f  hearken unto his voice!

38 Behold, I say unto you, that the 
good a shepherd doth call you; yea, 
and in his own name he doth call 
you, which is the name of Christ; 
and  if  ye  will  not  b hearken  unto 
the voice of the c good shepherd, to 
the d name by which ye are called, 
behold, ye are not the sheep of the 
good shepherd.

39 And now if ye are not the a sheep 
of the good shepherd, of what fold 
are  ye?  Behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
that  the  b devil  is  your  shepherd, 
and  ye  are  of  his  fold;  and  now,

who  can  deny  this?  Behold,  I  say 
unto you, whosoever denieth this 
is a c liar and a d child of the devil.
40 For I say unto you that what-
soever is  a good cometh from God, 
and  whatsoever  is  b evil  cometh 
from the devil.

41 Therefore,  if  a  man  bringeth 
forth  a good  works  he  hearkeneth 
unto the voice of the good shepherd, 
and he doth follow him; but who-
soever  bringeth  forth  evil  works, 
the same becometh a b child of the 
devil,  for  he  hearkeneth  unto  his 
voice, and doth follow him.

42 And whosoever doeth this must 
receive  his  a wages  of  him;  there-
fore,  for  his  b wages  he  receiveth 
c death, as to things pertaining unto 
righteousness, being dead unto all 
good works.

43 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should hear me, for I speak 
in the a energy of my soul; for behold,  
I have spoken unto you plainly that 
ye cannot err, or have spoken accord-
ing to the commandments of God.
44 For I am called to speak after 
this manner, according to the a holy 
order  of  God,  which  is  in  Christ 
Jesus;  yea,  I  am  commanded  to 
stand and testify unto this people 
the  things  which  have  been  spo-
ken by our fathers concerning the 
things which are to come.

45 And this is not all. Do ye not 
suppose that I a know of these things 
myself? Behold, I testify unto you 
that  I  do  know  that  these  things 
whereof I have spoken are true. And 
how do ye suppose that I know of 
their surety ?

46 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  they 
are made  a known unto me by the 

Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have 
b fasted and prayed many days that 
I might know these things of my-
self. And now I do know of myself 
that they are true; for the Lord God 
hath made them manifest unto me 
by his Holy Spirit; and this is the 
spirit of c revelation which is in me.
47 And moreover, I say unto you 
that it has thus been revealed unto 
me, that the words which have been 
spoken by our fathers are true, even 
so according to the spirit of proph-
ecy which is in me, which is also 
by the manifestation of the Spirit  
of God.

48 I say unto you, that I know of 
myself that whatsoever I shall say 
unto  you,  concerning  that  which 
is to come, is true; and I say unto 
you, that I know that Jesus Christ 
shall come, yea, the Son, the Only 
Begotten of the Father, full of grace, 
and mercy, and truth. And behold, 
it is he that cometh to take away 
the sins of the world, yea, the sins 
of every man who steadfastly be-
lieveth on his name.

49 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
this is the a order after which I am 
called, yea, to preach unto my be-
loved brethren, yea, and every one 
that  dwelleth  in  the  land;  yea,  to 
preach unto all, both old and young, 
both bond and free; yea, I say unto 
you the aged, and also the middle 
aged, and the rising generation; yea, 
to  cry  unto  them  that  they  must 
repent and be b born again.

50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent,  
all  ye  ends  of  the  earth,  for  the 
kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; 
yea, the Son of God cometh in his 
a glory, in his might, majesty, power,

and  dominion.  Yea,  my  beloved 
brethren, I say unto you, that the 
Spirit  saith:  Behold  the  glory  of  
the  b King  of  all  the  earth;  and  
also the King of heaven shall very 
soon shine forth among all the chil-
dren of men.

51 And also the Spirit saith unto 
me,  yea,  crieth  unto  me  with  a 
mighty voice, saying: Go forth and 
say unto this people—Repent, for 
except ye repent ye can in nowise 
inherit the a kingdom of b heaven.

52 And  again  I  say  unto  you, 
the Spirit saith: Behold, the a ax is  
laid at the root of the tree; there-
fore  every  tree  that  bringeth  not 
forth  good  fruit  shall  be  b hewn 
down  and  cast  into  the  fire,  yea, 
a fire which cannot be consumed, 
even an unquenchable fire. Behold, 
and remember, the Holy One hath 
spoken it.

53 And now my beloved brethren, 
I  say  unto  you,  can  ye  withstand 
these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside 
these things, and a trample the Holy 
One under your feet; yea, can ye be 
b puffed up in the pride of your hearts;  
yea, will ye still persist in the wear-
ing  of  c costly  apparel  and  setting 
your  hearts  upon  the  vain  things 
of the world, upon your d riches?

54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing 
that ye are better one than another; 
yea, will ye persist in the persecu-
tion of your brethren, who humble 
themselves and do walk after the 
holy order of God, wherewith they 
have been brought into this church, 
having been a sanctified by the Holy 
Spirit, and they do bring forth works 
which are meet for repentance—

55 Yea,  and  will  you  persist  in 
turning your backs upon the a poor, 
and the needy, and in withholding 
your substance from them?

56 And finally, all ye that will per-
sist in your wickedness, I say unto 
you that these are they who shall 
be  hewn  down  and  cast  into  the 
fire except they speedily repent.

57 And  now  I  say  unto  you,  all 
you that are desirous to follow the

ye  out  from  the  wicked,  and  be 
ye  b separate,  and  touch  not  their 
unclean things; and behold, their 
names  shall  be  c blotted  out,  that 
the names of the wicked shall not 
be  numbered  among  the  names 
of the righteous, that the word of 
God may be fulfilled, which saith: 
The  names  of  the  wicked  shall 
not be mingled with the names of  
my people;

58 For the names of the righteous 
shall be written in the a book of life, 
and unto them will I grant an inheri-
tance at my right hand. And now, 
my brethren, what have ye to say 
against this? I say unto you, if ye 
speak against it, it matters not, for 
the word of God must be fulfilled.
59 For  what  shepherd  is  there 
among  you  having  many  sheep 
doth not watch over them, that the 
wolves  enter  not  and  devour  his 
flock? And behold, if a wolf enter 
his  a flock  doth  he  not  drive  him 
out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, 
he will destroy him.

60 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
the good shepherd doth call after 
you; and if you will hearken unto 
his voice he will bring you into his

fold, and ye are his sheep; and he 
commandeth you that ye suffer no 
ravenous wolf to enter among you, 
that ye may not be destroyed.

61 And now I, Alma, do command 
you  in  the  language  of  a him  who 
hath  commanded  me,  that  ye  ob-
serve to do the words which I have 
spoken unto you.

62 I  speak  by  way  of  command 
unto you that belong to the church; 
and unto those who do not belong 
to  the  church  I  speak  by  way  of 
invitation,  saying:  Come  and  be 
baptized unto repentance, that ye 
also may be partakers of the fruit 
of the a tree of life.

CHAPTER 6
The Church in Zarahemla is cleansed 
and set in order—Alma goes to Gideon 
to preach. About 83 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
Alma had made an end of speak-
ing unto the people of the church, 
which was established in the city of  
Zarahemla,  he  a ordained  b priests 
and elders, by laying on his c hands 
according  to  the  order  of  God,  to 
preside and d watch over the church.
2 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church 
who  a repented  of  their  sins  were 
baptized unto repentance, and were 
received into the church.

3 And  it  also  came  to  pass  that 
whosoever did belong to the church 
that did not a repent of their wick-
edness  and  humble  themselves  
before  God—I  mean  those  who  
were lifted up in the b pride of their  
hearts—the  same  were  rejected,  
and their names were c blotted out, 
that their names were not numbered 
among those of the righteous.

4 And thus they began to establish 

the order of the church in the a city 
of Zarahemla.

5 Now I would that ye should un-
derstand that the word of God was 
liberal  unto  all,  that  none  were 
deprived of the privilege of assem-
bling themselves together to hear 
the word of God.

6 Nevertheless the children of God 
were commanded that they should 
gather themselves together oft, and 
join in a fasting and mighty prayer 
in behalf of the welfare of the souls 
of those who knew not God.

7 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Alma had made these regu-
lations he departed from them, yea, 
from the church which was in the 
city  of  Zarahemla,  and  went  over 
upon the east of the a river Sidon, into 
the b valley of Gideon, there having 
been a city built, which was called 
the  city  of  Gideon,  which  was  in  
the valley that was called Gideon, 
being called after the man who was 
c slain  by  the  hand  of  Nehor  with 
the sword.

8 And  Alma  went  and  began  to 
declare the word of God unto the 
church  which  was  established  in  
the valley of Gideon, according to 
the  revelation  of  the  truth  of  the 
word  which  had  been  spoken  by 
his  fathers,  and  according  to  the 
spirit  of  prophecy  which  was  in 
him, according to the a testimony of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who 
should come to redeem his people 
from their sins, and the holy order 
by which he was called. And thus 
it is written. Amen.

The  words  of  Alma  which  he  
delivered to the people in Gideon, 
according to his own record.

CHAPTER 7

Christ will be born of Mary—He will 
loose the bands of death and bear the 
sins of His people—Those who repent, 
are baptized, and keep the command-
ments will have eternal life—Filthiness 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God—
Humility, faith, hope, and charity are 
required. About 83 b.c.
Behold my beloved brethren, see-
ing that I have been permitted to 
come unto you, therefore I attempt 
to address you in my language; yea, 
by my  a own mouth, seeing that it 
is  the  first  time  that  I  have  spo-
ken unto you by the words of my 
mouth, I having been wholly con-
fined to the b judgment-seat, having 
had much business that I could not 
come unto you.

2 And even I could not have come 
now  at  this  time  were  it  not  that 
the judgment-seat hath been a given 
to  another,  to  reign  in  my  stead; 
and the Lord in much mercy hath 
granted that I should come unto you.
3 And behold, I have come having 
great hopes and much desire that 
I should find that ye had humbled 
yourselves before God, and that ye 
had continued in the supplicating 
of his grace, that I should find that 
ye were blameless before him, that I 
should find that ye were not in the 
awful a dilemma that our brethren 
were in at Zarahemla.

4 But blessed be the name of God, 
that he hath given me to know, yea, 
hath given unto me the exceedingly 
great joy of knowing that they are 
established again in the way of his 
righteousness.

5 And  I  trust,  according  to  the 
Spirit of God which is in me, that I 
shall also have joy over you; never-
theless I do not desire that my joy 
over you should come by the cause 

of so much afflictions and sorrow 
which I have had for the brethren 
at  Zarahemla,  for  behold,  my  joy 
cometh  over  them  after  wading 
through much affliction and sorrow.
6 But  behold,  I  trust  that  ye  are 
not in a state of so much unbelief 
as were your brethren; I trust that 
ye  are  not  lifted  up  in  the  pride 
of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye 
have not set your hearts upon riches 
and the vain things of the world; 
yea, I trust that you do not worship 
a idols, but that ye do worship the 
true and the b living God, and that 
ye look forward for the remission 
of  your  sins,  with  an  everlasting 
faith, which is to come.

7 For behold, I say unto you there 
be  many  things  to  come;  and  be-
hold,  there  is  one  thing  which  is 
of more importance than they all—
for behold, the a time is not far dis-
tant that the Redeemer liveth and 
cometh among his people.

8 Behold, I do not say that he will 
come among us at the a time of his 
dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; 
for behold, the Spirit hath not said 
unto  me  that  this  should  be  the 
case. Now as to this thing I do not 
know;  but  this  much  I  do  know, 
that the Lord God hath power to do 
all  things  which  are  according  to  
his word.

9 But behold, the Spirit hath said 
this much unto me, saying: Cry unto 
this  people,  saying—a Repent  ye, 
and prepare the way of the Lord, 
and  walk  in  his  paths,  which  are 
straight;  for  behold,  the  kingdom 
of heaven is at hand, and the Son 
of  God  b cometh  upon  the  face  of 
the earth.

10 And behold, he shall be a born 
of Mary, at b Jerusalem which is the 
c land of our forefathers, she being 
a  d virgin,  a  precious  and  chosen

vessel, who shall be overshadowed 
and e conceive by the power of the 
Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, 
yea, even the Son of God.

11 And he shall go forth, suffering 
pains and a afflictions and b tempta-
tions of every kind; and this that the 
word might be fulfilled which saith 
he  will  c take  upon  him  the  pains 
and the sicknesses of his people.

12 And  he  will  take  upon  him 
a death, that he may b loose the bands 
of  death  which  bind  his  people; 
and  he  will  take  upon  him  their 
infirmities, that his bowels may be 
filled with mercy, according to the 
flesh, that he may know according 
to the flesh how to c succor his peo-
ple according to their infirmities.
13 Now  the  Spirit  a knoweth  all 
things; nevertheless the Son of God 
suffereth according to the b flesh that 
he might c take upon him the sins of 
his people, that he might blot out 
their  transgressions  according  to 
the power of his deliverance; and 
now behold, this is the testimony 
which is in me.

14 Now  I  say  unto  you  that  ye 
must  a repent,  and  be  born  again; 
for  the  Spirit  saith  if  ye  are  not 
born  again  ye  cannot  inherit  the 
kingdom of heaven; therefore come 
and be baptized unto repentance, 
that ye may be washed from your 
sins, that ye may have faith on the 
Lamb of God, who taketh away the 
sins  of  the  world,  who  is  mighty 
to save and to cleanse from all un-
righteousness.

15 Yea, I say unto you come and 
fear  not,  and  lay  aside  every  sin, 
which easily doth a beset you, which 
doth bind you down to destruction, 
yea, come and go forth, and show 
unto your God that ye are willing 

to  repent  of  your  sins  and  enter 
into a covenant with him to keep 
his  commandments,  and  witness 
it unto him this day by going into 
the waters of baptism.

16 And  whosoever  doeth  this, 
and  keepeth  the  commandments 
of God from thenceforth, the same 
will a remember that I say unto him, 
yea, he will remember that I have 
said unto him, he shall have eter-
nal life, according to the testimony 
of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth  
in me.

17 And now my beloved brethren,  
do  you  believe  these  things?  Be-
hold,  I  say  unto  you,  yea,  I  know 
that ye believe them; and the way 
that I know that ye believe them is 
by the manifestation of the Spirit 
which is in me. And now because 
your faith is strong concerning that, 
yea, concerning the things which I 
have spoken, great is my joy.

18 For as I said unto you from the 
beginning, that I had much desire 
that ye were not in the state of a di-
lemma like your brethren, even so 
I have found that my desires have 
been gratified.

19 For  I  perceive  that  ye  are  in 
the  paths  of  righteousness;  I  per-
ceive that ye are in the path which 
leads to the kingdom of God; yea, 
I perceive that ye are making his 
a paths straight.

20 I perceive that it has been made 
known unto you, by the testimony 
of his word, that he cannot  a walk 
in crooked paths; neither doth he 
vary from that which he hath said; 
neither hath he a shadow of turning 
from the right to the left, or from 
that which is right to that which is 
wrong; therefore, his course is one 
eternal round.

21 And he doth not dwell in a un-
holy temples; neither can filthiness 
or  anything  which  is  unclean  be 
received into the kingdom of God; 
therefore I say unto you the time 
shall come, yea, and it shall be at 
the last day, that he who is b filthy 
shall remain in his filthiness.

22 And now my beloved brethren, I 
have said these things unto you that 
I might awaken you to a sense of 
your duty to God, that ye may walk 
blameless before him, that ye may 
walk after the holy order of God,  
after which ye have been received.
23 And now I would that ye should 
be a humble, and be b submissive and 
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of 
patience  and  long-suffering;  be-
ing temperate in all things; being 
diligent in keeping the command-
ments  of  God  at  all  times;  asking 
for whatsoever things ye stand in 
need, both spiritual and temporal; 
always returning thanks unto God 
for whatsoever things ye do receive.
24 And  see  that  ye  have  a faith, 
hope, and charity, and then ye will 
always abound in good works.

25 And  may  the  Lord  bless  you, 
and  keep  your  garments  spotless, 
that ye may at last be brought to 
sit down with a Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, and the holy prophets who 
have been ever since the world be-
gan, having your garments b spotless 
even as their garments are spotless, 
in the kingdom of heaven to go no 
more out.

26 And now my beloved brethren, 
I  have  spoken  these  words  unto 
you according to the Spirit which 
testifieth in me; and my soul doth  
exceedingly rejoice, because of the 
exceeding diligence and heed which 
ye have given unto my word.

27 And now, may the a peace of God  

rest upon you, and upon your houses 
and lands, and upon your flocks and 
herds, and all that you possess, your 
women and your children, accord-
ing to your faith and good works, 
from  this  time  forth  and  forever. 
And thus I have spoken. Amen.

CHAPTER 8

Alma  preaches  and  baptizes  in  Me-
lek—He  is  rejected  in  Ammonihah 
and leaves—An angel commands him 
to return and cry repentance unto the 
people—He is received by Amulek, and 
the two of them preach in Ammonihah. 
About 82 b.c.
And now it came to pass that Alma 
returned from the a land of Gideon, 
after having taught the people of 
Gideon many things which cannot 
be written, having established the 
b order of the church, according as 
he had before done in the land of 
Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his 
own  house  at  Zarahemla  to  rest 
himself from the labors which he 
had performed.

2 And thus ended the ninth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

3 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the tenth year of the 
reign of the judges over the people 
of Nephi, that Alma departed from 
thence  and  took  his  journey  over 
into the land of a Melek, on the west 
of the b river Sidon, on the west by 
the borders of the wilderness.

4 And he began to teach the peo-
ple in the land of Melek according 
to the a holy order of God, by which 
he had been called; and he began 
to teach the people throughout all 
the land of Melek.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the  
people came to him throughout all

the borders of the land which was by 
the wilderness side. And they were 
baptized throughout all the land;

6 So that when he had finished his 
work at Melek he departed thence, 
and traveled three days’ journey on 
the north of the land of Melek; and 
he came to a city which was called 
a Ammonihah.

7 Now  it  was  the  custom  of  the  
people of Nephi to call their lands, 
and their cities, and their villages, 
yea, even all their small villages, af-
ter the a name of him who first pos-
sessed them; and thus it was with  
the land of Ammonihah.

8 And it came to pass that when 
Alma had come to the city of Am-
monihah  he  began  to  preach  the 
word of God unto them.

9 Now Satan had gotten great a hold 
upon the hearts of the people of the  
city of Ammonihah; therefore they 
would not hearken unto the words 
of Alma.

10 Nevertheless  Alma  a labored 
much in the spirit, b wrestling with 
God  in  c mighty  prayer,  that  he 
would pour out his Spirit upon the 
people who were in the city; that 
he would also grant that he might 
baptize them unto repentance.

11 Nevertheless,  they  hardened 
their hearts, saying unto him: Behold,  
we know that thou art Alma; and we  
know that thou art high priest over 
the church which thou hast estab-
lished  in  many  parts  of  the  land, 
according to your tradition; and we 
are not of thy church, and we do not 
believe in such foolish traditions.

12 And now we know that because  
we are not of thy church we know 
that thou hast no power over us; and  
thou hast delivered up the judgment- 
seat unto a Nephihah; therefore thou 
art not the chief judge over us.

13 Now when the people had said 
this, and withstood all his words, 
and  a reviled  him,  and  spit  upon 
him, and caused that he should be 
b cast out of their city, he departed 
thence and took his journey towards 
the city which was called Aaron.

14 And it came to pass that while 
he  was  journeying  thither,  being 
weighed down with sorrow, wading 
through much a tribulation and an-
guish of soul, because of the wicked-
ness of the people who were in the 
city of Ammonihah, it came to pass 
while Alma was thus weighed down 
with sorrow, behold an b angel of the 
Lord appeared unto him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma; there-
fore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for  
thou  hast  great  cause  to  rejoice;  
for thou hast been faithful in keep-
ing the commandments of God from 
the time which thou receivedst thy 
first message from him. Behold, I 
am he that a delivered it unto you.
16 And behold, I am sent to a com-
mand thee that thou return to the 
city  of  Ammonihah,  and  preach 
again unto the people of the city; 
yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto 
them, except they repent the Lord 
God will b destroy them.

17 For  behold,  they  do  study  at 
this  time  that  they  may  destroy 
the liberty of thy people, (for thus 
saith the Lord) which is contrary to 
the  a statutes, and judgments, and 
commandments which he has given  
unto his people.

18 Now it came to pass that after 
Alma had received his message from 
the angel of the Lord he returned 
speedily to the land of Ammonihah. 
And he entered the city by another 
way, yea, by the way which is on 
the south of the city of Ammonihah.
19 And as a he entered the city he

was  an  hungered,  and  he  said  to 
a man: Will ye give to an humble 
servant of God something to eat?

20 And the man said unto him: I 
am a Nephite, and I know that thou 
art a holy prophet of God, for thou 
art the man whom an a angel said in 
a vision: Thou shalt receive. There-
fore,  go  with  me  into  my  house 
and I will impart unto thee of my 
b food; and I know that thou wilt be 
a blessing unto me and my house.
21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
man received him into his house; 
and  the  man  was  called  Amulek; 
and  he  brought  forth  bread  and 
meat and set before Alma.

22 And it came to pass that Alma 
ate  bread  and  was  filled;  and  he 
a blessed Amulek and his house, and 
he gave thanks unto God.

23 And  after  he  had  eaten  and 
was filled he said unto Amulek: I 
am Alma, and am the a high priest 
over the church of God throughout 
the land.

24 And behold, I have been called 
to preach the word of God among all 
this people, according to the spirit 
of revelation and prophecy; and I 
was  in  this  land  and  they  would 
not receive me, but they  a cast me 
out and I was about to set my back 
towards this land forever.

25 But behold, I have been com-
manded that I should turn again and 
prophesy unto this people, yea, and 
to testify against them concerning 
their iniquities.

26 And now, Amulek, because thou 
hast fed me and taken me in, thou 
art blessed; for I was an hungered, 
for I had fasted many days.

27 And Alma a tarried many days 
with  Amulek  before  he  began  to 
preach unto the people.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people did wax more gross in their 
iniquities.

29 And  the  word  came  to  Alma, 

saying: Go; and also say unto my ser-
vant  a Amulek, go forth and prophesy 
unto  this  people,  saying—Repent 
ye, for thus saith the Lord, except 
ye repent I will visit this people in 
mine anger; yea, and I will not turn 
my b fierce anger away.

30 And Alma went forth, and also 
Amulek, among the people, to de-
clare the words of God unto them; 
and they were filled with the Holy 
Ghost.

31 And they had a power given unto 
them,  insomuch  that  they  could 
not be confined in dungeons; nei-
ther was it possible that any man 
could slay them; nevertheless they 
did  not  exercise  their  b power  un-
til they were bound in bands and 
cast into prison. Now, this was done 
that the Lord might show forth his 
power in them.

32 And it came to pass that they 
went  forth  and  began  to  preach 
and to prophesy unto the people, 
according to the spirit and power 
which the Lord had given them.

The  words  of  Alma,  and  also  the 
words of Amulek, which were de-
clared  unto  the  people  who  were 
in  the  land  of  Ammonihah.  And 
also they are cast into prison, and 
delivered by the miraculous power 
of God which was in them, accord-
ing to the record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 9 through 14.

CHAPTER 9

Alma  commands  the  people  of  Am-
monihah to repent—The Lord will be 
merciful to the Lamanites in the last 
days—If the Nephites forsake the light, 
they will be destroyed by the Laman-
ites—The Son of God will come soon—
He will redeem those who repent, are 
baptized, and have faith in His name.

And  again,  I,  Alma,  having  been 
commanded  of  God  that  I  should 
take  Amulek  and  go  forth  and 
preach again unto this people, or 
the people who were in the city of 
a Ammonihah, it came to pass as I 
began  to  preach  unto  them,  they 
began to contend with me, saying:
2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we 
shall believe the testimony of a one 
man,  although  he  should  preach 
unto us that the earth should pass 
away ?

3 Now  they  understood  not  the 
words which they spake; for they 
knew  not  that  the  earth  should 
pass away.

4 And they said also: We will not 
believe thy words if thou shouldst 
prophesy that this great city should 
be destroyed in a one day.

5 Now  they  knew  not  that  God 
could  do  such  marvelous  a works, 
for they were a hard-hearted and 
a stiffnecked people.

6 And they said: a Who is God, that 
sendeth b no more authority than one 
man among this people, to declare 
unto them the truth of such great 
and marvelous things?

7 And they stood forth to lay their 
hands on me; but behold, they did 
not. And I stood with boldness to 
declare unto them, yea, I did boldly 
testify unto them, saying:

8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse 
a generation, how have ye forgotten 
the b tradition of your fathers; yea, 
how  soon  ye  have  forgotten  the 
commandments of God.

9 Do  ye  not  remember  that  our 
father, Lehi, was brought out of Je-
rusalem by the  a hand of God? Do 
ye not remember that they were all 
led by him through the wilderness?
10 And have ye forgotten so soon 

how many times he a delivered our 
fathers  out  of  the  hands  of  their 
enemies, and preserved them from 
being destroyed, even by the hands 
of their own brethren?

11 Yea, and if it had not been for 
his matchless power, and his mercy, 
and his a long-suffering towards us, 
we should unavoidably have been 
cut off from the face of the earth 
long before this period of time, and 
perhaps been consigned to a state 
of b endless misery and woe.

12 Behold, now I say unto you that 
he commandeth you to repent; and 
except ye repent, ye can in nowise 
inherit  the  kingdom  of  God.  But 
behold, this is not all—he has com-
manded you to repent, or he will 
utterly  a destroy  you  from  off  the 
face of the earth; yea, he will visit 
you in his b anger, and in his c fierce 
anger he will not turn away.

13 Behold, do ye not remember the 
words which he spake unto Lehi, say-
ing that: a Inasmuch as ye shall keep  
my commandments, ye shall pros-
per in the land? And again it is said 
that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep 
my commandments ye shall be cut 
off from the presence of the Lord.
14 Now  I  would  that  ye  should 
remember,  that  inasmuch  as  the 
Lamanites have not kept the com-
mandments of God, they have been 
a cut  off  from  the  presence  of  the 
Lord. Now we see that the word of 
the Lord has been verified in this 
thing, and the Lamanites have been 
cut off from his presence, from the 
beginning  of  their  transgressions 
in the land.

15 Nevertheless  I  say  unto  you, 
that it shall be more a tolerable for 
them in the day of judgment than 
for you, if ye remain in your sins,

yea,  and  even  more  tolerable  for 
them in this life than for you, ex-
cept ye repent.

16 For  there  are  many  promises 
which are a extended to the Laman-
ites; for it is because of the b tradi-
tions  of  their  fathers  that  caused 
them  to  remain  in  their  state  of 
c ignorance; therefore the Lord will 
be merciful unto them and d prolong 
their existence in the land.

17 And  at  some  period  of  time 
they will be a brought to believe in 
his word, and to know of the incor-
rectness of the traditions of their 
fathers; and many of them will be 
saved, for the Lord will be merci-
ful unto all who b call on his name.
18 But behold, I say unto you that 
if ye persist in your wickedness that 
your days shall not be a prolonged 
in the land, for the b Lamanites shall 
be sent upon you; and if ye repent 
not they shall come in a time when 
you know not, and ye shall be vis-
ited  with  c utter  destruction;  and 
it shall be according to the fierce 
d anger of the Lord.

19 For he will not suffer you that 
ye  shall  live  in  your  iniquities, 
to  a destroy  his  people.  I  say  unto 
you,  Nay;  he  would  rather  suffer 
that the Lamanites might destroy 
all  his  people  who  are  called  the 
people of Nephi, if it were possible 
that they could b fall into sins and 
transgressions,  after  having  had 
so much light and so much knowl-
edge given unto them of the Lord  
their God;

20 Yea, after having been such a 
highly favored people of the Lord; 
yea,  after  having  been  favored 
above every other a nation, kindred, 

tongue, or people; after having had 
all things b made known unto them, 
according to their desires, and their 
faith, and prayers, of that which has 
been,  and  which  is,  and  which  is  
to come;

21 Having  been  a visited  by  the 
Spirit  of  God;  having  conversed 
with angels, and having been spo-
ken unto by the voice of the Lord; 
and having the spirit of prophecy, 
and the spirit of revelation, and also 
many gifts, the gift of speaking with 
tongues, and the gift of preaching, 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
the gift of b translation;

22 Yea,  and  after  having  been  
a delivered of God out of the land 
of  Jerusalem,  by  the  hand  of  the 
Lord;  having  been  b saved  from 
famine, and from sickness, and all 
manner of diseases of every kind; 
and  they  having  waxed  strong  in 
battle, that they might not be de-
stroyed; having been brought out of 
c bondage time after time, and hav-
ing been kept and preserved until 
now; and they have been prospered 
until they are rich in all manner of  
things—

23 And now behold I say unto you, 
that  if  this  people,  who  have  re-
ceived so many blessings from the 
hand of the Lord, should transgress 
a contrary  to  the  light  and  knowl-
edge which they do have, I say unto 
you that if this be the case, that if 
they should fall into transgression, 
it would be far more b tolerable for 
the Lamanites than for them.

24 For behold, the a promises of the 
Lord are extended to the Lamanites, 
but they are not unto you if ye trans-
gress; for has not the Lord expressly

promised and firmly decreed, that 
if ye will rebel against him that ye 
shall b utterly be destroyed from off 
the face of the earth?

25 And now for this cause, that ye 
may not be destroyed, the Lord has 
sent his angel to visit many of his 
people,  declaring  unto  them  that 
they must go forth and cry mightily 
unto  this  people,  saying:  a Repent 
ye,  for  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is 
nigh at hand;

26 And a not many days hence the 
Son of God shall come in his b glory; 
and his glory shall be the glory of 
the  Only  Begotten  of  the  Father, 
full  of  c grace,  equity,  and  truth, 
full of patience, d mercy, and long-
suffering, quick to  e hear the cries 
of his people and to answer their  
prayers.

27 And behold, he cometh to a re-
deem those who will be b baptized 
unto repentance, through faith on 
his name.

28 Therefore, prepare ye the way 
of the Lord, for the time is at hand 
that all men shall reap a  a reward 
of their  b works, according to that 
which they have been—if they have 
been righteous they shall c reap the 
salvation of their souls, according to 
the power and deliverance of Jesus 
Christ; and if they have been evil 
they shall reap the d damnation of 
their souls, according to the power 
and captivation of the devil.

29 Now behold, this is the voice of 
the angel, crying unto the people.
30 And  now,  my  a beloved  breth-
ren, for ye are my brethren, and ye 
ought to be beloved, and ye ought 
to bring forth works which are meet 
for  repentance,  seeing  that  your 
hearts have been grossly hardened 
against the word of God, and see-

ing that ye are a b lost and a fallen  
people.

31 Now it came to pass that when 
I,  Alma,  had  spoken  these  words, 
behold,  the  people  were  wroth 
with me because I said unto them 
that they were a hard-hearted and 
a a stiffnecked people.

32 And  also  because  I  said  unto 
them  that  they  were  a  lost  and  a 
fallen people they were angry with 
me, and sought to lay their hands 
upon me, that they might cast me 
into prison.

33 But  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did not suffer them that they 
should  take  me  a at  that  time  and 
cast me into prison.

34 And it came to pass that Amu-
lek went and stood forth, and be-
gan to preach unto them also. And 
now the a words of Amulek are not 
all written, nevertheless a part of 
his words are written in this book.

CHAPTER 10

Lehi descended from Manasseh—Amu-
lek recounts the angelic command that 
he care for Alma—The prayers of the 
righteous cause the people to be spared—
Unrighteous lawyers and judges lay the 
foundation  of  the  destruction  of  the 
people. About 82 b.c.
Now  these  are  the  a words  which 
b Amulek preached unto the people 
who were in the land of Ammoni-
hah, saying:

2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Gid-
donah, who was the son of Ishmael, 
who was a descendant of Aminadi; 
and it was that same Aminadi who 
interpreted  the  a writing  which 
was  upon  the  wall  of  the  temple, 
which  was  written  by  the  finger  
of God.

3 And Aminadi was a descendant 
of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, 
who came out of the land of Jeru-
salem,  who  was  a  descendant  of  
a Manasseh,  who  was  the  son  of  
b Joseph who was  c sold into Egypt 
by the hands of his brethren.

4 And behold, I am also a man of 
no small a reputation among all those 
who know me; yea, and behold, I 
have many kindreds and b friends, 
and I have also acquired much riches 
by the hand of my c industry.

5 Nevertheless,  after  all  this,  I 
never  have  known  much  of  the 
ways of the Lord, and his a mysteries  
and marvelous power. I said I never 
had known much of these things; 
but  behold,  I  mistake,  for  I  have 
seen much of his mysteries and his  
marvelous power; yea, even in the 
preservation  of  the  lives  of  this 
people.

6 Nevertheless,  I  did  harden  my 
heart, for I was a called many times 
and I would not b hear; therefore I 
knew concerning these things, yet  
I would not know; therefore I went 
on  rebelling  c against  God,  in  the 
wickedness of my heart, even un-
til  the  fourth  day  of  this  seventh 
month, which is in the tenth year 
of the reign of the judges.

7 As I was journeying to see a very 
near kindred, behold an a angel of  
the  Lord  appeared  unto  me  and 
said: Amulek, return to thine own 
house, for thou shalt feed a prophet 
of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is  
a  chosen  man  of  God;  for  he  has 
b fasted many days because of the  
sins of this people, and he is an hun-
gered, and thou shalt c receive him 
into thy house and feed him, and 
he shall bless thee and thy house;  

and the blessing of the Lord shall 
rest upon thee and thy house.

8 And it came to pass that I obeyed 
the voice of the angel, and returned 
towards my house. And as I was go-
ing thither I found the a man whom 
the angel said unto me: Thou shalt 
receive into thy house—and behold 
it was this same man who has been 
speaking unto you concerning the 
things of God.

9 And the angel said unto me he is 
a a holy man; wherefore I know he 
is a holy man because it was said 
by an angel of God.

10 And  again,  I  know  that  the 
things  whereof  he  hath  testified  
are true; for behold I say unto you, 
that as the Lord liveth, even so has he 
sent his a angel to make these things 
manifest unto me; and this he has 
done while this Alma hath b dwelt  
at my house.

11 For  behold,  he  hath  a blessed 
mine  house,  he  hath  blessed  me, 
and my women, and my children, 
and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, 
even all my kindred hath he blessed, 
and the blessing of the Lord hath 
rested  upon  us  according  to  the  
words which he spake.

12 And  now,  when  Amulek  had 
spoken these words the people be-
gan to be astonished, seeing there 
was  a more  than  one  witness  who 
testified of the things whereof they 
were accused, and also of the things 
which were to come, according to 
the  spirit  of  prophecy  which  was 
in them.

13 Nevertheless, there were some 
among them who thought to ques-
tion  them,  that  by  their  cunning 
a devices they might catch them in 
their words, that they might b find

witness  against  them,  that  they 
might deliver them to their judges 
that they might be judged accord-
ing to the law, and that they might 
be slain or cast into prison, accord-
ing to the crime which they could 
make  appear  or  witness  against  
them.

14 Now  it  was  those  men  who 
sought to destroy them, who were 
a lawyers,  who  were  hired  or  ap-
pointed by the people to adminis-
ter the law at their times of trials, 
or at the trials of the crimes of the 
people before the judges.

15 Now these lawyers were learned 
in all the arts and a cunning of the 
people; and this was to enable them 
that they might be skilful in their 
profession.

16 And it came to pass that they 
began  to  question  Amulek,  that 
thereby they might make him a cross 
his words, or contradict the words 
which he should speak.

17 Now they knew not that Amu-
lek  could  a know  of  their  designs. 
But it came to pass as they began 
to question him, he b perceived their 
thoughts, and he said unto them: O 
ye wicked and perverse c generation, 
ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye 
are  laying  the  foundations  of  the 
devil; for ye are laying d traps and 
snares to catch the holy ones of God.
18 Ye are laying plans to a pervert 
the  ways  of  the  righteous,  and  to 
bring down the wrath of God upon 
your  heads,  even  to  the  utter  de-
struction of this people.

19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who 
was our last king, when he was about 
to deliver up the kingdom, having 
no one to confer it upon, causing 
that this people should be governed 

by their own voices—yea, well did 
he say that if the time should come 
that the voice of this people should 
a choose iniquity, that is, if the time 
should come that this people should 
fall into transgression, they would 
be ripe for destruction.

20 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
well doth the Lord a judge of your 
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this 
people, by the voice of his b angels: 
Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom 
of heaven is at hand.

21 Yea,  well  doth  he  cry,  by  the 
voice of his angels that: a I will come 
down among my people, with equity 
and justice in my hands.

22 Yea, and I say unto you that if 
it were not for the a prayers of the 
righteous, who are now in the land, 
that ye would even now be visited 
with utter destruction; yet it would 
not be by b flood, as were the people 
in the days of c Noah, but it would 
be  by  famine,  and  by  pestilence, 
and the d sword.

23 But it is by the a prayers of the 
righteous that ye are spared; now 
therefore,  if  ye  will  b cast  out  the 
righteous from among you then will 
not the Lord stay his hand; but in 
his fierce anger he will come out 
against you; then ye shall be smit-
ten by famine, and by pestilence, 
and by the sword; and the c time is 
soon at hand except ye repent.

24 And now it came to pass that 
the people were more angry with 
Amulek, and they cried out, saying: 
This  man  doth  revile  against  our 
laws which are just, and our wise 
a lawyers whom we have selected.

25 But  Amulek  stretched  forth 
his  hand,  and  cried  the  mightier 
unto them, saying: O ye wicked and

perverse generation, why hath Sa-
tan got such great hold upon your 
hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves 
unto him that he may have power 
over you, to a blind your eyes, that 
ye will not understand the words 
which  are  spoken,  according  to  
their truth?

26 For  behold,  have  I  testified 
against  your  law?  Ye  do  not  un-
derstand; ye say that I have spoken 
against  your  law;  but  I  have  not, 
but I have spoken in favor of your 
law, to your condemnation.

27 And now behold, I say unto you, 
that the foundation of the a destruc-
tion of this people is beginning to 
be laid by the b unrighteousness of 
your c lawyers and your judges.

28 And now it came to pass that 
when  Amulek  had  spoken  these 
words the people cried out against 
him, saying: Now we know that this 
man is a a child of the devil, for he 
hath b lied unto us; for he hath spo-
ken against our law. And now he says  
that he has not spoken against it.

29 And  again,  he  has  reviled 
against our lawyers, and our judges.
30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
lawyers put it into their hearts that 
they should remember these things 
against him.

31 And there was one among them 
whose name was Zeezrom. Now he 
was the foremost to a accuse Amu-
lek and Alma, he being one of the 
most  expert  among  them,  having 
much  business  to  do  among  the  
people.

32 Now the object of these lawyers 
was to get gain; and they got gain 
a according to their employ.

CHAPTER 11
The  Nephite  monetary  system  is  set 
forth—Amulek  contends  with  Zeez-

rom—Christ will not save people in their 
sins—Only those who inherit the king-
dom of heaven are saved—All men will 
rise in immortality—There is no death 
after the Resurrection. About 82 b.c.

Now it was in the law of Mosiah that 
every man who was a judge of the 
law, or those who were appointed 
to be judges, should receive a wages 
b according to the time which they 
labored  to  judge  those  who  were 
brought before them to be judged.
2 Now if a man owed another, and 
he  would  not  a pay  that  which  he 
did owe, he was complained of to 
the judge; and the judge executed 
authority,  and  sent  forth  officers 
that  the  man  should  be  brought 
before him; and he judged the man 
according to the law and the evi-
dences which were brought against 
him,  and  thus  the  man  was  com-
pelled to pay that which he owed, 
or be stripped, or be cast out from 
among  the  people  as  a  thief  and  
a robber.

3 And the judge received for his 
wages a according to his time—a b se-
nine of gold for a day, or a senum 
of silver, which is equal to a senine 
of gold; and this is according to the 
law which was given.

4 Now these are the names of the 
different pieces of their gold, and 
of  their  silver,  according  to  their 
value. And the names are given by 
the Nephites, for they did not reckon 
after the a manner of the Jews who 
were at Jerusalem; neither did they 
measure  after  the  manner  of  the 
Jews;  but  they  altered  their  reck-
oning and their measure, according 
to the minds and the circumstances 
of the people, in every generation, 
until the reign of the judges, they 
having  been  b established  by  king 
Mosiah.

5 Now the reckoning is thus—a se-
nine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum 
of gold, and a limnah of gold.

6 A senum of silver, an amnor of 
silver,  an  ezrom  of  silver,  and  an 
onti of silver.

7 A  senum  of  silver  was  equal  
to a senine of gold, and either for 
a measure of barley, and also for a  
measure of every kind of grain.

8 Now  the  amount  of  a  seon  of 
gold was twice the value of a senine.
9 And a shum of gold was twice 

the value of a seon.

10 And a limnah of gold was the 

value of them all.

11 And an amnor of silver was as 

great as two senums.

12 And an ezrom of silver was as 

great as four senums.

13 And  an  onti  was  as  great  as 

them all.

14 Now  this  is  the  value  of  the 
lesser numbers of their reckoning—
15 A  shiblon  is  half  of  a  senum; 
therefore, a shiblon for half a mea-
sure of barley.

16 And  a  shiblum  is  a  half  of  a 

shiblon.

shiblum.

17 And  a  leah  is  the  half  of  a 

18 Now this is their number, ac-

cording to their reckoning.

19 Now an antion of gold is equal 

to three shiblons.

20 Now, it was for the sole purpose 
to get a gain, because they received 
their wages according to their b em-
ploy, therefore, they did c stir up the 
people to d riotings, and all manner 
of  disturbances  and  wickedness, 
that  they  might  have  more  em-
ploy, that they might  e get  f money 
according to the suits which were 
brought before them; therefore they 
did stir up the people against Alma 
and Amulek.

21 And  this  Zeezrom  began  to 
question  Amulek,  saying:  Will  ye 
answer me a few questions which I 
shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a 
man who was a expert in the b devices 
of the devil, that he might destroy 
that which was good; therefore, he 
said unto Amulek: Will ye answer 
the  questions  which  I  shall  put  
unto you?

22 And  Amulek  said  unto  him: 
Yea, if it be according to the a Spirit 
of the Lord, which is in me; for I 
shall  say  nothing  which  is  con-
trary to the Spirit of the Lord. And 
Zeezrom  said  unto  him:  Behold, 
here are six onties of silver, and all 
these will I b give thee if thou wilt 
deny  the  existence  of  a  Supreme  
Being.

23 Now Amulek said: O thou a child 
of hell, why b tempt ye me? Knowest 
thou that the righteous yieldeth to 
no such temptations?

24 Believest  thou  that  there  is 
no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou 
knowest that there is a God, but thou 
lovest that a lucre more than him.
25 And  now  thou  hast  lied  be-
fore  God  unto  me.  Thou  saidst 
unto me—Behold these six onties, 
which  are  of  great  worth,  I  will 
give  unto  thee—when  thou  hadst 
it in thy heart to retain them from 
me; and it was only thy desire that 
I should deny the true and living 
God, that thou mightest have cause 
to destroy me. And now behold, for 
this great evil thou shalt have thy  
reward.

26 And  Zeezrom  said  unto  him: 
Thou sayest there is a true and liv-
ing God?

27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is 

a true and living God.

28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more 

than one God?

29 And he answered, No.
30 Now  Zeezrom  said  unto  him 
again:  How  knowest  thou  these 
things?

31 And  he  said:  An  a angel  hath 

made them known unto me.

32 And Zeezrom said again: Who 
is he that shall come? Is it the Son 
of God?

33 And he said unto him, Yea.
34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall 
he  save  his  people  a in  their  sins? 
And  Amulek  answered  and  said 
unto him: I say unto you he shall 
not, for it is impossible for him to 
deny his word.

35 Now  Zeezrom  said  unto  the 
people: See that ye remember these 
things; for he said there is but one 
God;  yet  he  saith  that  the  Son  of 
God shall come, but he shall  a not 
save his people—as though he had 
authority to command God.

36 Now Amulek saith again unto 
him:  Behold  thou  hast  a lied,  for 
thou sayest that I spake as though 
I  had  authority  to  command  God 
because I said he shall not save his 
people in their sins.

37 And I say unto you again that 
he cannot save them in their a sins; 
for I cannot deny his word, and he 
hath  said  that  b no  unclean  thing 
can inherit the c kingdom of heaven; 
therefore,  how  can  ye  be  saved, 
except  ye  inherit  the  kingdom  of 
heaven?  Therefore,  ye  cannot  be 
saved in your sins.

38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto 
him:  Is  the  Son  of  God  the  very 
Eternal Father?

39 And  Amulek  said  unto  him: 
Yea, he is the very a Eternal Father 

of  heaven  and  of  earth,  and  b all 
things which in them are; he is the 
beginning  and  the  end,  the  first 
and the last;

40 And  he  shall  come  into  the 
a world to b redeem his people; and 
he shall c take upon him the trans-
gressions of those who believe on 
his name; and these are they that 
shall  have  eternal  life,  and  salva-
tion cometh to none else.

41 Therefore the wicked remain as 
though there had been a no redemp-
tion made, except it be the loosing 
of the bands of death; for behold, 
the day cometh that b all shall rise 
from  the  dead  and  stand  before 
God, and be  c judged according to 
their works.

42 Now,  there  is  a  death  which 
is  called  a  temporal  death;  and 
the death of Christ shall loose the 
a bands of this temporal death, that 
all shall be raised from this temporal  
death.

43 The spirit and the body shall 
be  a reunited  again  in  its  b perfect 
form; both limb and joint shall be 
restored to its proper frame, even 
as we now are at this time; and we 
shall  be  brought  to  stand  before 
God,  c knowing  even  as  we  know 
now,  and  have  a  bright  d recollec-
tion of all our e guilt.

44 Now,  this  restoration  shall 
come  to  all,  both  old  and  young, 
both bond and free, both male and 
female,  both  the  wicked  and  the 
righteous; and even there shall not 
so much as a hair of their heads be 
lost;  but  every  thing  shall  be  a re-
stored to its perfect frame, as it is 
now,  or  in  the  body,  and  shall  be

brought and be arraigned before the 
bar of Christ the Son, and God the 
b Father, and the Holy Spirit, which 
is c one Eternal God, to be d judged 
according to their works, whether 
they  be  good  or  whether  they  be  
evil.

45 Now,  behold,  I  have  spoken 
unto you concerning the a death of 
the mortal body, and also concern-
ing the b resurrection of the mortal 
body. I say unto you that this mor-
tal body is c raised to an d immortal 
body, that is from death, even from 
the first death unto life, that they 
can e die no more; their spirits unit-
ing with their bodies, never to be 
divided; thus the whole becoming 
f spiritual and immortal, that they 
can no more see corruption.

46 Now, when Amulek had finished 
these words the people began again 
to be astonished, and also Zeezrom 
began to tremble. And thus ended 
the words of Amulek, or this is all 
that I have written.

CHAPTER 12
Alma speaks to Zeezrom—The mysteries 
of God can be given only to the faith-
ful—Men are judged by their thoughts, 
beliefs, words, and works—The wicked 
will suffer a spiritual death—This mor-
tal  life  is  a  probationary  state—The 
plan of redemption brings to pass the 
Resurrection and, through faith, a re-
mission of sins—The repentant have a 
claim on mercy through the Only Be-
gotten Son. About 82 b.c.
Now Alma, seeing that the words of 
Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for 
he beheld that Amulek had caught 
him in his a lying and deceiving to de-
stroy him, and seeing that he began 
to tremble under a b consciousness  

of his guilt, he opened his mouth 
and began to speak unto him, and 
to establish the words of Amulek, 
and to explain things beyond, or to 
unfold the scriptures beyond that 
which Amulek had done.

2 Now the words that Alma spake 
unto  Zeezrom  were  heard  by  the 
people  round  about;  for  the  mul-
titude was great, and he spake on 
this wise:

3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou 
hast  been  taken  in  thy  lying  and 
craftiness,  for  thou  hast  not  lied 
unto men only but thou hast lied 
unto God; for behold, he knows all 
thy a thoughts, and thou seest that 
thy b thoughts are made known unto 
us by his Spirit;

4 And  thou  seest  that  we  know 
that  thy  plan  was  a  very  a subtle 
plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, 
for to lie and to deceive this peo-
ple  that  thou  mightest  set  them 
against us, to b revile us and to cast  
us out—

5 Now this was a plan of thine a ad-
versary, and he hath exercised his 
power in thee. Now I would that ye 
should remember that what I say 
unto thee I say unto all.

6 And  behold  I  say  unto  you  all 
that this was a a snare of the adver-
sary,  which  he  has  laid  to  catch 
this  people,  that  he  might  bring 
you into subjection unto him, that 
he might encircle you about with 
his  b chains,  that  he  might  chain 
you  down  to  everlasting  destruc-
tion, according to the power of his  
captivity.

7 Now  when  Alma  had  spoken 
these  words,  Zeezrom  began  to 
tremble  more  exceedingly,  for  he 
was convinced more and more of 
the power of God; and he was also

convinced that Alma and Amulek 
had  a  knowledge  of  him,  for  he 
was convinced that they a knew the 
thoughts and intents of his heart; 
for power was given unto them that 
they  might  know  of  these  things 
according to the spirit of prophecy.
8 And Zeezrom began to inquire 
of  them  diligently,  that  he  might 
know  more  concerning  the  king-
dom  of  God.  And  he  said  unto 
Alma: What does this mean which 
Amulek  hath  spoken  concerning 
the resurrection of the dead, that 
all  shall  rise  from  the  dead,  both 
the  a just  and  the  unjust,  and  are 
brought to stand before God to be 
b judged according to their works?
9 And now Alma began to expound 
these  things  unto  him,  saying:  It 
is  given  unto  many  to  a know  the 
b mysteries  of  God;  nevertheless 
they  are  laid  under  a  strict  com-
mand  that  they  shall  not  impart 
c only according to the portion of his 
word which he doth grant unto the 
children of men, according to the 
heed and diligence which they give  
unto him.

10 And  therefore,  he  that  will 
a harden his heart, the same receiv-
eth the b lesser portion of the word; 
and  he  that  will  c not  harden  his 
heart, to him is d given the greater 
portion of the word, until it is given 
unto him to know the mysteries of 
God until he know them in full.

11 And they that will harden their  
hearts, to them is given the lesser 
a portion of the word until they b know 
nothing concerning his mysteries;  

and then they are taken captive by 
the devil, and led by his will down 
to destruction. Now this is what is 
meant by the c chains of d hell.

12 And  Amulek  hath  spoken 
plainly  concerning  a death,  and 
being raised from this mortality to 
a  state  of  immortality,  and  being 
brought before the bar of God, to 
be b judged according to our works.
13 Then  if  our  hearts  have  been 
hardened, yea, if we have hardened 
our hearts against the word, inso-
much that it has not been found in 
us, then will our state be awful, for 
then we shall be condemned.

14 For our a words will condemn us,  
yea,  all  our  works  will  condemn  
us; we shall not be found spotless; 
and our thoughts will also condemn  
us; and in this awful state we shall 
not  dare  to  look  up  to  our  God; 
and  we  would  fain  be  glad  if  we 
could command the rocks and the 
b mountains to fall upon us to c hide 
us from his presence.

15 But  this  cannot  be;  we  must 
come forth and stand before him  
in his glory, and in his power, and in  
his might, majesty, and dominion, 
and acknowledge to our everlasting 
a shame that all his b judgments are 
just; that he is just in all his works, 
and  that  he  is  merciful  unto  the 
children  of  men,  and  that  he  has 
all  power  to  save  every  man  that 
believeth on his name and bringeth 
forth fruit meet for repentance.

16 And now behold, I say unto you 
then cometh a death, even a second

ALMA 12  : 17–26

then is a time that whosoever dieth 
in his sins, as to a temporal b death, 
shall also c die a spiritual death; yea, 
he shall die as to things pertaining 
unto righteousness.

17 Then  is  the  time  when  their 
torments shall be as a a lake of fire 
and  brimstone,  whose  flame  as-
cendeth up forever and ever; and 
then is the time that they shall be 
chained down to an everlasting de-
struction,  according  to  the  power 
and captivity of Satan, he having 
subjected them according to his will.
18 Then, I say unto you, they shall 
be as though there had been a no re-
demption made; for they cannot be 
redeemed according to God’s justice; 
and they cannot b die, seeing there 
is no more corruption.

19 Now it came to pass that when 
Alma had made an end of speaking 
these words, the people began to be 
more astonished;

20 But  there  was  one  Antionah, 
who was a chief ruler among them, 
came forth and said unto him: What 
is this that thou hast said, that man 
should rise from the dead and be 
changed  from  this  mortal  to  an 
a immortal state, that the soul can  
never die?

21 What does the scripture mean, 
which saith that God placed a cheru-
bim  and  a  flaming  sword  on  the  
east of the garden of b Eden, lest our 
first parents should enter and par-
take of the fruit of the tree of life, 
and live forever? And thus we see 
that there was no possible chance 
that they should live forever.

22 Now Alma said unto him: This 

is the thing which I was about to 
explain.  Now  we  see  that  Adam 
did  a fall  by  the  partaking  of  the 
forbidden  b fruit, according to the 
word of God; and thus we see, that 
by his fall, all mankind became a 
c lost and fallen people.

23 And  now  behold,  I  say  unto 
you that if it had been possible for 
Adam to have a partaken of the fruit 
of the tree of life at that time, there 
would have been no death, and the 
word would have been void, mak-
ing God a liar, for he said: b If thou 
eat thou shalt surely die.

24 And we see that a death comes 
upon mankind, yea, the death which 
has  been  spoken  of  by  Amulek, 
which is the temporal death; nev-
ertheless there was a space granted 
unto b man in which he might repent; 
therefore  this  life  became  a  c pro-
bationary state; a time to d prepare 
to meet God; a time to prepare for 
that endless state which has been 
spoken of by us, which is after the 
resurrection of the dead.

25 Now, if it had not been for the 
plan of redemption, which was laid 
from the foundation of the world, 
there  could  have  been  no  a resur-
rection of the dead; but there was 
a plan of b redemption laid, which 
shall  bring  to  pass  the  resurrec-
tion of the dead, of which has been  
spoken.

26 And now behold, if it were pos-
sible  that  our  first  parents  could 
have gone forth and partaken of the 
a tree of life they would have been 
forever miserable, having no pre-
paratory state; and thus the b plan

of redemption would have been frus-
trated, and the word of God would  
have been void, taking none effect.
27 But behold, it was not so; but 
it  was  a appointed  unto  men  that 
they must die; and after death, they 
must come to b judgment, even that 
same judgment of which we have 
spoken, which is the end.

28 And after God had appointed 
that these things should come unto 
man,  behold,  then  he  saw  that  it  
was  expedient  that  man  should 
know concerning the things whereof 
he had appointed unto them;

29 Therefore  he  sent  a angels  to 
converse  with  them,  who  caused 
men to behold of his glory.

30 And they began from that time 
forth to call on his name; therefore 
God a conversed with men, and made 
known unto them the b plan of re-
demption, which had been prepared 
from the c foundation of the world; 
and this he made known unto them 
according to their faith and repen-
tance and their d holy works.

31 Wherefore, he gave a command-
ments unto men, they having first 
transgressed  the  b first  command-
ments  as  to  things  which  were 
temporal,  and  becoming  as  gods, 
c knowing  good  from  evil,  placing 
themselves in a state to d act, or being 
placed in a state to act according to 
their wills and pleasures, whether 
to do evil or to do good—

32 Therefore God gave unto them 
commandments, after having made 
a known unto them the plan of re-
demption, that they should not do 

evil,  the  penalty  thereof  being  a 
second b death, which was an ever-
lasting c death as to things pertain-
ing unto righteousness; for on such 
the plan of redemption could have 
no power, for the works of d justice 
could not be destroyed, according 
to the supreme e goodness of God.

33 But  God  did  call  on  men,  in 
the  name  of  his  Son,  (this  being 
the a plan of redemption which was 
laid) saying: If ye will b repent, and 
harden not your hearts, then will 
I  have  mercy  upon  you,  through 
mine Only Begotten Son;

34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, 
and hardeneth not his heart, he shall 
have claim on a mercy through mine 
Only Begotten Son, unto a b remis-
sion of his sins; and these shall en-
ter into my c rest.

35 And whosoever will harden his 
heart and will do a iniquity, behold, 
I swear in my wrath that he shall 
not enter into my rest.

36 And  now,  my  brethren,  be-
hold I say unto you, that if ye will 
harden your hearts ye shall not en-
ter into the rest of the Lord; there-
fore your iniquity a provoketh him 
that  he  sendeth  down  his  b wrath 
upon you as in the  c first provoca-
tion, yea, according to his word in 
the last provocation as well as the 
first, to the everlasting d destruction 
of your souls; therefore, according 
to his word, unto the last death, as 
well as the first.

37 And now, my brethren, seeing 
we know these things, and they are 
true, let us repent, and harden not

our  hearts,  that  we  a provoke  not 
the Lord our God to pull down his 
wrath upon us in these his second 
commandments which he has given 
unto  us;  but  let  us  enter  into  the 
b rest of God, which is prepared ac-
cording to his word.

CHAPTER 13

Men are called as high priests because  
of their exceeding faith and good works—
They are to teach the commandments—
Through righteousness they are sanctified 
and enter into the rest of the Lord—Mel-
chizedek was one of these—Angels are 
declaring  glad  tidings  throughout  the 
land—They will declare the actual com-
ing of Christ. About 82 b.c.

And  again,  my  brethren,  I  would 
cite your minds forward to the time 
when the Lord God gave these com-
mandments unto his children; and 
I would that ye should remember 
that the Lord God a ordained priests, 
after his holy order, which was after 
the order of his Son, to teach these 
things unto the people.

2 And those priests were ordained 
after  the  a order  of  his  Son,  in  a 
b manner  that  thereby  the  people 
might know in what manner to look 
forward to his Son for redemption.
3 And  this  is  the  manner  after 
which they were ordained—being 
a called  and  b prepared  from  the 
c foundation of the world according 
to the d foreknowledge of God, on ac-
count of their exceeding faith and 
good works; in the first place being 
left to e choose good or evil; there-
fore they having chosen good, and  

exercising exceedingly great f faith, 
are g called with a holy calling, yea, 
with  that  holy  calling  which  was 
prepared with, and according to, a 
preparatory redemption for such.

4 And thus they have been a called 
to this holy calling on account of 
their faith, while others would re-
ject  the  Spirit  of  God  on  account 
of the hardness of their hearts and 
b blindness of their minds, while, if 
it had not been for this they might 
have had as great c privilege as their 
brethren.

5 Or in fine, in the first place they 
were  on  the  a same  standing  with 
their brethren; thus this holy calling 
being prepared from the foundation 
of the world for such as would not 
harden their hearts, being in and 
through the atonement of the Only 
Begotten Son, who was prepared—
6 And  thus  being  called  by  this 
holy calling, and ordained unto the 
high priesthood of the holy order of 
God, to teach his commandments 
unto the children of men, that they 
also might enter into his a rest—

7 This high priesthood being after 
the order of his Son, which order was 
from the foundation of the world; 
or in other words, being  a without 
beginning of days or end of years, 
being  prepared  from  b eternity  to 
all eternity, according to his c fore-
knowledge of all things—

8 Now they were a ordained after 
this  manner—being  called  with  
a holy calling, and ordained with a  
holy  ordinance,  and  taking  upon 
them the high priesthood of the holy 
order, which calling, and ordinance,

and  high  priesthood,  is  without 
beginning or end—

9 Thus they become a high priests 
forever, after the order of the Son, 
the Only Begotten of the Father, who 
is without beginning of days or end 
of years, who is full of b grace, equity,  
and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

10 Now, as I said concerning the 
holy  order,  or  this  a high  priest-
hood, there were many who were 
ordained and became high priests of 
God; and it was on account of their 
exceeding  b faith and  c repentance, 
and their righteousness before God, 
they choosing to repent and work 
righteousness rather than to perish;
11 Therefore they were called af-
ter this holy order, and were a sanc-
tified,  and  their  b garments  were 
washed  white  through  the  blood 
of the Lamb.

12 Now  they,  after  being  a sanc-
tified  by  the  b Holy  Ghost,  having 
their garments made white, being 
c pure and spotless before God, could 
not look upon d sin save it were with 
e abhorrence; and there were many, 
exceedingly great many, who were 
made pure and entered into the rest 
of the Lord their God.

13 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should humble yourselves 
before God, and bring forth a fruit 
meet for repentance, that ye may 
also enter into that rest.

14 Yea, humble yourselves even as 
the people in the days of a Melchi-
zedek, who was also a high priest 
after this same order which I have 

spoken,  who  also  took  upon  him 
the high priesthood forever.

15 And it was this same Melchizedek 
to whom Abraham paid a tithes; yea, 
even our father Abraham paid tithes 
of one-tenth part of all he possessed.
16 Now  these  a ordinances  were 
given after this b manner, that there-
by the people might look forward 
on the Son of God, it being a c type 
of his order, or it being his order, 
and this that they might look for-
ward to him for a remission of their 
sins, that they might enter into the  
rest of the Lord.

17 Now  this  Melchizedek  was  a 
king  over  the  land  of  Salem;  and 
his people had waxed strong in in-
iquity and abomination; yea, they 
had all gone astray; they were full 
of all manner of wickedness;

18 But Melchizedek having exer-
cised mighty faith, and received the 
office of the high priesthood accord-
ing to the a holy order of God, did 
preach repentance unto his people. 
And behold, they did repent; and 
Melchizedek did establish peace in 
the land in his days; therefore he 
was called the prince of peace, for 
he was the king of Salem; and he 
did reign under his father.

19 Now, there were a many before 
him, and also there were many af-
terwards, but  b none were greater; 
therefore, of him they have more 
particularly made mention.

20 Now  I  need  not  rehearse  the 
matter; what I have said may suf-
fice.  Behold,  the  a scriptures  are

before you; if ye will b wrest them 
it shall be to your own destruction.
21 And now it came to pass that 
when  Alma  had  said  these  words 
unto them, he stretched forth his 
hand unto them and cried with a 
mighty  voice,  saying:  a Now  is  the 
time to repent, for the day of sal-
vation draweth nigh;

22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, 
by the  a mouth of angels, doth de-
clare it unto all nations; yea, doth 
declare it, that they may have glad 
tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth 
sound these glad tidings among all 
his people, yea, even to them that 
are scattered abroad upon the face 
of the earth; wherefore they have 
come unto us.

23 And they are made known unto 
us in a plain terms, that we may un-
derstand, that we cannot err; and 
this because of our being b wander-
ers in a strange land; therefore, we 
are thus highly favored, for we have 
these glad tidings declared unto us 
in all parts of our vineyard.

24 For behold, a angels are declar-
ing it unto many at this time in our 
land; and this is for the purpose of 
preparing the hearts of the children 
of men to receive his word at the 
time of his coming in his glory.

25 And now we only wait to hear 
the  joyful  news  declared  unto  us 
by the mouth of angels, of his com-
ing; for the time cometh, we a know 
not how soon. Would to God that 
it might be in my day; but let it be 
sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
26 And it shall be made known unto 
a just and holy men, by the mouth 
of angels, at the time of his coming,  

that the words of our fathers may 
be fulfilled, according to that which 
they have spoken concerning him, 
which was according to the spirit 
of prophecy which was in them.

27 And now, my brethren, I a wish 
from the inmost part of my heart, 
yea, with great b anxiety even unto 
pain, that ye would hearken unto 
my  words,  and  cast  off  your  sins, 
and  not  c procrastinate  the  day  of 
your repentance;

28 But  that  ye  would  humble 
yourselves  before  the  Lord,  and 
call on his holy name, and a watch 
and pray continually, that ye may 
not be b tempted above that which 
ye  can  bear,  and  thus  be  c led  by 
the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, 
d meek, submissive, patient, full of 
love and all long-suffering;

in glory—The prison walls are rent and 
fall—Alma and Amulek are delivered, 
and their persecutors are slain. About 
82– 81 b.c.

And  it  came  to  pass  after  he  had 
made an end of speaking unto the 
people many of them did believe 
on his words, and began to repent, 
and to search the a scriptures.

2 But the more part of them were 
desirous  that  they  might  destroy 
Alma  and  Amulek;  for  they  were 
angry  with  Alma,  because  of  the 
a plainness of his words unto Zeez-
rom; and they also said that Amu-
lek had  b lied unto them, and had 
reviled against their law and also 
against their lawyers and judges.

3 And they were also angry with 
Alma  and  Amulek;  and  because 
they had a testified so plainly against 
their  wickedness,  they  sought  to 
b put them away privily.

4 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did  not;  but  they  took  them  and 
bound them with strong cords, and 
took  them  before  the  chief  judge 
of the land.

5 And the people went forth and 
witnessed against them—testifying 
that  they  had  reviled  against  the  
law, and their lawyers and judges of 
the land, and also of all the people  
that were in the land; and also testi-
fied that there was but one God, and 
that he should send his Son among 
the people, but he should a not save 
them;  and  many  such  things  did 
the people testify against Alma and 
Amulek. Now this was done before 
the chief judge of the land.

6 And it came to pass that Zeez-
rom  was  astonished  at  the  words 
which had been spoken; and he also 
knew concerning the a blindness of 
the  minds,  which  he  had  caused 
among  the  people  by  his  b lying  

words;  and  his  soul  began  to  be 
c harrowed up under a  d conscious-
ness of his own guilt; yea, he began 
to be encircled about by the pains  
of hell.

7 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to cry unto the people, saying: 
Behold, I am a guilty, and these men 
are  spotless  before  God.  And  he 
began to plead for them from that 
time  forth;  but  they  reviled  him, 
saying: Art thou also possessed with 
the devil? And they spit upon him, 
and b cast him out from among them, 
and also all those who believed in 
the words which had been spoken 
by  Alma  and  Amulek;  and  they 
cast them out, and sent men to cast 
stones at them.

8 And  they  brought  their  wives 
and children together, and whoso-
ever  believed  or  had  been  taught 
to believe in the word of God they 
caused  that  they  should  be  a cast 
into the fire; and they also brought 
forth their records which contained 
the holy scriptures, and cast them 
into the fire also, that they might 
be b burned and destroyed by fire.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
took Alma and Amulek, and carried 
them forth to the place of a martyr-
dom, that they might witness the 
destruction of those who were con-
sumed by fire.

10 And  when  Amulek  saw  the 
pains of the women and children 
who were consuming in the fire, he 
also was pained; and he said unto 
Alma: How can we witness this aw-
ful scene? Therefore let us stretch 
forth our hands, and exercise the 
a power of God which is in us, and 
save them from the flames.

11 But Alma said unto him: The 
Spirit constraineth me that I must 
not  stretch  forth  mine  hand;  for 
behold the Lord receiveth them up

unto himself, in a glory; and he doth  
suffer that they may do this thing, 
or that the people may do this thing 
unto them, according to the hard-
ness of their hearts, that the b judg-
ments which he shall exercise upon 
them in his wrath may be just; and 
the  c blood  of  the  d innocent  shall 
stand  as  a  witness  against  them, 
yea, and cry mightily against them 
at the last day.

12 Now Amulek said unto Alma: 
Behold, perhaps they will burn us 
also.

13 And Alma said: Be it according 
to the will of the Lord. But, behold, 
our work is not finished; therefore 
they burn us not.

14 Now it came to pass that when 
the bodies of those who had been 
cast into the fire were consumed, 
and also the records which were cast 
in with them, the chief judge of the 
land came and stood before Alma 
and Amulek, as they were bound; 
and he smote them with his hand 
upon their a cheeks, and said unto 
them: After what ye have seen, will 
ye preach again unto this people, 
that they shall be cast into a b lake 
of fire and brimstone?

15 Behold, ye see that ye had not 
power to save those who had been 
cast into the fire; neither has God 
saved  them  because  they  were  of 
thy faith. And the judge smote them 
again upon their cheeks, and asked: 
What say ye for yourselves?

16 Now  this  judge  was  after  the 
order and faith of a Nehor, who slew 
Gideon.

17 And it came to pass that Alma 
and Amulek answered him a noth-
ing; and he smote them again, and 
delivered them to the officers to be 
b cast into prison.

18 And when they had been cast 

into prison three days, there came 
many  a lawyers,  and  judges,  and 
priests, and teachers, who were of 
the profession of Nehor; and they 
came in unto the prison to see them, 
and  they  questioned  them  about 
many  words;  but  they  answered 
them nothing.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judge stood before them, and said: 
Why  do  ye  not  answer  the  words 
of this people? Know ye not that I 
have a power to deliver you up unto 
the  flames?  And  he  b commanded 
them to speak; but they answered  
nothing.

20 And it came to pass that they 
departed and went their ways, but 
came  again  on  the  morrow;  and 
the  judge  also  smote  them  again 
on  their  cheeks.  And  many  came 
forth also, and smote them, saying: 
Will ye stand again and judge this 
people,  and  condemn  our  law?  If 
ye have such great power why do 
ye not a deliver yourselves?

21 And many such things did they 
say unto them, gnashing their teeth 
upon them, and spitting upon them, 
and saying: How shall we look when 
we are damned?

22 And many such things, yea, all 
manner of such things did they say 
unto them; and thus they did a mock 
them  for  many  days.  And  they  
did withhold food from them that 
they  might  hunger,  and  water  
that they might thirst; and they also 
did  take  from  them  their  clothes 
that they were naked; and thus they 
were b bound with strong cords, and 
confined in c prison.

23 And it came to pass after they 
had  thus  suffered  for  many  days, 
(and it was on the twelfth day, in 
the tenth month, in the tenth year 
of the reign of the judges over the

people  of  Nephi)  that  the  chief 
judge  over  the  land  of  a Ammoni-
hah  and  many  of  their  teachers 
and their lawyers went in unto the 
prison  where  Alma  and  Amulek 
were bound with cords.

24 And the chief judge stood be-
fore them, and smote them again, 
and said unto them: If ye have the 
a power  of  God  deliver  yourselves 
from these bands, and then we will 
believe that the Lord will destroy 
this people according to your words.
25 And it came to pass that they all 
went forth and smote them, saying 
the same words, even until the last; 
and when the last had spoken unto 
them the a power of God was upon 
Alma  and  Amulek,  and  they  rose 
and stood upon their feet.

26 And Alma cried, saying: How 
long  shall  we  suffer  these  great 
a afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, b give 
us strength according to our faith 
which is in Christ, even unto  c de-
liverance. And they broke the cords 
with which they were bound; and 
when the people saw this, they be-
gan to flee, for the fear of destruc-
tion had come upon them.

27 And it came to pass that so great 
was their fear that they fell to the 
earth, and did not obtain the outer 
door of the a prison; and the earth 
shook  mightily,  and  the  walls  of 
the  prison  were  rent  in  twain,  so 
that they fell to the earth; and the 
chief judge, and the lawyers, and 
priests,  and  teachers,  who  smote 
upon Alma and Amulek, were slain 
by the fall thereof.

28 And  Alma  and  Amulek  came 
forth  out  of  the  prison,  and  they 
were  not  hurt;  for  the  Lord  had 
granted unto them a power, accord-
ing to their faith which was in Christ.  

And  they  straightway  came  forth 
out  of  the  prison;  and  they  were 
b loosed from their c bands; and the 
prison had fallen to the earth, and 
every soul within the walls thereof, 
save it were Alma and Amulek, was 
slain;  and  they  straightway  came 
forth into the city.

29 Now the people having heard a 
great noise came running together by 
multitudes to know the cause of it; 
and when they saw Alma and Amu-
lek coming forth out of the prison, 
and the walls thereof had fallen to 
the  earth,  they  were  struck  with 
great fear, and fled from the pres-
ence of Alma and Amulek even as a 
goat fleeth with her young from two 
lions; and thus they did flee from 
the presence of Alma and Amulek.

Alma  and  Amulek  go  to  Sidom  and

rom, who joins the Church—Many are 
baptized,  and  the  Church  prospers—
Alma  and  Amulek  go  to  Zarahemla. 
About 81 b.c.

And it came to pass that Alma and 
Amulek were commanded to depart 
out of that city; and they departed, 
and came out even into the land of  
Sidom; and behold, there they found 
all the people who had departed out  
of the land of     a Ammonihah, who had  
been b cast out and stoned, because 
they believed in the words of Alma.
2 And they related unto them all 
that had happened unto their a wives 
and children, and also concerning 
themselves, and of their b power of 
deliverance.

3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Si-
dom, with a burning fever, which 
was caused by the great tribulations

of his mind on account of his a wick-
edness, for he supposed that Alma 
and Amulek were no more; and he 
supposed that they had been slain 
because  of  his  iniquity.  And  this 
great sin, and his many other sins, 
did harrow up his mind until it did 
become exceedingly sore, having no 
deliverance; therefore he began to 
be scorched with a burning heat.

4 Now, when he heard that Alma 
and Amulek were in the land of Si-
dom, his heart began to take courage;  
and he sent a message immediately 
unto them, desiring them to come 
unto him.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
went immediately, obeying the mes-
sage which he had sent unto them; 
and  they  went  in  unto  the  house 
unto Zeezrom; and they found him 
upon his bed, sick, being very low 
with a burning fever; and his mind 
also was a exceedingly sore because 
of his iniquities; and when he saw 
them he stretched forth his hand, 
and besought them that they would 
heal him.

6 And it came to pass that Alma 
said unto him, taking him by the 
hand: a Believest thou in the power 
of Christ unto salvation?

7 And he answered and said: Yea, 
I  believe  all  the  words  that  thou 
hast taught.

8 And Alma said: If thou believest 
in  the  redemption  of  Christ  thou 
canst be a healed.

9 And  he  said:  Yea,  I  believe  ac-

cording to thy words.

10 And then Alma cried unto the 
Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have 
a mercy on this man, and b heal him 
according to his faith which is in 
Christ.

11 And when Alma had said these 
words,  a Zeezrom  leaped  upon  his  

feet, and began to walk; and this was 
done to the great astonishment of 
all the people; and the knowledge 
of this went forth throughout all the  
land of Sidom.

12 And  Alma  baptized  Zeezrom 
unto the Lord; and he began from 
that time forth to preach unto the 
people.

13 And Alma established a church 
in  the  land  of  Sidom,  and  conse-
crated a priests and b teachers in the 
land, to baptize unto the Lord who-
soever were desirous to be baptized.
14 And it came to pass that they 
were  many;  for  they  did  flock  in 
from  all  the  region  round  about 
Sidom, and were baptized.

15 But as to the people that were 
in the land of Ammonihah, they yet 
remained a hard-hearted and a stiff-
necked people; and they repented 
not of their sins, a ascribing all the 
power of Alma and Amulek to the 
devil; for they were of the profes-
sion of b Nehor, and did not believe 
in the repentance of their sins.

16 And it came to pass that Alma 
and Amulek, Amulek having a for-
saken all his gold, and silver, and 
his precious things, which were in 
the  land  of  Ammonihah,  for  the 
word of God, he being b rejected by 
those who were once his friends and 
also by his father and his kindred;
17 Therefore,  after  Alma  having 
established  the  church  at  Sidom, 
seeing  a  great  a check,  yea,  seeing 
that the people were checked as to 
the pride of their hearts, and began 
to b humble themselves before God, 
and began to assemble themselves 
together at their c sanctuaries to d wor-
ship God before the e altar, f watching 
and praying continually, that they 
might be delivered from Satan, and 
from g death, and from destruction—

18 Now  as  I  said,  Alma  having 
seen all these things, therefore he 
took Amulek and came over to the 
land  of  Zarahemla,  and  took  him 
to his a own house, and did admin-
ister unto him in his tribulations, 
and b strengthened him in the Lord.
19 And thus ended the tenth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 16
The  Lamanites  destroy  the  people  of 
Ammonihah—Zoram leads the Nephites 
to victory over the Lamanites—Alma 
and Amulek and many others preach 
the  word—They  teach  that  after  His 
Resurrection Christ will appear to the 
Nephites. About 81–77 b.c.
And it came to pass in the eleventh 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, on the fifth day 
of the second month, there having 
been  much  peace  in  the  land  of 
Zarahemla,  there  having  been  no 
wars nor contentions for a certain 
number  of  years,  even  until  the 
fifth  day  of  the  second  month  in 
the eleventh year, there was a cry 
of war heard throughout the land.
2 For  behold,  the  armies  of  the 
Lamanites  had  come  in  upon  the 
wilderness  side,  into  the  borders 
of  the  land,  even  into  the  city  of 
a Ammonihah, and began to slay the 
people and destroy the city.

3 And now it came to pass, before 
the Nephites could raise a sufficient 
army to drive them out of the land, 
they had a destroyed the people who 
were  in  the  city  of  Ammonihah, 
and also some around the borders 
of Noah, and taken others captive 
into the wilderness.

4 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  were  desirous  to  obtain 
those who had been carried away 
captive into the wilderness.

5 Therefore,  he  that  had  been 
appointed  chief  captain  over  the 
armies  of  the  Nephites,  (and  his 
name was Zoram, and he had two 
sons,  Lehi  and  Aha)—now  Zoram 
and his two sons, knowing that Alma 
was  high  priest  over  the  church, 
and having heard that he had the 
spirit of prophecy, therefore they 
went unto him and desired of him 
to  know  whither  the  Lord  would 
that  they  should  go  into  the  wil-
derness in search of their brethren, 
who had been taken captive by the  
Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Alma 
a inquired  of  the  Lord  concerning 
the  matter.  And  Alma  returned 
and  said  unto  them:  Behold,  the 
Lamanites will cross the river Sidon 
in  the  south  wilderness,  away  up 
beyond the borders of the land of 
b Manti. And behold there shall ye 
meet them, on the east of the river 
Sidon, and there the Lord will de-
liver unto thee thy brethren who 
have  been  taken  captive  by  the 
Lamanites.

7 And it came to pass that Zoram 
and his sons crossed over the river Si-
don, with their armies, and marched 
away beyond the borders of Manti 
into the south wilderness, which was 
on the east side of the river Sidon.
8 And they came upon the armies 
of the Lamanites, and the Laman-
ites were scattered and driven into 
the wilderness; and they took their 
brethren who had been taken cap-
tive by the Lamanites, and there was 
not one soul of them had been lost 
that were taken captive. And they 
were brought by their brethren to 
possess their own lands.

9 And  thus  ended  the  eleventh 
year of the judges, the Lamanites 
having been driven out of the land, 
and the people of Ammonihah were 
a destroyed; yea, b every living soul

of  the  Ammonihahites  was  c de-
stroyed, and also their d great city, 
which they said God could not de-
stroy, because of its greatness.

10 But behold, in a one day it was 
left desolate; and the b carcasses were 
mangled by dogs and wild beasts 
of the wilderness.

11 Nevertheless, after many days 
their  a dead  bodies  were  heaped 
up upon the face of the earth, and 
they were covered with a shallow 
covering.  And  now  so  great  was 
the  scent  thereof  that  the  people 
did not go in to possess the land of 
Ammonihah for many years. And 
it was called Desolation of b Nehors; 
for they were of the profession of 
Nehor,  who  were  slain;  and  their 
lands remained desolate.

12 And the Lamanites did not come 
again to war against the Nephites 
until  the  fourteenth  year  of  the 
reign of the judges over the people 
of Nephi. And thus for three years 
did the people of Nephi have con-
tinual peace in all the land.

13 And  Alma  and  Amulek  went 
forth preaching repentance to the 
people  in  their  a temples,  and  in 
their b sanctuaries, and also in their 
c synagogues, which were built after 
the manner of the Jews.

14 And  as  many  as  would  hear 
their  words,  unto  them  they  did 
impart  the  word  of  God,  without 
any a respect of persons, continually.
15 And thus did Alma and Amulek 
go forth, and also many more who 
had  been  chosen  for  the  work,  to 
preach the word throughout all the 
land. And the establishment of the 
church became general throughout 

the  land,  in  all  the  region  round 
about, among all the people of the 
Nephites.

16 And there was  a no inequality 
among them; the Lord did pour out 
his Spirit on all the face of the land 
to prepare the minds of the children 
of men, or to prepare their b hearts 
to receive the word which should 
be taught among them at the time 
of his coming—

17 That they might not be hard-
ened  against  the  word,  that  they 
might not be unbelieving, and go on 
to destruction, but that they might 
receive the word with joy, and as 
a a branch be grafted into the true 
vine, that they might enter into the 
b rest of the Lord their God.

18 Now those a priests who did go 
forth among the people did preach 
against all b lyings, and c deceivings, 
and  d envyings,  and  e strifes,  and 
malice, and revilings, and stealing, 
robbing,  plundering,  murdering, 
committing adultery, and all man-
ner  of  lasciviousness,  crying  that 
these things ought not so to be—

19 Holding  forth  things  which 
must  shortly  come;  yea,  holding 
forth the a coming of the Son of God, 
his sufferings and death, and also 
the resurrection of the dead.

20 And many of the people did in-
quire concerning the place where 
the Son of God should come; and 
they  were  taught  that  he  would 
a appear  unto  them  b after  his  res-
urrection; and this the people did 
hear with great joy and gladness.

21 And now after the church had 
been established throughout all the  
land—having got the a victory over

the devil, and the word of God be-
ing preached in its purity in all the 
land, and the Lord pouring out his 
blessings  upon  the  people—thus 
ended  the  fourteenth  year  of  the 
reign of the judges over the people of  
Nephi.

An account of the sons of Mosiah, 
who rejected their rights to the king-
dom for the word of God, and went 
up to the land of Nephi to preach 
to the Lamanites; their sufferings 
and deliverance—according to the 
record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 17 through 27.

CHAPTER 17
The sons of Mosiah have the spirit of 
prophecy  and  of  revelation—They  go 
their several ways to declare the word 
to the Lamanites—Ammon goes to the 
land of Ishmael and becomes the ser-
vant of King Lamoni—Ammon saves 
the king’s flocks and slays his enemies 
at the water of Sebus. Verses 1–3, about 
77 b.c.; verse 4, about 91–77 b.c.; and 
verses 5–39, about 91 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  as 
Alma was journeying from the land 
of Gideon southward, away to the 
land  of  a Manti,  behold,  to  his  as-
tonishment, he b met with the c sons 
of Mosiah journeying towards the 
land of Zarahemla.

2 Now these sons of Mosiah were 
with  Alma  at  the  time  the  angel 
a first appeared unto him; therefore 
Alma  did  rejoice  exceedingly  to 
see his brethren; and what added 
more to his joy, they were still his 
brethren in the Lord; yea, and they 
had waxed strong in the knowledge 
of the truth; for they were men of 

a  sound  understanding  and  they 
had  b searched  the  scriptures  dili-
gently,  that  they  might  know  the 
word of God.

3 But  this  is  not  all;  they  had 
given themselves to much prayer, 
and a fasting; therefore they had the 
spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of 
revelation, and when they taught, 
they  taught  with  b power  and  au-
thority of God.

4 And they had been teaching the 
word of God for the space of fourteen  
years among the Lamanites, having 
had much a success in bringing many 
to the b knowledge of the truth; yea, 
by the power of their words many 
were brought before the altar of God,  
to  call  on  his  name  and  c confess 
their sins before him.

5 Now these are the circumstances 
which attended them in their jour-
neyings, for they had many afflic-
tions; they did suffer much, both in 
body and in mind, such as hunger, 
thirst and fatigue, and also much 
a labor in the spirit.

6 Now these were their journey-
ings: Having  a taken leave of their 
father, Mosiah, in the b first year of 
the judges; having c refused the king-
dom which their father was desir-
ous to confer upon them, and also 
this was the minds of the people;

7 Nevertheless they departed out  
of the land of Zarahemla, and took 
their  swords,  and  their  spears, 
and their bows, and their arrows, 
and their slings; and this they did 
that they might  a provide food for  
themselves while in the wilderness.
8 And  thus  they  departed  into 
the wilderness with their numbers 
which they had a selected, to go up 
to the land of Nephi, to preach the 
word of God unto the Lamanites.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they

journeyed  many  days  in  the  wil-
derness, and they fasted much and 
a prayed much that the Lord would 
grant  unto  them  a  portion  of  his 
Spirit to go with them, and abide 
with them, that they might be an 
b instrument in the hands of God to 
bring, if it were possible, their breth-
ren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge 
of the truth, to the knowledge of the  
baseness of the c traditions of their 
fathers, which were not correct.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did a visit them with his b Spirit, 
and said unto them: Be c comforted. 
And they were comforted.

11 And the Lord said unto them 
also:  Go  forth  among  the  Laman-
ites,  thy  brethren,  and  establish 
my word; yet ye shall be a patient in 
long-suffering and afflictions, that 
ye may show forth good b examples 
unto them in me, and I will make 
an instrument of thee in my hands 
unto the salvation of many souls.

12 And it came to pass that the hearts 
of the sons of Mosiah, and also those  
who were with them, took courage 
to  go  forth  unto  the  Lamanites  to 
declare unto them the word of God.
13 And it came to pass when they 
had arrived in the borders of the 
land  of  the  Lamanites,  that  they 
a separated themselves and departed 
one  from  another,  trusting  in  the 
Lord that they should meet again 
at  the  close  of  their  b harvest;  for 
they  supposed  that  great  was  the 
work which they had undertaken.
14 And  assuredly  it  was  great, 
for they had undertaken to preach 
the word of God to a  a wild and a 
hardened and a ferocious people; 
a people who delighted in murder-
ing the Nephites, and robbing and 
plundering them; and their hearts 
were set upon riches, or upon gold 

and silver, and precious stones; yet 
they sought to obtain these things 
by murdering and plundering, that 
they might not labor for them with 
their own hands.

15 Thus they were a very indolent 
people, many of whom did worship 
idols,  and  the  a curse  of  God  had 
fallen  upon  them  because  of  the 
b traditions of their fathers; notwith-
standing the promises of the Lord 
were  extended  unto  them  on  the 
conditions of repentance.

16 Therefore, this was the a cause 
for which the sons of Mosiah had 
undertaken the work, that perhaps 
they  might  bring  them  unto  re-
pentance; that perhaps they might 
bring them to know of the plan of 
redemption.

17 Therefore they separated them-
selves one from another, and went 
forth among them, every man alone, 
according to the word and power 
of God which was given unto him.
18 Now  Ammon  being  the  chief 
among them, or rather he did ad-
minister unto them, and he departed 
from  them,  after  having  a blessed 
them  according  to  their  several 
stations, having imparted the word 
of God unto them, or administered 
unto them before his departure; and 
thus  they  took  their  several  jour-
neys throughout the land.

19 And Ammon went to the land 
of a Ishmael, the land being called 
after the sons of b Ishmael, who also 
became Lamanites.

20 And as Ammon entered the land 
of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him 
and a bound him, as was their cus-
tom to bind all the Nephites who 
fell into their hands, and carry them 
before the king; and thus it was left 
to the pleasure of the king to slay 
them, or to retain them in captivity,

or  to  cast  them  into  prison,  or  to  
cast them out of his land, according 
to his will and pleasure.

21 And thus Ammon was carried 
before the king who was over the 
land of Ishmael; and his name was 
Lamoni; and he was a descendant 
of Ishmael.

22 And the king inquired of Am-
mon if it were his desire to dwell 
in the land among the Lamanites, 
or among his people.

23 And  Ammon  said  unto  him: 
Yea, I desire to  a dwell among this 
people for a time; yea, and perhaps 
until the day I die.

24 And it came to pass that king 
Lamoni  was  much  pleased  with 
Ammon, and caused that his bands 
should  be  loosed;  and  he  would 
that Ammon should take one of his 
daughters to wife.

25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, 
but I will be thy servant. Therefore 
Ammon became a a servant to king 
Lamoni. And it came to pass that 
he was set among other servants to 
watch the flocks of Lamoni, accord-
ing to the custom of the Lamanites.
26 And after he had been in the 
service of the king three days, as he 
was with the Lamanitish servants 
going forth with their flocks to the 
place of  a water, which was called 
the water of Sebus, and all the La-
manites  drive  their  flocks  hither, 
that they may have water—

27 Therefore, as Ammon and the 
servants of the king were driving 
forth  their  flocks  to  this  place  of 
water, behold, a certain number of 
the Lamanites, who had been with 
their  flocks  to  water,  stood  and 
a scattered the flocks of Ammon and 
the servants of the king, and they 
scattered them insomuch that they 
fled many ways.

28 Now  the  servants  of  the  king 
began  to  murmur,  saying:  Now 
the king will slay us, as he has our 
brethren because their flocks were 

scattered by the wickedness of these 
men. And they began to weep ex-
ceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks 
are scattered already.

29 Now they wept because of the 
fear of being slain. Now when Am-
mon saw this his heart was swollen 
within him with joy; for, said he, 
I  will  show  forth  my  power  unto 
these  my  fellow-servants,  or  the 
power which is in me, in restoring 
these  flocks  unto  the  king,  that  I 
may  win  the  hearts  of  these  my  
fellow-servants,  that  I  may  lead 
them to a believe in my words.

30 And  now,  these  were  the 
thoughts of Ammon, when he saw 
the  afflictions  of  those  whom  he 
termed to be his brethren.

31 And it came to pass that he flat-
tered them by his words, saying: My 
brethren, be of good cheer and let 
us go in search of the flocks, and 
we will gather them together and 
bring them back unto the place of 
water;  and  thus  we  will  preserve 
the  flocks  unto  the  king  and  he 
will not slay us.

32 And it came to pass that they 
went  in  search  of  the  flocks,  and 
they did follow Ammon, and they 
rushed forth with much swiftness 
and  did  head  the  flocks  of  the 
king, and did gather them together  
again to the place of water.

33 And those men again stood to 
scatter  their  flocks;  but  Ammon 
said  unto  his  brethren:  Encircle 
the  flocks  round  about  that  they 
flee not; and I go and contend with 
these men who do scatter our flocks.
34 Therefore, they did as Ammon 
commanded them, and he went forth  
and  stood  to  contend  with  those 
who stood by the waters of Sebus; 
and they were in number not a few.
35 Therefore  they  did  not  fear 
Ammon,  for  they  supposed  that 
one  of  their  men  could  slay  him 
according  to  their  pleasure,  for 
they  knew  not  that  the  Lord  had

promised  Mosiah  that  he  would 
a deliver his sons out of their hands; 
neither  did  they  know  anything 
concerning  the  Lord;  therefore 
they delighted in the destruction of 
their brethren; and for this cause 
they stood to scatter the flocks of 
the king.

36 But  a Ammon  stood  forth  and 
began to cast stones at them with 
his sling; yea, with mighty power 
he did sling stones amongst them; 
and thus he slew a b certain number 
of them insomuch that they began 
to be astonished at his power; nev-
ertheless they were angry because 
of the slain of their brethren, and 
they  were  determined  that  he 
should  fall;  therefore,  seeing  that 
they c could not hit him with their 
stones, they came forth with clubs to  
slay him.

37 But  behold,  every  man  that 
lifted his club to smite Ammon, he 
smote off their arms with his sword; 
for he did withstand their blows by 
smiting  their  arms  with  the  edge 
of  his  sword,  insomuch  that  they 
began to be astonished, and began  
to  flee  before  him;  yea,  and  they  
were  not  few  in  number;  and  he 
caused them to flee by the strength  
of his arm.

38 Now six of them had fallen by 
the sling, but he a slew none save it 
were their leader with his sword; 
and he smote off as many of their 
arms  as  were  lifted  against  him, 
and they were not a few.

39 And when he had driven them 
afar off, he returned and they wa-
tered their flocks and returned them 
to the pasture of the king, and then 
went in unto the king, bearing the 
arms which had been smitten off 
by the sword of Ammon, of those 
who sought to slay him; and they 
were carried in unto the king for a 
testimony of the things which they 
had done.

CHAPTER 18

King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is 
the Great Spirit—Ammon teaches the 
king  about  the  Creation,  God’s  deal-
ings  with  men,  and  the  redemption 
that  comes  through  Christ—Lamoni 
believes and falls to the earth as if dead. 
About 90 b.c.
And it came to pass that king La-
moni  caused  that  his  a servants 
should  stand  forth  and  testify  to 
all the things which they had seen 
concerning the matter.

2 And when they had all testified 
to the things which they had seen, 
and he had learned of the faithful-
ness  of  Ammon  in  preserving  his 
flocks, and also of his a great power 
in  contending  against  those  who 
sought to slay him, he was aston-
ished exceedingly, and said: Surely, 
this  is  more  than  a  man.  Behold, 
is  not  this  the  Great  Spirit  who 
doth send such great punishments 
upon this people, because of their 
murders?

3 And  they  answered  the  king, 
and said: Whether he be the Great 
Spirit or a man, we know not; but 
this  much  we  do  know,  that  he 
a cannot  be  slain  by  the  enemies  
of the king; neither can they b scatter 
the  king’s  flocks  when  he  is  with 
us, because of his expertness and 
c great strength; therefore, we know 
that he is a friend to the king. And 
now, O king, we do not believe that 
a man has such great power, for we 
know he cannot be slain.

4 And now, when the king heard 
these words, he said unto them: Now 
I  know  that  it  is  the  Great  Spirit; 
and he has come down at this time 
to preserve your lives, that I might 
not  a slay you as I did your breth-
ren.  Now  this  is  the  Great  Spirit 
of whom our fathers have spoken.
5 Now  this  was  the  a tradition  of 
Lamoni,  which  he  had  received

from  his  father,  that  there  was  a 
b Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they 
believed in a Great Spirit, they sup-
posed that c whatsoever they did was 
right; nevertheless, Lamoni began 
to fear exceedingly, with fear lest 
he had done wrong in slaying his 
servants;

6 For he had slain many of them 
because their brethren had scattered 
their flocks at the place of water; 
and thus, because they had had their 
flocks scattered they were slain.

7 Now it was the practice of these 
Lamanites to stand by the a waters 
of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the 
people,  that  thereby  they  might 
drive  away  many  that  were  scat-
tered unto their own land, it being 
a practice of plunder among them.
8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Lamoni  inquired  of  his  servants, 
saying: Where is this man that has 
such great power?

9 And they said unto him: Behold, 
he is feeding thy a horses. Now the 
king had commanded his servants, 
previous to the time of the water-
ing of their flocks, that they should 
prepare  his  horses  and  chari ots, 
and conduct him forth to the land 
of  Nephi;  for  there  had  been  a 
b great c feast appointed at the land 
of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, 
who was king over all the land.

10 Now when king Lamoni heard 
that  Ammon  was  preparing  his 
horses and his a chariots he was more 
astonished, because of the faithful-
ness of Ammon, saying: Surely there 
has not been any servant among all 
my servants that has been so faith-
ful  as  this  man;  for  even  he  doth 
remember all my commandments 
to execute them.

11 Now I surely know that this is 
the Great Spirit, and I would desire 

him that he come in unto me, but 
I durst not.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon had made ready the horses 
and the chariots for the king and 
his  servants,  he  went  in  unto  the 
king,  and  he  saw  that  the  a coun-
tenance of the king was changed; 
therefore  he  was  about  to  return 
out of his presence.

13 And one of the king’s servants 
said unto him,  a Rabbanah, which 
is, being interpreted, powerful or 
great king, considering their kings 
to  be  powerful;  and  thus  he  said 
unto him: Rabbanah, the king de-
sireth thee to stay.

14 Therefore Ammon turned him-
self  unto  the  king,  and  said  unto 
him: What wilt thou that I should 
do for thee, O king? And the king 
answered him not for the space of 
an  a hour, according to their time, 
for  he  knew  not  what  he  should 
say unto him.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  said  unto  him  again:  What 
desirest thou of me? But the king 
answered him not.

16 And it came to pass that Am-
mon, being filled with the  a Spirit 
of God, therefore he perceived the 
b thoughts of the king. And he said 
unto  him:  Is  it  because  thou  hast 
heard that I defended thy servants 
and thy flocks, and slew c seven of 
their brethren with the sling and 
with the sword, and smote off the 
arms of others, in order to defend thy 
flocks and thy servants; behold, is  
it this that causeth thy marvelings?
17 I say unto you, what is it, that 
thy marvelings are so great? Behold, 
I am a  a man, and am thy servant; 
therefore, whatsoever thou desirest 
which is right, that will I do.

18 Now when the king had heard

these  words,  he  marveled  again, 
for  he  beheld  that  Ammon  could 
a discern his thoughts; but notwith-
standing this, king Lamoni did open 
his mouth, and said unto him: Who 
art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, 
who b knows all things?

19 Ammon answered and said unto 

him: I am not.

20 And the king said: How know-
est thou the thoughts of my heart? 
Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell 
me concerning these things; and also 
tell me by what power ye slew and 
smote off the arms of my brethren 
that scattered my flocks—

21 And now, a if thou wilt tell me 
concerning  these  things,  whatso-
ever thou desirest I will give unto 
thee; and if it were needed, I would 
guard thee with my armies; but I 
know that thou art more powerful 
than  all  they;  nevertheless,  what-
soever  thou  desirest  of  me  I  will 
grant it unto thee.

22 Now Ammon being  a wise, yet 
harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt 
thou hearken unto my words, if I 
tell thee by what power I do these 
things? And this is the thing that I 
desire of thee.

23 And  the  king  answered  him, 
and  said:  Yea,  I  a will  believe  all 
thy words. And thus he was caught 
with b guile.

24 And  Ammon  began  to  speak 
unto  him  with  a boldness,  and 
said unto him: Believest thou that  
there is a God?

25 And  he  answered,  and  said 
unto him: I do not know what that 
meaneth.

26 And then Ammon said: Believest 

thou that there is a a Great Spirit?

27 And he said, Yea.
28 And Ammon said: This is God. 

And Ammon said unto him again: 
Believest thou that this Great Spirit, 
who is God, created all things which 
are in heaven and in the earth?

29 And he said: Yea, I believe that 
he created all things which are in 
the  earth;  but  I  do  not  know  the 
heavens.

30 And  Ammon  said  unto  him: 
The heavens is a place where God 
dwells and all his holy angels.

31 And  king  Lamoni  said:  Is  it 

above the earth?

32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he 
looketh  down  upon  all  the  chil-
dren of men; and he a knows all the 
thoughts and b intents of the heart; 
for by his hand were they all cre-
ated from the beginning.

33 And king Lamoni said: I believe 
all  these  things  which  thou  hast 
spoken. Art thou a sent from God?

34 Ammon said unto him: I am a 
a man; and man in the beginning was 
created after the image of God, and I 
am called by his b Holy Spirit to teach 
these things unto this people, that 
they may be brought to a knowledge  
of that which is just and true;

35 And  a  portion  of  that  a Spirit 
dwelleth  in  me,  which  giveth  me 
b knowledge, and also power accord-
ing to my faith and desires which 
are in God.

36 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these  words,  he  began  at  the  cre-
ation  of  the  world,  and  also  the 
creation of Adam, and told him all 
the  things  concerning  the  fall  of 
man, and  a rehearsed and laid be-
fore him the b records and the holy 
scriptures of the people, which had 
been spoken by the c prophets, even 
down to the time that their father, 
Lehi, left Jerusalem.

them (for it was unto the king and to  
his servants) all the journeyings of 
their fathers in the wilderness, and 
all their sufferings with hunger and 
thirst, and their travail, and so forth.
38 And he also rehearsed unto them 
concerning the a rebellions of Laman 
and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, 
yea, all their rebellions did he relate 
unto them; and he expounded unto 
them all the b records and scriptures 
from the time that Lehi left Jerusa-
lem down to the present time.

39 But this is not all; for he  a ex-
pounded  unto  them  the  b plan  of 
redemption,  which  was  prepared 
from the foundation of the world; 
and he also made known unto them 
concerning  the  coming  of  Christ, 
and all the works of the Lord did 
he make known unto them.

40 And it came to pass that after 
he  had  said  all  these  things,  and 
expounded them to the king, that 
the king a believed all his words.

41 And he began to cry unto the 
Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; 
according to thy abundant a mercy 
which thou hast had upon the peo-
ple  of  Nephi,  have  upon  me,  and 
my people.

42 And  now,  when  he  had  said 
this, he  a fell unto the earth,  b as if 
he were dead.

43 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
a servants took him and carried him 
in unto his wife, and laid him upon 
a bed; and he lay as if he were dead 
for the space of two days and two 
nights; and his wife, and his sons, 
and  his  daughters  mourned  over 
him,  after  the  manner  of  the  La-
manites, greatly lamenting his loss.

CHAPTER 19
Lamoni receives the light of everlasting 
life and sees the Redeemer—His house-

hold falls into a trance, and many see 
angels—Ammon  is  preserved  miracu-
lously—He baptizes many and establishes  
a church among them. About 90 b.c.

And it came to pass that after two 
days and two nights they were about 
to take his a body and lay it in a sep-
ulchre,  which  they  had  made  for 
the purpose of burying their dead.
2 Now the queen having heard of 
the fame of Ammon, therefore she 
sent  and  desired  that  he  should 
come in unto her.

3 And it came to pass that Ammon  
did  as  he  was  commanded,  and 
went in unto the queen, and desired  
to  know  what  she  would  that  he 
should do.

4 And she said unto him: The a ser-
vants of my husband have made it  
known  unto  me  that  thou  art  a 
b prophet  of  a  holy  God,  and  that 
thou hast c power to do many mighty 
works in his name;

5 Therefore,  if  this  is  the  case,  I 
would  that  ye  should  go  in  and  
see  my  husband,  for  he  has  been  
laid  upon  his  bed  for  the  space 
of  two  days  and  two  nights;  and 
some say that he is not dead, but 
others say that he is dead and that 
he a stinketh, and that he ought to 
be placed in the sepulchre; but as 
for myself, to me he doth not stink.
6 Now, this was what Ammon de-
sired, for he knew that king Lam-
oni was under the power of God; he 
knew that the dark a veil of b unbe-
lief was being cast away from his 
mind, and the c light which did light  
up his mind, which was the light of  
the glory of God, which was a mar-
velous light of his goodness—yea, 
this light had infused such joy into 
his soul, the cloud of darkness hav-
ing  been  dispelled,  and  that  the 
light of everlasting life was lit up in

his soul, yea, he knew that this had 
d overcome his natural frame, and 
he was carried away in God—

7 Therefore,  what  the  queen  de-
sired  of  him  was  his  only  desire. 
Therefore,  he  went  in  to  see  the 
king  according  as  the  queen  had 
desired him; and he saw the king, 
and he knew that he was not dead.
8 And  he  said  unto  the  queen: 
He is not dead, but he sleepeth in 
God, and on the morrow he shall 
rise again; therefore bury him not.
9 And  Ammon  said  unto  her: 
a Believest thou this? And she said 
unto  him:  I  have  had  no  witness 
save thy word, and the word of our 
servants;  nevertheless  I  b believe 
that it shall be according as thou  
hast said.

10 And  Ammon  said  unto  her: 
Blessed  art  thou  because  of  thy 
exceeding  faith;  I  say  unto  thee, 
woman,  there  has  not  been  such 
great faith among all the people of 
the a Nephites.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  she 
watched over the bed of her hus-
band, from that time even until that 
time on the morrow which Ammon 
had appointed that he should rise.
12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
arose, according to the words of Am-
mon; and as he arose, he stretched 
forth  his  hand  unto  the  woman, 
and  said:  Blessed  be  the  name  of 
God, and blessed art thou.

13 For as sure as thou livest, be-
hold,  I  have  a seen  my  Redeemer; 
and  he  shall  come  forth,  and  be 
b born of a c woman, and he shall re-
deem all mankind who believe on 
his name. Now, when he had said 
these words, his heart was swollen 
within him, and he sunk again with 
joy; and the queen also sunk down, 
being overpowered by the Spirit.

14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit 

of the Lord poured out according to 
his a prayers upon the Lamanites, his 
brethren, who had been the cause 
of  so  much  mourning  among  the 
Nephites, or among all the people 
of God because of their iniquities 
and their b traditions, he fell upon 
his knees, and began to pour out his 
soul in prayer and thanksgiving to 
God for what he had done for his 
brethren; and he was also overpow-
ered  with  c joy;  and  thus  they  all 
three had d sunk to the earth.

15 Now, when the servants of the 
king had seen that they had fallen, 
they  also  began  to  cry  unto  God, 
for the fear of the Lord had come 
upon  them  also,  for  it  was  a they 
who had stood before the king and 
testified unto him concerning the 
great power of Ammon.

16 And it came to pass that they 
did call on the name of the Lord, in 
their might, even until they had all 
fallen to the earth, save it were one 
of the Lamanitish a women, whose 
name was Abish, she having been 
converted unto the Lord for many 
years, on account of a remarkable 
vision of her father—

17 Thus, having been converted to 
the Lord, and never having made 
it a known, therefore, when she saw 
that all the servants of Lamoni had 
b fallen  to  the  earth,  and  also  her 
mistress, the queen, and the king, 
and  Ammon  lay  c prostrate  upon 
the earth, she knew that it was the 
power of God; and supposing that 
this opportunity, by making known 
unto the people what had happened 
among them, that by beholding this 
scene it would  d cause them to be-
lieve in the power of God, therefore 
she ran forth from house to house, 
making it known unto the people.
18 And  they  began  to  assemble 
themselves together unto the house

of the king. And there came a mul-
titude, and to their astonishment, 
they beheld the king, and the queen, 
and their servants prostrate upon 
the earth, and they all lay there as 
though  they  were  dead;  and  they 
also  saw  Ammon,  and  behold,  he 
was a Nephite.

19 And now the people began to 
murmur among themselves; some 
saying that it was a great evil that 
had come upon them, or upon the 
king and his house, because he had 
suffered  that  the  Nephite  should 
a remain in the land.

20 But others rebuked them, say-
ing: The king hath brought this evil 
upon his house, because he slew his 
servants who had had their flocks 
scattered at the a waters of Sebus.

21 And  they  were  also  rebuked 
by those men who had stood at the 
waters of Sebus and a scattered the 
flocks which belonged to the king, 
for they were angry with Ammon 
because  of  the  number  which  he 
had slain of their brethren at the 
waters  of  Sebus,  while  defending 
the flocks of the king.

22 Now, one of them, whose brother 
had been a slain with the sword of 
Ammon, being exceedingly angry 
with Ammon, drew his sword and 
went forth that he might let it fall 
upon Ammon, to slay him; and as 
he  lifted  the  sword  to  smite  him, 
behold, he fell dead.

23 Now we see that Ammon could 
not be slain, for the a Lord had said 
unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare 
him, and it shall be unto him ac-
cording  to  thy  faith—therefore, 
Mosiah b trusted him unto the Lord.
24 And it came to pass that when 
the multitude beheld that the man 
had  fallen  dead,  who  lifted  the 
sword to slay Ammon,  a fear came 
upon them all, and they durst not 
put forth their hands to touch him 

or any of those who had fallen; and 
they began to marvel again among 
themselves what could be the cause 
of this great power, or what all these 
things could mean.

25 And it came to pass that there 
were many among them who said 
that Ammon was the a Great Spirit, 
and others said he was sent by the 
Great Spirit;

26 But  others  rebuked  them  all, 
saying that he was a a monster, who 
had been sent from the Nephites to 
torment them.

27 And there were some who said 
that Ammon was sent by the Great 
Spirit  to  afflict  them  because  of 
their  iniquities;  and  that  it  was 
the Great Spirit that had always at-
tended the Nephites, who had ever 
delivered them out of their hands; 
and they said that it was this Great 
Spirit who had destroyed so many 
of their brethren, the Lamanites.

28 And  thus  the  contention  be-
gan to be exceedingly sharp among 
them.  And  while  they  were  thus 
contending,  the  a woman  servant 
who had caused the multitude to 
be  gathered  together  came,  and 
when she saw the contention which 
was among the multitude she was 
exceedingly  sorrowful,  even  unto  
tears.

29 And  it  came  to  pass  that  she 
went  and  took  the  queen  by  the 
a hand, that perhaps she might raise 
her from the ground; and as soon 
as she touched her hand she arose 
and stood upon her feet, and cried 
with a loud voice, saying: O blessed 
Jesus,  who  has  saved  me  from  an 
b awful  hell!  O  blessed  God,  have 
c mercy on this people!

30 And when she had said this, she 
clasped her hands, being filled with 
joy,  speaking  many  words  which 
were not understood; and when she 
had  done  this,  she  took  the  king,

Lamoni, by the hand, and behold 
he arose and stood upon his feet.

31 And  he,  immediately,  seeing 
the contention among his people, 
went  forth  and  began  to  rebuke 
them, and to teach them the a words 
which he had heard from the mouth 
of Ammon; and as many as heard 
his words believed, and were con-
verted unto the Lord.

32 But  there  were  a many  among 
them who would not hear his words; 
therefore they went their way.

33 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon arose he also administered 
unto them, and also did all the ser-
vants of Lamoni; and they did all 
declare unto the people the selfsame 
thing—that their hearts had been 
a changed;  that  they  had  no  more 
desire to do b evil.

34 And behold, many did declare 
unto the people that they had seen 
a angels and had conversed with them; 
and thus they had told them things 
of God, and of his righteousness.

35 And it came to pass that there 
were many that did a believe in their 
words; and as many as did believe 
were baptized; and they became a 
righteous people, and they did es-
tablish a church among them.

36 And thus the work of the Lord 
did commence among the Laman-
ites; thus the Lord did begin to pour 
out his a Spirit upon them; and we 
see that his arm is extended to b all 
people who will repent and believe 
on his name.

CHAPTER 20
The Lord sends Ammon to Middoni to 
deliver his imprisoned brethren—Am-
mon and Lamoni meet Lamoni’s father, 
who is king over all the land—Ammon 
compels  the  old  king  to  approve  the 
release of his brethren. About 90 b.c.

And it came to pass that when they 
had  established  a  church  in  that 
a land, that king Lamoni desired that 
Ammon should go with him to the 
land of Nephi, that he might show 
him unto his father.

2 And the voice of the Lord came 
to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go 
up to the land of Nephi, for behold, 
the king will seek thy life; but thou 
shalt go to the land of a Middoni; for 
behold, thy brother Aaron, and also 
Muloki and Ammah are in prison.
3 Now it came to pass that when 
Ammon had heard this, he said unto 
Lamoni:  Behold,  my  brother  and 
brethren are in prison at Middoni, 
and I go that I may deliver them.

4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: 
I know, in the a strength of the Lord 
thou canst do all things. But behold, 
I will go with thee to the land of  
Middoni; for the king of the land  
of  Middoni,  whose  name  is  Anti-
omno, is a friend unto me; therefore 
I go to the land of Middoni, that I 
may  flatter  the  king  of  the  land, 
and he will cast thy brethren out 
of b prison. Now Lamoni said unto 
him: Who told thee that thy breth-
ren were in prison?

5 And Ammon said unto him: No 
one hath told me, save it be God; 
and he said unto me—Go and de-
liver thy brethren, for they are in 
prison in the land of Middoni.

6 Now  when  Lamoni  had  heard 
this  he  caused  that  his  servants 
should make ready his a horses and 
his chariots.

7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, 
I will go with thee down to the land 
of Middoni, and there I will plead 
with the king that he will cast thy 
brethren out of prison.

thither,  they  met  the  father  of 
Lamoni,  who  was  king  a over  all  
the land.

9 And  behold,  the  father  of  La-
moni  said  unto  him:  Why  did  ye 
a not come to the b feast on that great 
day when I made a feast unto my 
sons, and unto my people?

10 And he also said: Whither art 
thou going with this Nephite, who 
is one of the children of a a liar?

11 And it came to pass that La-
moni rehearsed unto him whither 
he was going, for he feared to offend  
him.

12 And  he  also  told  him  all  the 
cause  of  his  tarrying  in  his  own 
kingdom, that he did not go unto 
his father to the feast which he had 
prepared.

13 And now when Lamoni had re-
hearsed unto him all these things, 
behold,  to  his  astonishment,  his 
father was angry with him, and said: 
Lamoni, thou art going to deliver 
these Nephites, who are sons of a 
liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; 
and now his children are also come 
amongst us that they may, by their 
cunning and their lyings, deceive 
us, that they again may rob us of 
our property.

14 Now the father of Lamoni com-
manded  him  that  he  should  slay 
Ammon  with  the  sword.  And  he 
also commanded him that he should 
not go to the land of Middoni, but 
that he should return with him to 
the land of a Ishmael.

15 But  Lamoni  said  unto  him:  I 
will not slay Ammon, neither will 
I return to the land of Ishmael, but 
I go to the land of Middoni that I 
may release the brethren of Ammon, 
for I know that they are just men 
and holy prophets of the true God.
16 Now when his father had heard 
these  words,  he  was  angry  with 
him,  and  he  drew  his  sword  that 
he might smite him to the earth.

17 But  Ammon  stood  forth  and 
said unto him: Behold, thou shalt 
not  slay  thy  son;  nevertheless,  it 
were a better that he should fall than 
thee, for behold, he has b repented 
of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall 
at this time, in thine anger, thy soul 
could not be saved.

18 And again, it is expedient that 
thou shouldst forbear; for if thou 
shouldst a slay thy son, he being an 
innocent man, his blood would cry 
from  the  ground  to  the  Lord  his 
God, for vengeance to come upon 
thee;  and  perhaps  thou  wouldst 
lose thy b soul.

19 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these words unto him, he answered 
him, saying: I know that if I should 
slay my son, that I should shed in-
nocent blood; for it is thou that hast 
sought to destroy him.

20 And he stretched forth his hand 
to slay Ammon. But Ammon with-
stood his blows, and also smote his 
arm that he could not use it.

21 Now  when  the  king  saw  that 
Ammon could slay him, he began 
to plead with Ammon that he would 
spare his life.

22 But Ammon raised his sword, 
and said unto him: Behold, I will 
smite thee except thou wilt grant 
unto me that my brethren may be 
a cast out of prison.

23 Now the king, fearing he should 
lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare 
me I will grant unto thee whatso-
ever thou wilt ask, even to half of 
the kingdom.

24 Now when Ammon saw that he 
had wrought upon the old king ac-
cording to his desire, he said unto 
him:  If  thou  wilt  grant  that  my 
brethren may be cast out of prison, 
and also that Lamoni may retain his 
kingdom,  and  that  ye  be  not  dis-
pleased with him, but grant that he 
may do according to his own desires 
in a whatsoever thing he thinketh,

then will I spare thee; otherwise I 
will smite thee to the earth.

25 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these words, the king began to re-
joice because of his life.

26 And when he saw that Ammon 
had no desire to destroy him, and 
when  he  also  saw  the  great  a love 
he had for his son Lamoni, he was 
astonished  exceedingly,  and  said: 
Because  this  is  all  that  thou  hast 
desired,  that  I  would  b release  thy 
brethren,  and  suffer  that  my  son 
Lamoni should retain his kingdom, 
behold, I will grant unto you that 
my  son  may  retain  his  kingdom 
from this time and forever; and I 
will govern him no more—

27 And I will also grant unto thee 
that thy brethren may be cast out 
of prison, and thou and thy breth-
ren may come unto me, in my king-
dom;  for  I  shall  greatly  desire  to 
see thee. For the king was greatly 
astonished  at  the  words  which  he 
had spoken, and also at the words 
which had been spoken by his son 
Lamoni, therefore he was a desirous to  
learn them.

28 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  Lamoni  proceeded  on 
their journey towards the land of 
Middoni. And Lamoni found favor 
in the eyes of the king of the land; 
therefore the brethren of Ammon 
were brought forth out of prison.

29 And  when  Ammon  did  meet 
them he was exceedingly sorrowful, 
for  behold  they  were  naked,  and 
their skins were worn exceedingly 
because of being bound with strong 
cords. And they also had a suffered 
hunger, thirst, and all kinds of af-
flictions;  nevertheless  they  were 
b patient in all their sufferings.

30 And, as it happened, it was their  
lot to have fallen into the hands of  
a more hardened and a more a stiff-
necked people; therefore they would 
not hearken unto their words, and 

they  had  cast  them  out,  and  had 
smitten them, and had driven them 
from  house  to  house,  and  from 
place to place, even until they had 
arrived in the land of Middoni; and 
there they were taken and cast into 
prison,  and  bound  with  b strong 
cords, and kept in prison for many 
days, and were delivered by La moni 
and Ammon.

An  account  of  the  preaching  of 
Aaron, and Muloki, and their breth-
ren, to the Lamanites.

CHAPTER 21

Aaron  teaches  the  Amalekites  about 
Christ  and  His  Atonement—Aaron 
and  his  brethren  are  imprisoned  in 
Middoni—After their deliverance, they 
teach in the synagogues and make many 
converts—Lamoni grants religious free-
dom to the people in the land of Ishmael. 
About 90–77 b.c.
Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren  a separated  themselves  in  the 
borders of the land of the Laman-
ites, behold Aaron took his journey 
towards the land which was called 
by the Lamanites, b Jerusalem, call-
ing it after the land of their fathers’ 
nativity;  and  it  was  away  joining 
the borders of Mormon.

2 Now  the  Lamanites  and  the 
Amalekites and the people of a Amu-
lon  had  built  a  great  city,  which 
was called Jerusalem.

3 Now the Lamanites of themselves 
were  sufficiently  hardened,  but  
the Amalekites and the Amulonites 
were  still  harder;  therefore  they 
did cause the Lamanites that they 
should  harden  their  hearts,  that  
they should wax strong in wicked-
ness and their abominations.

4 And it came to pass that Aaron 
came to the city of Jerusalem, and

first began to preach to the Amale-
kites.  And  he  began  to  preach  to 
them in their a synagogues, for they 
had built synagogues after the b or-
der of the Nehors; for many of the 
Amalekites  and  the  Amulonites 
were after the order of the Nehors.
5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into 
one of their a synagogues to preach 
unto  the  people,  and  as  he  was 
speaking unto them, behold there 
arose  an  Amalekite  and  began  to 
contend with him, saying: What is 
that thou hast testified? Hast thou 
seen an b angel? Why do not angels 
appear  unto  us?  Behold  c are  not 
this people as good as thy people?
6 Thou also sayest, except we re-
pent we shall perish. How knowest 
thou the thought and intent of our 
hearts? How knowest thou that we 
have cause to repent? How knowest 
thou that we are not a a righteous peo-
ple? Behold, we have built b sanctu-
aries, and we do assemble ourselves  
together  to  worship  c God.  We  do 
believe that God will save all men.
7 Now Aaron said unto him: Be-
lievest  thou  that  the  Son  of  God 
shall  come  to  redeem  mankind 
from their sins?

8 And the man said unto him: We 
do not a believe that thou knowest 
any such thing. We do not believe 
in these foolish traditions. We do 
not  believe  that  thou  knowest  of 
things to come, neither do we be-
lieve that thy fathers and also that 
our  fathers  did  know  concerning 
the things which they spake, of that 
which is to come.

9 Now  Aaron  began  to  open  the 
a scriptures  unto  them  concern-
ing the coming of Christ, and also 
concerning the resurrection of the 
dead, and that there could be  b no 
redemption  for  mankind  c save  it 

were through the d death and suffer-
ings of Christ, and the atonement of  
his blood.

10 And it came to pass as he began 
to expound these things unto them 
they were angry with him, and be-
gan to a mock him; and they would 
not hear the words which he spake.
11 Therefore,  when  he  saw  that 
they would not hear his words, he 
departed  out  of  their  synagogue, 
and came over to a village which 
was called Ani-Anti, and there he 
found Muloki preaching the word 
unto  them;  and  also  Ammah  and 
his brethren. And they contended 
with many about the word.

12 And it came to pass that they 
saw that the people would harden 
their hearts, therefore they departed 
and  came  over  into  the  land  of 
a Middoni. And they did preach the 
word unto many, and b few believed 
on the words which they taught.

13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a cer-
tain number of his brethren were 
taken and cast into a prison, and the 
remainder of them fled out of the 
land of Middoni unto the regions 
round about.

14 And those who were cast into 
prison a suffered many things, and 
they  were  delivered  by  the  hand 
of Lamoni and Ammon, and they 
were fed and clothed.

15 And they went forth again to 
declare the word, and thus they were 
delivered for the first time out of 
prison; and thus they had suffered.
16 And they went forth whither-
soever they were led by the a Spirit 
of  the  Lord,  preaching  the  word 
of God in every synagogue of the 
Amalekites,  or  in  every  assembly 
of the Lamanites where they could 
be admitted.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the

Lord began to bless them, insomuch 
that  they  brought  many  to  the 
knowledge of the truth; yea, they  
did  a convince many of their sins, 
and of the traditions of their fathers, 
which were not correct.

18 And it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  Lamoni  returned  from 
the  land  of  Middoni  to  the  land  
of a Ishmael, which was the land of 
their inheritance.

19 And  king  Lamoni  would  not 
suffer  that  Ammon  should  serve 
him, or be his a servant.

20 But he caused that there should 
be  a synagogues  built  in  the  land 
of Ishmael; and he caused that his 
people,  or  the  people  who  were 
under  his  reign,  should  assemble 
themselves together.

21 And he did rejoice over them, 
and he did teach them many things. 
And he did also declare unto them 
that they were a people who were 
under  him,  and  that  they  were  a 
a free  people,  that  they  were  free 
from the oppressions of the king, 
his father; for that his father had 
granted  unto  him  that  he  might 
reign over the people who were in 
the land of Ishmael, and in all the 
land round about.

22 And he also declared unto them 
that  they  might  have  the  a liberty 
of worshiping the Lord their God 
according to their desires, in what-
soever place they were in, if it were 
in  the  land  which  was  under  the 
reign of king Lamoni.

23 And Ammon did preach unto 
the  people  of  king  Lamoni;  and 
it  came  to  pass  that  he  did  teach 
them all things concerning things 
pertaining  to  righteousness.  And 
he did exhort them daily, with all 
diligence; and they gave heed unto 
his word, and they were a zealous for 
keeping the commandments of God.

CHAPTER 22

Aaron teaches Lamoni’s father about 
the Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the 
plan  of  redemption  through  Christ—
The  king  and  all  his  household  are 
converted—The division of the land be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites 
is explained. About 90–77 b.c.
Now, as Ammon was thus teaching 
the people of Lamoni continually, 
we  will  return  to  the  account  of 
Aaron and his brethren; for after he 
departed from the land of Middoni 
he was a led by the Spirit to the land 
of Nephi, even to the house of the 
king which was b over all the land 
c save it were the land of Ishmael; 
and he was the father of Lamoni.

2 And it came to pass that he went 
in unto him into the king’s palace, 
with his brethren, and bowed him-
self before the king, and said unto 
him:  Behold,  O  king,  we  are  the 
brethren  of  Ammon,  whom  thou 
hast a delivered out of b prison.

3 And  now,  O  king,  if  thou  wilt 
spare  our  lives,  we  will  be  thy 
servants.  And  the  king  said  unto 
them:  Arise,  for  I  will  grant  unto 
you your lives, and I will not suffer 
that ye shall be my servants; but I 
will insist that ye shall administer 
unto me; for I have been somewhat 
a troubled  in  mind  because  of  the 
b generosity  and  the  greatness  of 
the words of thy brother Ammon; 
and I desire to know the cause why 
he has not come up out of Middoni  
with thee.

4 And Aaron said unto the king: 
Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has 
called him another way; he has gone 
a to the land of Ishmael, to teach the 
people of Lamoni.

5 Now  the  king  said  unto  them: 
What  is  this  that  ye  have  said  
concerning the Spirit of the Lord?

Behold, this is the thing which doth 
trouble me.

6 And also, what is this that Am-
mon said—a If ye will repent ye shall 
be saved, and if ye will not repent, 
ye shall be cast off at the last day ?
7 And  Aaron  answered  him  and 
said unto him: Believest thou that 
there is a God? And the king said: I 
know that the Amalekites say that 
there is a God, and I have granted 
unto them that they should build 
sanctuaries, that they may assem-
ble themselves together to worship 
him. And if now thou sayest there 
is a God, behold I will a believe.

8 And now when Aaron heard this, 
his heart began to rejoice, and he 
said: Behold, assuredly as thou liv-
est, O king, there is a God.

9 And the king said: Is God that 
a Great  Spirit  that  brought  our 
fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?
10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, 
he is that Great Spirit, and he a cre-
ated all things both in heaven and 
in earth. Believest thou this?

11 And he said: Yea, I believe that 
the Great Spirit created all things, 
and I desire that ye should tell me 
concerning all these things, and I 
will a believe thy words.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Aaron  saw  that  the  king  would 
believe his words, he began from 
the creation of Adam, a reading the 
scriptures unto the king—how God 
b created man after his own image, 
and that God gave him command-
ments, and that because of trans-
gression, man had fallen.

13 And Aaron did expound unto 
him  the  scriptures  from  the  a cre-
ation of Adam, laying the fall of man  

before him, and their carnal state 
and also the b plan of c redemption, 
which was prepared d from the foun-
dation of the world, through Christ, 
for all whosoever would believe on 
his name.

14 And since man had a fallen he 
could not b merit anything of him-
self; but the sufferings and c death 
of  Christ  d atone  for  their  sins, 
through faith and repentance, and 
so forth; and that he breaketh the 
bands of death, that the e grave shall 
have no victory, and that the sting 
of  death  should  be  swallowed  up 
in  the  hopes  of  glory;  and  Aaron 
did expound all these things unto  
the king.

15 And it came to pass that after 
Aaron had expounded these things 
unto him, the king said: a What shall 
I do that I may have this eternal life 
of  which  thou  hast  spoken?  Yea, 
what shall I do that I may be b born 
of  God,  having  this  wicked  spirit 
c rooted out of my breast, and receive 
his Spirit, that I may be filled with 
joy, that I may not be cast off at the 
last day ? Behold, said he, I will give 
up d all that I possess, yea, I will for-
sake my kingdom, that I may receive  
this great joy.

16 But  Aaron  said  unto  him:  If 
thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt 
a bow down before God, yea, if thou 
wilt repent of all thy sins, and will 
bow down before God, and call on 
his name in faith, believing that ye 
shall receive, then shalt thou receive 
the b hope which thou desirest.

17 And it came to pass that when 
Aaron  had  said  these  words,  the 
king did a bow down before the Lord, 
upon  his  knees;  yea,  even  he  did

prostrate himself upon the earth, 
and cried b mightily, saying:

18 O God, Aaron hath told me that 
there is a God; and if there is a God, 
and if thou art God, wilt thou make 
thyself known unto me, and I will 
give away all my sins to know thee, 
and that I may be raised from the 
dead, and be saved at the last day. 
And now when the king had said 
these words, he was struck a as if he 
were dead.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
servants ran and told the queen all 
that had happened unto the king. 
And she came in unto the king; and  
when she saw him lay as if he were 
dead, and also Aaron and his breth-
ren  standing  as  though  they  had 
been the cause of his fall, she was 
angry with them, and commanded 
that  her  servants,  or  the  servants 
of the king, should take them and 
slay them.

20 Now the servants had seen the 
cause  of  the  king’s  fall,  therefore 
they durst not lay their hands on 
Aaron and his brethren; and they 
pled with the queen saying: Why 
commandest thou that we should 
slay these men, when behold one 
of  them  is  a mightier  than  us  all? 
Therefore we shall fall before them.
21 Now when the queen saw the 
fear  of  the  servants  she  also  be-
gan to fear exceedingly, lest there 
should  some  evil  come  upon  her. 
And she commanded her servants 
that  they  should  go  and  call  the 
people, that they might slay Aaron 
and his brethren.

22 Now when Aaron saw the de-
termination of the queen, he, also 
knowing the hardness of the hearts 
of  the  people,  feared  lest  that  a 
multitude should assemble them-
selves  together,  and  there  should 
be a great contention and a distur-
bance  among  them;  therefore  he 

put forth his a hand and raised the 
king from the earth, and said unto 
him: Stand. And he stood upon his 
feet, receiving his strength.

23 Now this was done in the pres-
ence of the queen and many of the 
servants.  And  when  they  saw  it 
they greatly marveled, and began 
to fear. And the king stood forth, 
and began to a minister unto them. 
And he did minister unto them, in-
somuch that his b whole household 
were c converted unto the Lord.

24 Now  there  was  a  multitude 
gathered  together  because  of  the 
commandment  of  the  queen,  and 
there  began  to  be  great  murmur-
ings among them because of Aaron 
and his brethren.

25 But the king stood forth among 
them and administered unto them. 
And  they  were  a pacified  towards 
Aaron and those who were with him.
26 And it came to pass that when 
the king saw that the people were 
pacified, he caused that Aaron and 
his brethren should stand forth in the  
midst of the multitude, and that they 
should preach the word unto them.
27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king sent a a proclamation through-
out  all  the  land,  amongst  all  his 
people  who  were  in  all  his  land, 
who were in all the regions round 
about,  which  was  bordering  even 
to the sea, on the east and on the 
b west, and which was divided from 
the land of  c Zarahemla by a narrow 
strip of wilderness, which ran from 
the  sea  east  even  to  the  sea  west, 
and round about on the borders of 
the seashore, and the borders of the 
wilderness which was on the north 
by the land of Zarahemla, through 
the borders of d Manti, by the head 
of the  e river Sidon, running from 
the  east  towards  the  west—and 
thus  were  the  Lamanites  and  the  
Nephites divided.

28 Now, the more a idle part of the 
Lamanites lived in the wilderness, 
and dwelt in tents; and they were 
spread through the wilderness on 
the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, 
and also on the west of the land of 
Zarahemla,  in  the  borders  by  the 
seashore,  and  on  the  west  in  the 
land of Nephi, in the place of their 
fathers’ first inheritance, and thus 
bordering along by the seashore.

29 And also there were many La-
manites on the east by the seashore, 
whither  the  Nephites  had  driven 
them. And thus the Nephites were 
nearly surrounded by the Laman-
ites; nevertheless the Nephites had 
taken possession of all the north-
ern parts of the land bordering on 
the wilderness, at the head of the 
river  Sidon,  from  the  east  to  the 
west,  round  about  on  the  wilder-
ness side; on the north, even until 
they came to the land which they 
called a Bountiful.

30 And  it  bordered  upon  the 
land  which  they  called  a Desola-
tion, it being so far northward that 
it  came  into  the  land  which  had 
been peopled and been destroyed, 
of  whose  b bones  we  have  spoken, 
which was discovered by the c peo-
ple of Zarahemla, it being the place 
of their d first landing.

31 And they came from there a up 
into the south wilderness. Thus the 
b land on the northward was called 
c Desolation,  and  the  land  on  the 
southward  was  called  Bountiful, 
it  being  the  wilderness  which  is 
filled with all manner of wild ani-
mals of every kind, a part of which 
had come from the land northward  
for food.

32 And now, it was only the a dis-
tance of a day and a half’s journey 
for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful 
and the land Desolation, from the 
east to the west sea; and thus the 

land of Nephi and the land of Zara-
hemla were nearly surrounded by 
water, there being a small b neck of 
land between the land northward 
and the land southward.

33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  had  inhabited  the  land 
Bountiful, even from the east unto 
the west sea, and thus the Nephites 
in their wisdom, with their guards 
and their armies, had hemmed in 
the  Lamanites  on  the  south,  that 
thereby they should have no more 
possession on the north, that they 
might not overrun the land north-
ward.

34 Therefore the Lamanites could 
have no more possessions only in  
the land of Nephi, and the wilder-
ness  round  about.  Now  this  was 
wisdom  in  the  Nephites—as  the  
Lamanites were an enemy to them, 
they would not suffer their afflictions  
on every hand, and also that they 
might  have  a  country  whither 
they might flee, according to their  
desires.

35 And  now  I,  after  having  said 
this,  return  again  to  the  account 
of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and 
Himni, and their brethren.

CHAPTER 23
Religious freedom is proclaimed—The 
Lamanites  in  seven  lands  and  cities 
are  converted—They  call  themselves 
Anti-Nephi-Lehies and are freed from 
the  curse—The  Amalekites  and  the 
Amulonites  reject  the  truth.  About  
90–77 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that 
the  king  of  the  Lamanites  sent  a 
a proclamation among all his people, 
that they should not lay their hands 
on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or 
Himni, nor either of their brethren 
who should go forth preaching the 
word of God, in whatsoever place

they should be, in any part of their 
land.

2 Yea,  he  sent  a  decree  among 
them, that they should not lay their 
hands  on  them  to  bind  them,  or 
to  cast  them  into  prison;  neither 
should  they  spit  upon  them,  nor 
smite  them,  nor  cast  them  out  of 
their a synagogues, nor scourge them; 
neither should they cast stones at 
them,  but  that  they  should  have 
free access to their houses, and also 
their temples, and their b sanctuaries.
3 And  thus  they  might  go  forth 
and preach the word according to 
their desires, for the king had been 
converted unto the Lord, and  a all 
his  b household;  therefore  he  sent  
his  proclamation  throughout  the 
land unto his people, that the word 
of God might have no obstruction, 
but that it might go forth through-
out  all  the  land,  that  his  people 
might  be  convinced  concerning  
the  wicked  c traditions  of  their 
fathers, and that they might be con-
vinced that they were all brethren, 
and that they ought not to murder, 
nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to 
commit  adultery,  nor  to  commit 
any manner of wickedness.

4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when the king had sent forth this 
proclamation, that Aaron and his 
brethren went forth from  a city to 
city, and from one house of worship 
to another, establishing churches, 
and consecrating b priests and teach-
ers throughout the land among the 
Lamanites, to preach and to teach 
the  word  of  God  among  them; 
and thus they began to have great  
success.

5 And  a thousands  were  brought 
to  the  knowledge  of  the  Lord, 
yea,  thousands  were  brought  to 

believe  in  the  b traditions  of  the 
Nephites; and they were taught the 
c records and prophecies which were 
handed down even to the present  
time.

6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so  
sure as many as believed, or as many 
as were brought to the knowledge of  
the  truth,  through  the  preaching  
of Ammon and his brethren, accord-
ing to the spirit of revelation and 
of prophecy, and the power of God 
working a miracles in them—yea, I 
say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as 
many of the Lamanites as believed 
in their preaching, and were b con-
verted  unto  the  Lord,  c never  did 
fall away.

7 For they became a righteous peo-
ple; they did lay down the weapons 
of their rebellion, that they did not 
fight against God any more, neither 
against any of their brethren.

8 Now, these are  a they who were 

converted unto the Lord:

9 The  people  of  the  Lamanites 

who were in the land of Ishmael;

10 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites  who  were  in  the  land 
of a Middoni;

11 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites who were in the city of 
Nephi;

12 And also of the people of the 
Lamanites who were in the land of 
a Shilom, and who were in the land 
of Shemlon, and in the city of Lem-
uel, and in the city of Shimnilom.
13 And these are the names of the 
cities of the Lamanites which were 
a converted unto the Lord; and these 
are they that laid down the weap-
ons of their rebellion, yea, all their 
weapons of war; and they were all 
Lamanites.

14 And the Amalekites were not

a converted, save only one; neither 
were any of the b Amulonites; but they  
did  harden  their  hearts,  and  also 
the hearts of the Lamanites in that 
part of the land wheresoever they 
dwelt, yea, and all their villages and  
all their cities.

15 Therefore, we have named all 
the cities of the Lamanites in which 
they  did  repent  and  come  to  the 
knowledge of the truth, and were 
converted.

16 And now it came to pass that the 
king and those who were converted 
were desirous that they might have 
a name, that thereby they might be 
distinguished from their brethren; 
therefore the king consulted with 
Aaron and many of their priests, con-
cerning the name that they should 
take  upon  them,  that  they  might  
be distinguished.

17 And it came to pass that they 
called  their  names  a Anti-Nephi-
Lehies;  and  they  were  called  by 
this name and were no more called 
b Lamanites.

18 And  they  began  to  be  a  very 
a industrious people; yea, and they 
were  friendly  with  the  Nephites; 
therefore, they did  b open a corre-
spondence with them, and the c curse 
of God did no more follow them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lamanites come against the people 
of God—The Anti-Nephi-Lehies rejoice 
in Christ and are visited by angels—
They choose to suffer death rather than 
to defend themselves—More Lamanites 
are converted. About 90–77 b.c.
And it came to pass that the Amale-
kites and the Amulonites and the 
Lamanites  who  were  in  the  land  
of a Amulon, and also in the land of 
b Helam, and who were in the land 
of c Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the 

land round about, who had not been 
converted and had not taken upon 
them the name of d Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
were stirred up by the Amalekites 
and  by  the  Amulonites  to  anger 
against their brethren.

2 And  their  hatred  became  ex-
ceedingly sore against them, even 
insomuch that they began to rebel 
against their king, insomuch that 
they would not that he should be 
their king; therefore, they took up 
arms  against  the  people  of  Anti-
Nephi-Lehi.

3 Now the king conferred the king-
dom upon his son, and he called his 
name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

4 And the king died in that self-
same year that the Lamanites be-
gan to make preparations for war 
against the people of God.

5 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren and all those who had come up 
with him saw the preparations of 
the Lamanites to destroy their breth-
ren, they came forth to the land of 
Midian, and there Ammon met all 
his brethren; and from thence they 
came  to  the  land  of  Ishmael  that 
they  might  hold  a  a council  with 
Lamoni and also with his brother 
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should 
do to defend themselves against the 
Lamanites.

6 Now  there  was  not  one  soul 
among all the people who had been 
converted unto the Lord that would 
take up arms against their brethren; 
nay, they would not even make any 
preparations for war; yea, and also 
their king commanded them that 
they should not.

7 Now, these are the words which 
he  said  unto  the  people  concern-
ing  the  matter:  I  thank  my  God, 
my beloved people, that our great 
God has in goodness sent these our 
brethren, the Nephites, unto us to

preach unto us, and to convince us of  
the a traditions of our wicked fathers.
8 And  behold,  I  thank  my  great 
God that he has given us a portion 
of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that 
we have a opened a correspondence 
with these brethren, the Nephites.
9 And behold, I also thank my God, 
that  by  opening  this  correspon-
dence we have been convinced of 
our a sins, and of the many murders 
which we have committed.

10 And I also thank my God, yea, 
my great God, that he hath granted 
unto  us  that  we  might  repent  of 
these things, and also that he hath 
a forgiven us of those our many sins 
and murders which we have com-
mitted, and taken away the b guilt 
from our hearts, through the mer-
its of his Son.

11 And now behold, my brethren, 
since it has been all that we could 
do (as we were the most lost of all 
mankind) to repent of all our sins 
and the many murders which we 
have committed, and to get God to 
a take them away from our hearts, 
for it was all we could do to repent 
sufficiently  before  God  that  he 
would take away our stain—

12 Now,  my  best  beloved  breth-
ren,  since  God  hath  taken  away 
our stains, and our swords have be-
come bright, then let us stain our 
swords no more with the blood of 
our brethren.

13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let 
us retain our swords that they be 
not stained with the blood of our 
brethren; for perhaps, if we should 
stain our swords a again they can no 
more  be  b washed  bright  through 
the blood of the Son of our great 
God,  which  shall  be  shed  for  the 
atonement of our sins.

14 And  the  great  God  has  had 
mercy on us, and made these things 

known unto us that we might not 
perish; yea, and he has made these 
things known unto us beforehand, 
because he loveth our a souls as well 
as he loveth our children; therefore, 
in his mercy he doth visit us by his 
angels, that the b plan of salvation 
might be made known unto us as 
well as unto future generations.

15 Oh, how merciful is our God! 
And now behold, since it has been 
as much as we could do to get our 
stains taken away from us, and our 
swords are made bright, let us a hide 
them away that they may be kept 
bright, as a testimony to our God at  
the last day, or at the day that we 
shall  be  brought  to  stand  before 
him to be judged, that we have not 
stained our swords in the blood of 
our  brethren  since  he  imparted 
his word unto us and has made us 
b clean thereby.

16 And now, my brethren, if our 
brethren seek to destroy us, behold, 
we will hide away our swords, yea, 
even we will bury them deep in the 
earth, that they may be kept bright, 
as a testimony that we have never 
used them, at the last day; and if 
our  brethren  destroy  us,  behold, 
we shall  a go to our God and shall  
be saved.

17 And now it came to pass that 
when the king had made an end of 
these  sayings,  and  all  the  people 
were assembled together, they took 
their swords, and all the weapons 
which were used for the shedding 
of man’s blood, and they did a bury 
them up deep in the earth.

18 And this they did, it being in 
their view a testimony to God, and 
also to men, that they a never would 
use weapons again for the shedding 
of man’s blood; and this they did, 
vouching  and  b covenanting  with 
God,  that  rather  than  shed  the

blood of their brethren they would 
c give up their own lives; and rather 
than take away from a brother they 
would  give  unto  him;  and  rather 
than spend their days in idleness 
they would labor abundantly with 
their hands.

19 And  thus  we  see  that,  when 
these  Lamanites  were  brought  to 
a believe and to know the truth, they  
were b firm, and would suffer even 
unto death rather than commit sin; 
and  thus  we  see  that  they  buried 
their weapons of peace, or they bur-
ied the weapons of war, for peace.
20 And it came to pass that their 
brethren, the Lamanites, made pre-
parations for war, and came up to 
the land of Nephi for the purpose 
of destroying the king, and to place 
a another  in  his  stead,  and  also  of  
destroying  the  people  of  Anti-
Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

21 Now when the people saw that 
they were coming against them they 
went out to meet them, and a pros-
trated themselves before them to the 
earth, and began to call on the name 
of  the  Lord;  and  thus  they  were 
in this attitude when the Laman-
ites began to fall upon them, and  
began to slay them with the sword.
22 And thus without meeting any 
resistance, they did slay a a thousand 
and five of them; and we know that 
they are blessed, for they have gone 
to dwell with their God.

23 Now when the Lamanites saw 
that their brethren would not flee 
from the sword, neither would they 
turn aside to the right hand or to the 
left, but that they would lie down 
and a perish, and b praised God even 
in the very act of perishing under 
the sword—

24 Now when the Lamanites saw 

this they did a forbear from slaying 
them; and there were many whose 
hearts had b swollen in them for those  
of  their  brethren  who  had  fallen 
under the sword, for they repented 
of the things which they had done.
25 And it came to pass that they 
threw down their weapons of war, 
and  they  would  not  take  them  
again, for they were stung for the 
murders which they had committed; 
and they came down even as their 
brethren, relying upon the mercies 
of those whose arms were lifted to  
slay them.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people of God were joined that day 
by more than the number who had 
been slain; and those who had been 
slain were righteous people, there-
fore we have no reason to doubt but 
what they were a saved.

27 And there was not a wicked man 
slain among them; but there were 
more than a thousand brought to 
the knowledge of the truth; thus we 
see that the Lord worketh in many 
a ways to the salvation of his people.
28 Now  the  greatest  number  of 
those of the Lamanites who slew so 
many of their brethren were Amale-
kites and Amulonites, the greatest 
number  of  whom  were  after  the 
a order of the b Nehors.

29 Now, among those who joined 
the people of the Lord, there were 
a none who were Amalekites or Amu-
lonites, or who were of the order of  
Nehor, but they were actual descen-
dants of Laman and Lemuel.

30 And  thus  we  can  plainly  dis-
cern, that after a people have been 
once a enlightened by the b Spirit of 
God, and have had great c knowledge 
of things pertaining to righteous-
ness, and then have d fallen away into

Lamanite  aggressions  spread—The 
seed  of  the  priests  of  Noah  perish  as 
Abinadi  prophesied—Many  Laman-
ites are converted and join the people 
of  Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They  believe  in 
Christ and keep the law of Moses. About  
90–77 b.c.
And  behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  those  Lamanites  were  more 
angry because they had slain their 
brethren;  therefore  they  swore 
vengeance upon the Nephites; and 
they did a no more attempt to slay 
the people of  b Anti-Nephi-Lehi at  
that time.

2 But they took their armies and 
went over into the borders of the 
land of Zarahemla, and fell upon 
the people who were in the land of 
Ammonihah and a destroyed them.
3 And after that, they had a many 
battles  with  the  Nephites,  in  the 
which they were driven and slain.
4 And among the Lamanites who 
were slain were almost all the a seed 
of Amulon and his brethren, who 
were the priests of Noah, and they 
were  slain  by  the  hands  of  the 
Nephites;

5 And the remainder, having fled 
into the east wilderness, and hav-
ing  usurped  the  power  and  a au-
thority over the Lamanites, caused 
that many of the Lamanites should 
b perish  by  fire  because  of  their  
belief—

6 For many of  a them, after having 
suffered  much  loss  and  so  many 
afflictions,  began  to  be  stirred 
up in remembrance of the b words 
which Aaron and his brethren had 

preached  to  them  in  their  land; 
therefore they began to disbelieve 
the c traditions of their fathers, and 
to believe in the Lord, and that he 
gave great power unto the Nephites; 
and thus there were many of them 
converted in the wilderness.

7 And it came to pass that those 
rulers  who  were  the  remnant  of 
the  children  of  a Amulon  caused 
that they should be put to b death, 
yea, all those that believed in these  
things.

8 Now this martyrdom caused that 
many of their brethren should be 
stirred up to anger; and there began 
to be contention in the wilderness; 
and the Lamanites began to a hunt 
the seed of Amulon and his breth-
ren  and  began  to  slay  them;  and 
they fled into the east wilderness.
9 And behold they are hunted at 
this  day  by  the  Lamanites.  Thus 
the words of Abinadi were brought 
to pass, which he said concerning 
the seed of the priests who caused 
that he should suffer death by fire.
10 For he said unto them: What ye 
shall  a do unto me shall be a type 
of things to come.

11 And now Abinadi was the first 
that suffered a death by fire because 
of  his  belief  in  God;  now  this  is 
what he meant, that many should 
suffer death by fire, according as 
he had suffered.

12 And he said unto the priests of 
Noah that their seed should cause 
many  to  be  put  to  death,  in  the 
like  manner  as  he  was,  and  that 
they  should  be  scattered  abroad 
and slain, even as a sheep having 
no shepherd is driven and slain by 
wild beasts; and now behold, these 
words were verified, for they were 
driven by the Lamanites, and they 
were hunted, and they were smitten.
13 And it came to pass that when

the Lamanites saw that they could 
not overpower the Nephites they re-
turned again to their own land; and 
many of them came over to dwell in 
the land of a Ishmael and the land 
of Nephi, and did join themselves 
to the people of God, who were the 
people of b Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

14 And they did also a bury their 
weapons of war, according as their 
brethren had, and they began to be 
a  righteous  people;  and  they  did 
walk in the ways of the Lord, and 
did observe to keep his command-
ments and his statutes.

15 Yea, and they did keep the law 
of Moses; for it was expedient that 
they should keep the law of Moses 
as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But 
notwithstanding the a law of Moses,  
they did look forward to the coming 
of Christ, considering that the law 
of Moses was a b type of his coming, 
and believing that they must keep 
those c outward d performances until 
the time that he should be revealed 
unto them.

16 Now  they  did  not  suppose 
that  a salvation  came  by  the  b law 
of Moses; but the law of Moses did 
serve  to  strengthen  their  faith  in 
Christ; and thus they did retain a 
c hope  through  faith,  unto  eternal 
salvation,  relying  upon  the  spirit 
of prophecy, which spake of those 
things to come.

17 And now behold, Ammon, and 
Aaron,  and  Omner,  and  Himni, 
and their brethren did rejoice ex-
ceedingly,  for  the  success  which 
they  had  had  among  the  Laman-
ites,  seeing  that  the  Lord  had 
granted  unto  them  according  to 
their a prayers, and that he had also  

verified his word unto them in every  
particular.

CHAPTER 26

Ammon  glories  in  the  Lord—The  
faithful  are  strengthened  by  the  Lord 
and  are  given  knowledge—By  faith  
men  may  bring  thousands  of  souls  
unto  repentance—God  has  all  power 
and  comprehends  all  things.  About 
90–77 b.c.
And  now,  these  are  the  words  of 
Ammon to his brethren, which say 
thus: My brothers and my brethren, 
behold  I  say  unto  you,  how  great 
reason have we to rejoice; for could 
we have supposed when we a started 
from  the  land  of  Zarahemla  that 
God  would  have  granted  unto  us 
such great blessings?

2 And now, I ask, what great bless-
ings has he bestowed upon us? Can 
ye tell?

3 Behold,  I  answer  for  you;  for 
our brethren, the Lamanites, were 
in darkness, yea, even in the dark-
est abyss, but behold, how  a many 
of them are brought to behold the 
marvelous light of God! And this is 
the blessing which hath been be-
stowed upon us, that we have been 
made  b instruments  in  the  hands 
of  God  to  bring  about  this  great  
work.

4 Behold, a thousands of them do 
rejoice, and have been brought into 
the fold of God.

5 Behold, the a field was ripe, and 
blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in 
the b sickle, and did reap with your 
might, yea, all the day long did ye 
labor;  and  behold  the  number  of 
your  c sheaves!  And  they  shall  be

gathered into the garners, that they 
are not wasted.

6 Yea,  they  shall  not  be  beaten 
down by the storm at the last day; 
yea, neither shall they be harrowed 
up by the whirlwinds; but when the 
a storm cometh they shall be gath-
ered  together  in  their  place,  that 
the storm cannot penetrate to them; 
yea,  neither  shall  they  be  driven 
with  fierce  winds  whithersoever 
the enemy listeth to carry them.

7 But behold, they are in the hands 
of the Lord of the a harvest, and they 
are his; and he will b raise them up 
at the last day.

8 a Blessed be the name of our God; 
let us b sing to his praise, yea, let us 
give c thanks to his holy name, for 
he doth work righteousness forever.
9 For if we had not come up out 
of  the  land  of  Zarahemla,  these 
our dearly beloved brethren, who 
have  so  dearly  beloved  us,  would 
still have been racked with a hatred 
against us, yea, and they would also 
have been b strangers to God.

10 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon had said these words, his 
brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: 
Ammon,  I  fear  that  thy  joy  doth 
carry thee away unto boasting.

11 But  Ammon  said  unto  him:  I 
do not a boast in my own strength, 
nor in my own wisdom; but behold, 
my  b joy  is  full,  yea,  my  heart  is 
brim with c joy, and I will rejoice in  
my God.

12 Yea,  I  know  that  I  am  a noth-
ing; as to my strength I am weak; 
therefore I will b not boast of myself, 
but I will c boast of my God, for in 

his  d strength  I  can  do  all  e things; 
yea,  behold,  many  mighty  mira-
cles we have wrought in this land, 
for which we will praise his name  
forever.

13 Behold, how many thousands of 
our brethren has he loosed from the 
pains of a hell; and they are brought 
to  b sing  redeeming  love,  and  this 
because of the power of his word 
which is in us, therefore have we 
not great reason to rejoice?

14 Yea, we have reason to praise 
him forever, for he is the Most High 
God, and has loosed our brethren 
from the a chains of hell.

15 Yea, they were encircled about 
with  everlasting  a darkness  and 
destruction;  but  behold,  he  has 
brought them into his everlasting 
b light, yea, into everlasting salvation; 
and they are encircled about with 
the  matchless  bounty  of  his  love; 
yea, and we have been instruments 
in  his  hands  of  doing  this  great  
and marvelous work.

16 Therefore,  let  us  a glory,  yea, 
we will b glory in the Lord; yea, we 
will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, 
we will praise our God forever. Be-
hold, who can glory too much in the 
Lord? Yea, who can say too much of 
his great power, and of his c mercy, 
and of his long-suffering towards 
the children of men? Behold, I say 
unto you, I cannot say the smallest 
part which I feel.

17 Who could have supposed that 
our God would have been so merci-
ful as to have snatched us from our 
awful, sinful, and a polluted state?

wrath, with mighty threatenings to 
a destroy his church.

19 Oh then, why did he not con-
sign us to an awful destruction, yea, 
why did he not let the sword of his 
justice fall upon us, and doom us 
to eternal a despair?

20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, 
fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did 
not exercise his justice upon us, but 
in his great mercy hath brought us 
over that everlasting a gulf of death 
and  misery,  even  to  the  salvation 
of our souls.

21 And now behold, my brethren, 
what  a natural  man  is  there  that 
knoweth  these  things?  I  say  unto 
you, there is  b none that  c knoweth 
these things, save it be the penitent.
22 Yea, he that a repenteth and ex-
erciseth  faith, and  bringeth  forth 
good  b works,  and  prayeth  contin-
ually  without  ceasing—unto  such 
it is given to know the  c mysteries 
of God; yea, unto such it shall be 
d given to e reveal things which never 
have  been  revealed;  yea,  and  it 
shall be given unto such to bring 
thousands  of  souls  to  repentance, 
even  as  it  has  been  given  unto 
us  to  bring  these  our  brethren  to  
repentance.

23 Now do ye remember, my breth-
ren, that we said unto our brethren 
in the land of Zarahemla, we go up 
to the land of Nephi, to preach unto 
our  brethren,  the  Lamanites,  and 
they a laughed us to scorn?

24 For they said unto us: Do ye sup-
pose that ye can bring the Laman-
ites to the knowledge of the truth? 
Do ye suppose that ye can convince 
the Lamanites of the a incorrectness 
of the  b traditions of their fathers, 

as c stiffnecked a people as they are; 
whose hearts delight in the d shed-
ding  of  blood;  whose  days  have 
been spent in the grossest iniquity; 
whose ways have been the ways of 
a transgressor from the beginning? 
Now my brethren, ye remember that 
this was their language.

25 And moreover they did say: Let 
us take up arms against them, that 
we destroy them and their iniquity 
out of the land, lest they overrun 
us and destroy us.

26 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren,  we  came  into  the  wilderness 
not with the intent to destroy our 
brethren, but with the intent that 
perhaps  we  might  save  some  few 
of their souls.

27 Now when our hearts were de-
pressed, and we were about to a turn 
back, behold, the Lord b comforted 
us, and said: Go amongst thy breth-
ren, the Lamanites, and bear with 
c patience  thine  d afflictions,  and  I 
will give unto you success.

28 And now behold, we have come, 
and been forth amongst them; and 
we have been patient in our suffer-
ings, and we have suffered every pri-
vation; yea, we have traveled from  
house  to  house,  relying  upon  the 
mercies  of  the  world—not  upon 
the mercies of the world alone but 
upon the mercies of God.

29 And we have entered into their 
houses  and  taught  them,  and  we 
have taught them in their streets; 
yea, and we have taught them upon 
their hills; and we have also entered 
into their temples and their a syna-
gogues  and  taught  them;  and  we 
have  been  cast  out,  and  mocked, 
and spit upon, and smote upon our

cheeks; and we have been b stoned, 
and taken and bound with c strong 
cords,  and  cast  into  prison;  and 
through the power and wisdom of 
God we have been delivered again.
30 And we have suffered all manner  
of afflictions, and all this, that per-
haps we might be the means of sav-
ing some soul; and we supposed that 
our a joy would be full if perhaps we 
could be the means of saving some.
31 Now behold, we can look forth 
and see the a fruits of our labors; and 
are they few? I say unto you, Nay, 
they  are  b many;  yea,  and  we  can 
witness of their sincerity, because 
of their love towards their brethren 
and also towards us.

32 For  behold,  they  had  rather 
a sacrifice  their  lives  than  even  to 
take  the  life  of  their  enemy;  and 
they have b buried their weapons of 
war deep in the earth, because of 
their love towards their brethren.

33 And now behold I say unto you, 
has there been so great love in all 
the  land?  Behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
Nay, there has not, even among the 
Nephites.

34 For  behold,  they  would  take 
up  arms  against  their  brethren; 
they  would  not  suffer  themselves 
to be slain. But behold how a many 
of these have laid down their lives; 
and we know that they have gone 
to their God, because of their love 
and of their hatred to sin.

35 Now  have  we  not  reason  to 
rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there 
never were men that had so great 
reason  to  rejoice  as  we,  since  the 
world  began;  yea,  and  my  joy  is 
carried  away,  even  unto  boasting 
in my God; for he has all  a power, 
b all wisdom, and all understanding; 
he comprehendeth all things, and 

he is a c merciful Being, even unto 
salvation, to those who will repent 
and believe on his name.

36 Now if this is a boasting, even so 
will I boast; for this is my life and 
my light, my joy and my salvation, 
and my redemption from everlast-
ing  wo.  Yea,  blessed  is  the  name  
of my God, who has been mindful of  
this people, who are a b branch of the  
tree  of  Israel,  and  has  been  c lost 
from its body in a strange land; yea,  
I  say,  blessed  be  the  name  of  my 
God, who has been mindful of us, 
d wanderers in a strange land.

37 Now my brethren, we see that 
God is  a mindful of every  b people, 
whatsoever  land  they  may  be  in; 
yea, he numbereth his people, and 
his bowels of mercy are over all the 
earth. Now this is my joy, and my 
great thanksgiving; yea, and I will 
give thanks unto my God forever. 
Amen.

CHAPTER 27
The Lord commands Ammon to lead 
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—
Upon  meeting  Alma,  Ammon’s  joy 
exhausts  his  strength—The  Nephites 
give the Anti-Nephi-Lehies the land of 
Jershon—They are called the people of 
Ammon. About 90–77 b.c.
Now  it  came  to  pass  that  when 
those  Lamanites  who  had  gone 
to  war  against  the  Nephites  had 
found, after their a many struggles 
to destroy them, that it was in vain 
to seek their destruction, they re-
turned again to the land of Nephi.
2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Amalekites,  because  of  their  loss, 
were exceedingly angry. And when 
they saw that they could not seek 
revenge from the Nephites, they be-
gan to a stir up the people in anger

against their b brethren, the people 
of c Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they 
began again to destroy them.

3 Now this people a again refused to 
take their arms, and they suffered 
themselves to be slain according to 
the desires of their enemies.

4 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren  saw  this  work  of  destruction 
among those whom they so dearly 
beloved, and among those who had 
so  dearly  beloved  them—for  they 
were treated as though they were 
angels sent from God to save them 
from  everlasting  destruction— 
therefore,  when  Ammon  and  his 
brethren  saw  this  great  work  of 
destruction, they were moved with 
compassion,  and  they  a said  unto  
the king:

5 Let us gather together this peo-
ple of the Lord, and let us go down 
to  the  land  of  Zarahemla  to  our 
brethren the Nephites, and flee out 
of the hands of our enemies, that 
we be not destroyed.

6 But the king said unto them: Be-
hold, the Nephites will destroy us, 
because of the many murders and 
sins  we  have  committed  against 
them.

7 And Ammon said: I will go and 
inquire of the Lord, and if he say 
unto us, go down unto our breth-
ren, will ye go?

8 And the king said unto him: Yea, 
if the Lord saith unto us go, we will 
go  down  unto  our  brethren,  and 
we will be their slaves until we re-
pair unto them the many murders 
and sins which we have committed 
against them.

9 But  Ammon  said  unto  him:  It 
is against the law of our brethren, 
which was established by my father, 
that  there  should  be  any  a slaves 
among  them;  therefore  let  us  go 
down  and  rely  upon  the  mercies 
of our brethren.

10 But the king said unto him: In-
quire of the Lord, and if he saith 
unto  us  go,  we  will  go;  otherwise 
we will perish in the land.

11 And it came to pass that Am-
mon went and inquired of the Lord, 
and the Lord said unto him:

12 Get  this  people  a out  of  this 
land, that they perish not; for Sa-
tan has great hold on the hearts of 
the Amalekites, who do stir up the 
Lamanites  to  anger  against  their 
brethren to slay them; therefore get 
thee out of this land; and blessed 
are this people in this generation, 
for I will b preserve them.

13 And now it came to pass that 
Ammon went and told the king all 
the words which the Lord had said 
unto him.

14 And they gathered together all 
their people, yea, all the people of 
the Lord, and did gather together 
all their flocks and herds, and de-
parted  out  of  the  land,  and  came 
into the wilderness which divided 
the land of Nephi from the land of 
Zarahemla, and came over near the 
borders of the land.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon said unto them: Behold, I and 
my brethren will go forth into the 
land of Zarahemla, and ye shall re-
main here until we return; and we 
will a try the hearts of our brethren, 
whether they will that ye shall come 
into their land.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  as 
Ammon  was  going  forth  into  the 
land, that he and his brethren met 
Alma, over in the a place of which 
has been spoken; and behold, this 
was a joyful meeting.

17 Now  the  a joy  of  Ammon  was 
so great even that he was full; yea, 
he was swallowed up in the joy of 
his  God,  even  to  the  b exhausting 
of his strength; and he fell  c again 
to the earth.

18 Now  was  not  this  a exceed-
ing joy ? Behold, this is joy which 
none receiveth save it be the truly 
penitent  and  humble  seeker  of  
b happiness.

19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting 
his a brethren was truly great, and 
also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and 
Himni; but behold their joy was not 
that to exceed their strength.

20 And now it came to pass that 
Alma conducted his brethren back 
to the land of Zarahemla; even to 
his a own house. And they went and 
told the b chief judge all the things 
that  had  happened  unto  them  in 
the  land  of  Nephi,  among  their 
brethren, the Lamanites.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
chief  judge  sent  a  proclamation 
throughout  all  the  land,  desiring 
the  voice  of  the  people  concern-
ing  the  admitting  their  brethren, 
who  were  the  people  of  a Anti- 
Nephi-Lehi.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  people  came,  saying: 
Behold, we will give up the a land of 
b Jershon, which is on the east by the 
sea, which joins the land Bountiful, 
which is on the south of the land 
Bountiful; and this land Jershon is 
the land which we will give unto 
our brethren for an inheritance.

23 And  behold,  we  will  set  our 
armies  between  the  land  Jershon 
and the land Nephi, that we may 
a protect our brethren in the land 
Jershon;  and  this  we  do  for  our 
brethren,  on  account  of  their 
fear to take up arms against their 
brethren lest they should commit 
sin; and this their great fear came 
because  of  their  sore  repentance 
which they had, on account of their 
many  murders  and  their  awful  
wickedness.

24 And now behold, this will we 

do  unto  our  brethren,  that  they 
may inherit the land Jershon; and 
we will guard them from their en-
emies with our armies, on condition 
that they will give us a a portion of 
their substance to assist us that we 
may maintain our armies.

25 Now, it came to pass that when 
Ammon had heard this, he returned 
to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
and also Alma with him, into the 
wilderness, where they had pitched 
their tents, and made known unto 
them  all  these  things.  And  Alma 
also related unto them his a conver-
sion, with Ammon and Aaron, and 
his brethren.

26 And it came to pass that it did 
cause great joy among them. And 
they  went  down  into  the  land  of 
Jershon,  and  took  possession  of  
the land of Jershon; and they were 
called by the Nephites the a people 
of  Ammon;  therefore  they  were 
distinguished  by  that  name  ever  
after.

27 And they were among the peo-
ple  of  Nephi,  and  also  numbered 
among the people who were of the 
church of God. And they were also 
distinguished for their a zeal towards 
God, and also towards men; for they 
were perfectly b honest and upright 
in all things; and they were  c firm 
in  the  faith  of  Christ,  even  unto  
the end.

28 And they did look upon shed-
ding  the  blood  of  their  brethren 
with the greatest abhorrence; and 
they never could be prevailed upon 
to take up arms against their breth-
ren; and they never did look upon 
death with any degree of terror, for 
their hope and views of Christ and 
the  resurrection;  therefore,  death 
was swallowed up to them by the 
victory of Christ over it.

29 Therefore,  they  would  suffer

a death in the most aggravating and 
distressing manner which could be 
inflicted by their brethren, before 
they would take the sword or cime-
ter to smite them.

30 And thus they were a zealous 
and  beloved  people,  a  highly  fa-
vored people of the Lord.

CHAPTER 28
The Lamanites are defeated in a tre-
mendous  battle—Tens  of  thousands 
are  slain—The  wicked  are  consigned 
to a state of endless woe; the righteous 
attain a never-ending happiness. About 
77–76 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
the people of Ammon were estab-
lished in the land of a Jershon, and 
a  church  also  established  in  the 
land of Jershon, and the armies of 
the Nephites were set round about 
the land of Jershon, yea, in all the 
borders  round  about  the  land  of 
Zarahemla;  behold  the  armies  of 
the Lamanites had followed their 
brethren into the wilderness.

2 And  thus  there  was  a  tremen-
dous battle; yea, even such an one 
as  never  had  been  known  among 
all the people in the land from the 
time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and 
tens of thousands of the Lamanites 
were slain and scattered abroad.

3 Yea, and also there was a tremen-
dous slaughter among the people of 
Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites 
were a driven and scattered, and the 
people of Nephi returned again to 
their land.

4 And  now  this  was  a  time  that 
there  was  a  great  a mourning  and 
lamentation heard throughout all 
the land, among all the people of 
Nephi—

5 Yea, the cry of a widows mourn-
ing for their husbands, and also of 
fathers  mourning  for  their  sons, 

and the daughter for the brother, 
yea,  the  brother  for  the  father; 
and thus the cry of mourning was 
heard among all of them, mourn-
ing  for  their  kindred  who  had  
been slain.

6 And now surely this was a sor-
rowful  day;  yea,  a  time  of  solem-
nity, and a time of much  a fasting 
and prayer.

7 And  thus  endeth  the  fifteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi;

8 And a this is the account of Am-
mon and his brethren, their jour-
neyings in the land of Nephi, their 
sufferings in the land, their sorrows, 
and their afflictions, and their b in-
comprehensible joy, and the recep-
tion and safety of the brethren in 
the land of Jershon. And now may 
the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, 
bless their souls forever.

9 And  this  is  the  account  of  the 
wars  and  contentions  among  the 
Nephites, and also the wars between 
the  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites; 
and the fifteenth year of the reign 
of the judges is ended.

10 And from the a first year to the 
fifteenth  has  brought  to  pass  the 
destruction of many thousand lives; 
yea, it has brought to pass an awful 
scene of bloodshed.

11 And the bodies of many thou-
sands  are  laid  low  in  the  earth, 
while the bodies of many thousands 
are a moldering in heaps upon the 
face  of  the  earth;  yea,  and  many 
thousands  are  b mourning  for  the 
loss of their kindred, because they 
have reason to fear, according to the 
promises of the Lord, that they are 
consigned to a state of endless wo.
12 While many thousands of others 
truly  a mourn for the loss of their 
kindred, yet they rejoice and exult 
in the hope, and even know, accord-
ing to the b promises of the Lord, that

they are raised to dwell at the right 
hand  of  God,  in  a  state  of  never-
ending c happiness.

13 And  thus  we  see  how  great 
the  a inequality of man is because 
of sin and  b transgression, and the 
power  of  the  devil,  which  comes 
by  the  cunning  c plans  which  he 
hath devised to ensnare the hearts  
of men.

14 And thus we see the great call 
of a diligence of men to labor in the 
vineyards of the Lord; and thus we 
see the great reason of sorrow, and 
also  of  rejoicing—sorrow  because 
of  death  and  destruction  among 
men, and joy because of the b light 
of Christ unto life.

CHAPTER 29
Alma desires to cry repentance with an-
gelic zeal—The Lord grants teachers for 
all nations—Alma glories in the Lord’s 
work and in the success of Ammon and 
his brethren. About 76 b.c.
O that I were an angel, and could 
have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the 
a trump of God, with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto 
every people!

2 Yea, I would declare unto every 
soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance and the plan of redemp-
tion, that they should repent and 
a come  unto  our  God,  that  there 
might not be more sorrow upon all 
the face of the earth.

3 But behold, I am a man, and do 
sin  in  my  wish;  for  I  ought  to  be 
content with the things which the 
Lord hath allotted unto me.

4 I ought not to harrow up in my 
desires the firm decree of a just God,  

for I know that he granteth unto men  
according to their a desire, whether 
it be unto death or unto life; yea, 
I know that he allotteth unto men, 
yea,  decreeth  unto  them  decrees 
which are unalterable, according to 
their b wills, whether they be unto 
salvation or unto destruction.

5 Yea, and I know that good and 
evil have come before all men; he 
that knoweth not good from evil is 
a blameless;  but  he  that  b knoweth 
good and evil, to him it is given ac-
cording to his desires, whether he 
desireth good or evil, life or death, 
joy or remorse of c conscience.

6 Now,  seeing  that  I  know  these 
things,  why  should  I  desire  more 
than to a perform the work to which 
I have been called?

7 Why should I desire that I were 
an  angel,  that  I  could  speak  unto 
all the ends of the earth?

8 For behold, the Lord doth a grant 
unto b all nations, of their own na-
tion and c tongue, to teach his word, 
yea, in wisdom, all that he  d seeth 
fit that they should have; therefore 
we see that the Lord doth counsel 
in wisdom, according to that which 
is just and true.

9 I know that which the Lord hath 
commanded me, and I glory in it. 
I  do  a not  b glory  of  myself,  but  I 
glory in that which the Lord hath 
commanded  me;  yea,  and  this  is 
my glory, that perhaps I may be an 
instrument in the hands of God to 
bring some soul to repentance; and 
this is my joy.

10 And behold, when I see many 
of my brethren truly penitent, and 
coming to the Lord their God, then 
is my soul filled with joy; then do I 
remember a what the Lord has done

for me, yea, even that he hath heard 
my prayer; yea, then do I remem-
ber his merciful arm which he ex-
tended towards me.

11 Yea, and I also remember the 
captivity of my fathers; for I surely 
do know that the a Lord did deliver 
them out of bondage, and by this 
did  establish  his  church;  yea,  the 
Lord  God,  the  God  of  Abraham, 
the  God  of  Isaac,  and  the  God  of 
Jacob,  did  deliver  them  out  of  
bondage.

12 Yea, I have always remembered 
the captivity of my fathers; and that 
same God who a delivered them out 
of the hands of the Egyptians did 
deliver them out of b bondage.

13 Yea, and that same God did es-
tablish his church among them; yea, 
and that same God hath called me 
by  a  a holy  calling,  to  b preach  the 
word  unto  this  people,  and  hath 
given me much success, in the which 
my joy is full.

14 But  I  do  not  joy  in  my  own 
a success alone, but my joy is more 
full  because  of  the  success  of  my 
brethren, who have been up to the 
land of Nephi.

15 Behold, they have labored ex-
ceedingly, and have brought forth 
much fruit; and how great shall be 
their reward!

16 Now, when I think of the suc-
cess of these my brethren my soul 
is carried away, even to the separa-
tion of it from the body, as it were, 
so great is my a joy.

17 And now may God grant unto 
these, my brethren, that they may 
sit down in the kingdom of God; yea,  
and also all those who are the fruit 
of their labors that they may go no 
more out, but that they may praise 
him  forever.  And  may  God  grant 
that  it  may  be  done  according  to 
my words, even as I have spoken. 
Amen.

CHAPTER 30

Korihor, the anti-Christ, ridicules Christ,  
the Atonement, and the spirit of proph-
ecy—He teaches that there is no God, no 
fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no 
Christ—Alma testifies that Christ will 
come and that all things denote there is 
a God—Korihor demands a sign and is 
struck dumb—The devil had appeared 
to Korihor as an angel and taught him 
what to say—Korihor is trodden down 
and dies. About 76–74 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that 
after the  a people of Ammon were 
established in the land of Jershon, 
yea,  and  also  after  the  Lamanites 
were  b driven out of the land, and 
their dead were buried by the peo-
ple of the land—

2 Now  their  dead  were  not  num-
bered  because  of  the  greatness  of 
their numbers; neither were the dead 
of  the  Nephites  numbered—but  it 
came to pass after they had buried 
their dead, and also after the days of 
a fasting, and b mourning, and prayer, 
(and it was in the sixteenth year of 
the reign of the judges over the peo-
ple of Nephi) there began to be con-
tinual peace throughout all the land.
3 Yea, and the people did observe 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord;  and  they  were  strict  in  ob-
serving  the  a ordinances  of  God, 
according to the law of Moses; for 
they were taught to b keep the law 
of Moses until it should be fulfilled.
4 And  thus  the  people  did  have 
no disturbance in all the sixteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

5 And it came to pass that in the 
commencement of the seventeenth 
year of the reign of the judges, there 
was continual peace.

6 But it came to pass in the latter  
end of the seventeenth year, there 
came  a  man  into  the  land  of

Zarahemla, and he was a Anti-Christ, 
for he began to preach unto the peo-
ple b against the prophecies which 
had been spoken by the prophets, 
concerning the coming of Christ.

7 Now there was no law against a 
a man’s b belief; for it was strictly con-
trary to the commands of God that  
there should be a law which should 
bring men on to unequal grounds.
8 For  thus  saith  the  scripture: 
a Choose ye this day, whom ye will 
serve.

9 Now  if  a  man  desired  to  serve 
God, it was his privilege; or rather, 
if he believed in God it was his priv-
ilege to serve him; but if he did not 
believe in him there was no law to 
punish him.

10 But  if  he  a murdered  he  was 
punished  unto  b death;  and  if  he 
c robbed he was also punished; and 
if  he  stole  he  was  also  punished; 
and if he committed  d adultery he 
was also punished; yea, for all this 
wickedness they were punished.

11 For there was a law that men 
should be judged according to their 
crimes. Nevertheless, there was no 
law against a man’s belief; therefore, 
a man was punished only for the 
crimes which he had done; therefore 
all men were on a equal grounds.

12 And  this  a Anti-Christ,  whose 
name  was  Korihor,  (and  the  law 
could have no hold upon him) be-
gan to preach unto the people that 
there should be b no Christ. And after 
this manner did he preach, saying:
13 O ye that are bound down un-
der a a foolish and a vain hope, why 
do  ye  yoke  yourselves  with  such 
foolish things? Why do ye look for 
a Christ? For no man can b know of 
anything which is to come.

14 Behold, these things which ye 

call  prophecies,  which  ye  say  are 
handed  down  by  holy  prophets, 
behold, they are foolish traditions 
of your fathers.

15 How do ye know of their surety ? 
Behold, ye cannot know of things 
which ye do not a see; therefore ye 
cannot know that there shall be a 
Christ.

16 Ye  look  forward  and  say  that 
ye see a remission of your sins. But 
behold, it is the effect of a a frenzied 
mind; and this derangement of your 
minds comes because of the tradi-
tions  of  your  fathers,  which  lead 
you  away  into  a  belief  of  things 
which are not so.

17 And  many  more  such  things 
did he say unto them, telling them 
that there could be no atonement 
made for the sins of men, but every 
man a fared in this life according to 
the  management  of  the  creature; 
therefore  every  man  prospered 
according  to  his  genius,  and  that 
every  man  conquered  according 
to his strength; and b whatsoever a 
man did was c no crime.

18 And  thus  he  did  preach  unto 
them,  leading  away  the  hearts  of 
many, causing them to lift up their 
heads in their wickedness, yea, lead-
ing  away  many  women,  and  also 
men, to commit whoredoms—telling 
them that when a man was dead, 
that was the end thereof.

19 Now this man went over to the 
land  of  a Jershon  also,  to  preach 
these things among the people of 
Ammon, who were once the people 
of the Lamanites.

20 But behold they were more wise 
than many of the Nephites; for they 
took him, and bound him, and car-
ried him before Ammon, who was 
a a high priest over that people.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
caused  that  he  should  be  carried 
out of the land. And he came over 
into the land of Gideon, and began 
to preach unto them also; and here 
he did not have much success, for he 
was taken and bound and carried 
before the high priest, and also the 
chief judge over the land.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
high priest said unto him: Why do 
ye  go  about  perverting  the  ways 
of the Lord? Why do ye teach this  
people that there shall be no Christ, 
to interrupt their rejoicings? Why 
do ye speak against all the prophe-
cies of the holy prophets?

23 Now the high priest’s name was 
Giddonah. And Korihor said unto 
him:  Because  I  do  not  teach  the 
foolish  traditions  of  your  fathers, 
and because I do not teach this peo-
ple to bind themselves down under 
the foolish ordinances and perfor-
mances  which  are  laid  down  by 
ancient priests, to usurp power and 
authority over them, to keep them 
in  ignorance,  that  they  may  not 
lift up their heads, but be brought 
down according to thy words.

24 Ye  say  that  this  people  is  a 
free people. Behold, I say they are 
in bondage. Ye say that those an-
cient prophecies are true. Behold, 
I say that ye do not know that they 
are true.

25 Ye say that this people is a guilty 
and a fallen people, because of the 
transgression of a parent. Behold, 
I say that a child is not guilty be-
cause of its parents.

26 And  ye  also  say  that  Christ 
shall come. But behold, I say that 
ye do not know that there shall be a 
Christ. And ye say also that he shall 
be slain for the a sins of the world—
27 And  thus  ye  lead  away  this 
people after the foolish traditions 
of  your  fathers,  and  according  to 
your own desires; and ye keep them 

down, even as it were in bondage, 
that  ye  may  glut  yourselves  with 
the labors of their hands, that they 
durst  not  look  up  with  boldness, 
and that they durst not enjoy their 
rights and privileges.

28 Yea,  they  durst  not  make  use 
of that which is their own lest they 
should offend their priests, who do  
yoke them according to their desires, 
and have brought them to believe, 
by their traditions and their dreams 
and their whims and their visions 
and  their  pretended  mysteries, 
that they should, if they did not do  
according  to  their  words,  offend 
some  unknown  being,  who  they 
say is God—a being who a never has 
been  seen  or  known,  who  b never 
was nor ever will be.

29 Now when the high priest and 
the a chief judge saw the hardness 
of  his  heart,  yea,  when  they  saw 
that he would b revile even against 
God, they would not make any reply  
to his words; but they caused that 
he should be bound; and they de-
livered  him  up  into  the  hands  of 
the  officers,  and  sent  him  to  the 
land of Zarahemla, that he might 
be  brought  before  Alma,  and  the 
chief judge who was governor over 
all the land.

30 And it came to pass that when 
he  was  brought  before  Alma  and 
the  chief  judge,  he  did  go  on  in 
the same manner as he did in the 
land of Gideon; yea, he went on to 
a blaspheme.

31 And  he  did  rise  up  in  great 
a swelling words before Alma, and 
did revile against the b priests and 
teachers, accusing them of leading  
away the people after the silly tradi-
tions of their fathers, for the sake of  
glutting on the labors of the people.
32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou 
knowest  that  we  do  not  glut  our-
selves upon the labors of this people; 
for behold I have a labored even from

the commencement of the reign of 
the  judges  until  now,  with  mine 
b own hands for my support, notwith-
standing  my  many  travels  round 
about the land to declare the word 
of God unto my people.

33 And notwithstanding the many 
labors which I have performed in 
the church, I have never received 
so much as even one a senine for my 
labor; neither has any of my breth-
ren, save it were in the judgment-
seat;  and  then  we  have  received 
only according to law for our time.
34 And now, if we do not receive 
anything  for  our  labors  in  the 
church,  what  doth  it  profit  us  to 
labor in the church save it were to  
declare the truth, that we may have  
rejoicings in the a joy of our brethren?
35 Then why sayest thou that we 
preach unto this people to get gain, 
when thou, of thyself, knowest that 
we receive no gain? And now, be-
lievest  thou  that  we  deceive  this 
people,  that  a causes  such  joy  in 
their hearts?

36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.
37 And then Alma said unto him: 
Believest thou that there is a God?

38 And he answered, Nay.
39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye 
deny again that there is a God, and  
also deny the Christ? For behold, I 
say unto you, I know there is a God, 
and also that Christ shall come.

40 And now what evidence have ye 
that there is no a God, or that Christ  
cometh not? I say unto you that ye 
have none, save it be your word only.
41 But, behold, I have all things as 
a a testimony that these things are 
true;  and  ye  also  have  all  things 
as a testimony unto you that they 
are  true;  and  will  ye  deny  them?  

Believest  thou  that  these  things 
are true?

42 Behold, I know that thou a be-
lievest, but thou art possessed with 
a  b lying  spirit,  and  ye  have  put  
c off  the  Spirit  of  God  that  it  may 
have no place in you; but the devil 
has  power  over  you,  and  he  doth 
carry  you  about,  working  devices 
that  he  may  destroy  the  children 
of God.

43 And  now  Korihor  said  unto 
Alma: If thou wilt show me a a sign, 
that I may be convinced that there 
is a God, yea, show unto me that he 
hath power, and then will I be con-
vinced of the truth of thy words.

44 But Alma said unto him: Thou 
hast had signs enough; will ye tempt 
your God? Will ye say, Show unto 
me  a  sign,  when  ye  have  the  tes-
timony of a all these thy brethren, 
and also all the holy prophets? The 
scriptures are laid before thee, yea, 
and  all  things  denote  there  is  a 
God; yea, even the b earth, and c all 
things that are upon the face of it, 
yea, and its d motion, yea, and also 
all the e planets which move in their 
regular form do witness that there 
is a Supreme Creator.

45 And yet do ye go about, lead-
ing away the hearts of this people, 
testifying  unto  them  there  is  no 
God? And yet will ye deny against 
all these  a witnesses? And he said: 
Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show  
me a sign.

46 And now it came to pass that 
Alma said unto him: Behold, I am 
grieved because of the hardness of 
your heart, yea, that ye will still re-
sist the spirit of the truth, that thy 
soul may be destroyed.

47 But behold, it is a better that thy

soul should be b lost than that thou 
shouldst be the means of bringing 
many  souls  down  to  destruction, 
by thy lying and by thy flattering 
words; therefore if thou shalt deny 
again, behold God shall smite thee, 
that thou shalt become dumb, that 
thou  shalt  never  open  thy  mouth 
any more, that thou shalt not de-
ceive this people any more.

48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do 
not deny the existence of a God, but 
I do not believe that there is a God; 
and I say also, that ye do not know 
that there is a God; and except ye  
show me a sign, I will not believe.
49 Now Alma said unto him: This 
will I give unto thee for a sign, that 
thou shalt be a struck dumb, accord-
ing to my words; and I say, that in 
the name of God, ye shall be struck 
dumb, that ye shall no more have 
utterance.

50 Now when Alma had said these 
words,  Korihor  was  struck  dumb, 
that he could not have utterance, 
according to the words of Alma.

51 And now when the chief judge 
saw this, he put forth his hand and 
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou 
convinced  of  the  power  of  God? 
In whom did ye desire that Alma 
should show forth his sign? Would 
ye that he should afflict others, to 
show unto thee a sign? Behold, he 
has  showed  unto  you  a  sign;  and 
now will ye dispute more?

52 And Korihor put forth his hand 
and  wrote,  saying:  I  know  that  I 
am dumb, for I cannot speak; and 
I  know  that  nothing  save  it  were 
the a power of God could bring this 
upon me; yea, and I always b knew 
that there was a God.

53 But  behold,  the  devil  hath 
a deceived  me;  for  he  b appeared 
unto me in the  c form of an angel, 
and said unto me: Go and reclaim 
this people, for they have all gone 

astray after an unknown God. And 
he said unto me: There is d no God; 
yea, and he taught me that which 
I should say. And I have taught his 
words; and I taught them because 
they  were  pleasing  unto  the  e car-
nal mind; and I taught them, even 
until I had much success, insomuch 
that I verily believed that they were 
true; and for this cause I withstood 
the truth, even until I have brought 
this great f curse upon me.

54 Now when he had said this, he 
besought  that  Alma  should  pray 
unto God, that the a curse might be 
taken from him.

55 But Alma said unto him: If this 
curse should be taken from thee thou 
wouldst again lead away the hearts 
of  this  people;  therefore,  it  shall  
be unto thee even as the Lord will.
56 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
curse  was  not  taken  off  of  Kori-
hor; but he was a cast out, and went 
about from house to house begging 
for his food.

57 Now  the  knowledge  of  what 
had  happened  unto  Korihor  was 
immediately published throughout 
all the land; yea, the proclamation 
was sent forth by the chief judge to 
all the people in the land, declar-
ing  unto  those  who  had  believed 
in the words of Korihor that they 
must speedily repent, a lest the same 
judgments would come unto them.
58 And it came to pass that they 
were all convinced of the wicked-
ness of Korihor; therefore they were 
all converted again unto the Lord; 
and this put an end to the iniquity 
after the manner of Korihor. And 
Korihor did go about from house to 
house, begging food for his support.
59 And it came to pass that as he 
went forth among the people, yea, 
among a people who had separated 
themselves from the Nephites and 
called themselves a Zoramites, being

led  by  a  man  whose  name  was 
Zoram—and  as  he  went  forth 
amongst them, behold, he was run 
upon and trodden down, even until 
he was b dead.

60 And  thus  we  see  the  end  of 
him  who  a perverteth  the  ways  of 
the Lord; and thus we see that the 
devil will not b support his children 
at  the  last  day,  but  doth  speedily 
drag them down to c hell.

CHAPTER 31
Alma heads a mission to reclaim the 
apostate  Zoramites—The  Zoramites 
deny  Christ,  believe  in  a  false  con-
cept of election, and worship with set 
prayers—The  missionaries  are  filled 
with the Holy Spirit—Their afflictions 
are swallowed up in the joy of Christ. 
About 74 b.c.
Now it came to pass that after the end 
of Korihor, Alma having received  
tidings that the Zoramites were per-
verting the ways of the Lord, and 
that Zoram, who was their leader, 
was leading the hearts of the peo-
ple to  a bow down to dumb  b idols, 
his heart again began to c sicken be-
cause of the iniquity of the people.
2 For it was the cause of great a sor-
row  to  Alma  to  know  of  iniquity 
among  his  people;  therefore  his 
heart  was  exceedingly  b sorrowful 
because  of  the  separation  of  the 
Zoramites from the Nephites.

3 Now  the  Zoramites  had  gath-
ered themselves together in a land 
which they called a Antionum, which 
was east of the land of Zarahemla, 
which lay nearly bordering upon the  

seashore, which was south of the land 
of  b Jershon,  which  also  bordered 
upon the wilderness south, which  
wilderness was full of the Lamanites.
4 Now the Nephites greatly feared 
that the Zoramites would enter into 
a  a correspondence  with  the  La-
manites, and that it would be the 
means of great loss on the part of 
the Nephites.

5 And  now,  as  the  a preaching  of 
the b word had a great tendency to 
c lead the people to do that which 
was just—yea, it had had more pow-
erful effect upon the minds of the  
people than the sword, or anything 
else,  which  had  happened  unto 
them—therefore  Alma  thought  it 
was expedient that they should try 
the virtue of the word of God.

6 Therefore he took Ammon, and 
Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he 
did  leave  in  the  church  in  Zara-
hemla;  but  the  former  three  he 
took  with  him,  and  also  a Amulek 
and Zeezrom, who were at b Melek; 
and he also took two of his sons.

7 Now  the  eldest  of  his  sons  he 
took  not  with  him,  and  his  name 
was  Helaman;  but  the  names  of 
those whom he took with him were 
a Shiblon and b Corianton; and these 
are the names of those who went 
with him among the c Zoramites, to 
preach unto them the word.

8 Now  the  Zoramites  were  a dis-
senters  from  the  Nephites;  there-
fore they had had the word of God 
preached unto them.

9 But they had a fallen into great 
errors, for they would not observe 
to keep the commandments of God,

and his statutes, according to the 
law of Moses.

10 Neither  would  they  observe 
the  a performances  of  the  church, 
to continue in prayer and suppli-
cation to God daily, that they might 
not enter into temptation.

11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert 
the ways of the Lord in very many 
instances; therefore, for this cause, 
Alma and his brethren went into 
the land to preach the word unto 
them.

12 Now, when they had come into 
the land, behold, to their astonish-
ment they found that the Zoram-
ites had built synagogues, and that 
they did gather themselves together 
on one day of the week, which day 
they did call the day of the Lord; 
and they did a worship after a man-
ner which Alma and his brethren 
had never beheld;

13 For they had a place built up 
in the center of their synagogue, a 
place for standing, which was high 
above the head; and the top thereof 
would only admit one person.

14 Therefore, whosoever desired to 
a worship must go forth and stand 
upon the top thereof, and stretch 
forth  his  hands  towards  heaven, 
and cry with a loud voice, saying:
15 Holy, holy God; we believe that  
thou  art  God,  and  we  believe  
that  thou  art  holy,  and  that  thou 
wast a  a spirit, and that thou art a 
spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit 
forever.

16 Holy God, we believe that thou 
hast separated us from our breth-
ren; and we do not believe in the 
tradition  of  our  brethren,  which 
was handed down to them by the 
childishness of their fathers; but we 
believe that thou hast  a elected us 
to be thy  b holy children; and also 
thou hast made it known unto us 
that c there shall be d no Christ.

17 But thou art the same yesterday, 
today, and forever; and thou hast 
a elected us that we shall be saved, 
whilst all around us are elected to 
be cast by thy wrath down to hell; 
for  the  which  holiness,  O  God, 
we thank thee; and we also thank 
thee that thou hast elected us, that 
we may not be led away after the 
foolish traditions of our brethren, 
which doth b bind them down to a 
belief  of  Christ,  which  doth  lead 
their hearts to wander far from thee,  
our God.

18 And  again  we  thank  thee,  O 
God,  that  we  are  a  chosen  and  a 
holy people. Amen.

19 Now it came to pass that after 
Alma and his brethren and his sons 
had heard these prayers, they were 
astonished beyond all measure.

20 For  behold,  every  man  did 
go  forth  and  offer  up  these  same 
a prayers.

21 Now  the  place  was  called  by 
them Rameumptom, which, being 
interpreted, is the holy stand.

22 Now, from this stand they did 
offer up, every man, the selfsame 
prayer  unto  God,  thanking  their 
God that they were chosen of him, 
and that he did not lead them away 
after the tradition of their brethren, 
and that their hearts were not stolen 
away to believe in things to come, 
which they knew nothing about.

23 Now, after the people had all 
offered up thanks after this man-
ner, they returned to their homes, 
a never speaking of their God again 
until they had assembled themselves 
together again to the holy stand, to 
offer up thanks after their manner.
24 Now  when  Alma  saw  this  his 
heart was a grieved; for he saw that 
they were a wicked and a perverse 
people; yea, he saw that their hearts 
were set upon gold, and upon silver, 
and upon all manner of fine goods.

25 Yea, and he also saw that their 
hearts  were  a lifted  up  unto  great 
boasting, in their pride.

26 And  he  lifted  up  his  voice  to 
heaven, and a cried, saying: O, how 
long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that 
thy servants shall dwell here below 
in the flesh, to behold such gross 
wickedness among the children of 
men?

27 Behold, O God, they a cry unto 
thee, and yet their hearts are swal-

God, they cry unto thee with their 
mouths, while they are b puffed up, 
even  to  greatness,  with  the  vain 
things of the c world.

apparel, and their ringlets, and their 
a bracelets, and their ornaments of

which they are ornamented with; 
and behold, their hearts are set upon 
them, and yet they cry unto thee 
and say—We thank thee, O God, for 
we are a chosen people unto thee, 
while others shall perish.

29 Yea, and they say that thou hast 
made it known unto them that there 
shall be no Christ.

30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou 
suffer that such wickedness and in-
fidelity shall be among this people? 
O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, 
that I may  a bear with mine infir-
mities. For I am infirm, and such 
wickedness among this people doth 
pain my soul.

31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly 
sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul 
a in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant 
unto me that I may have strength, 
that  I  may  suffer  with  patience 
these b afflictions which shall come 
upon me, because of the iniquity 
of this people.

32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my 
soul, and give unto me success, and 
also my fellow laborers who are with 
me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and 
Omner, and also a Amulek and Zeez-
rom, and also my  b two sons—yea, 
even all these wilt thou comfort, O 
Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their 
souls in Christ.

33 Wilt thou grant unto them that 
they may have strength, that they 
may  a bear their afflictions which 
shall come upon them because of 
the iniquities of this people.

34 O Lord, wilt thou grant a unto us 
that we may have success in bring-
ing them again unto thee in Christ.
35 Behold, O Lord, their a souls are 
precious,  and  many  of  them  are 
our brethren; therefore, give unto 
us, O Lord, power and wisdom that 
we may bring these, our brethren, 
again unto thee.

36 Now it came to pass that when 
Alma  had  said  these  words,  that 
he  a clapped  his  b hands  upon  all 
them who were with him. And be-
hold, as he clapped his hands upon 
them,  they  were  filled  with  the  
Holy Spirit.

37 And  after  that  they  did  sepa-
rate themselves one from another, 
a taking no thought for themselves 
what they should eat, or what they 
should drink, or what they should  
put on.

38 And  the  Lord  provided  for 
them that they should hunger not, 
neither  should  they  thirst;  yea, 
and  he  also  gave  them  strength, 
that they should suffer no manner 
of  a afflictions,  save  it  were  swal-
lowed up in the joy of Christ. Now 
this was according to the prayer of 
Alma; and this because he prayed  
in b faith.

CHAPTER 32

Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions 
had humbled them—Faith is a hope in 
that which is not seen which is true—
Alma testifies that angels minister to 
men, women, and children—Alma com-
pares the word unto a seed—It must be 
planted and nourished—Then it grows 
into a tree from which the fruit of eter-
nal life is picked. About 74 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
go forth, and began to preach the 
word of God unto the people, enter-
ing into their synagogues, and into 
their houses; yea, and even they did 
preach the word in their streets.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
much labor among them, they be-
gan to have success among the a poor 
class  of  people;  for  behold,  they 
were  cast  out  of  the  synagogues 
because of the coarseness of their  
apparel—

3 Therefore they were not permit-
ted to enter into their synagogues 
to  worship  God,  being  esteemed 
as  filthiness;  therefore  they  were 
poor; yea, they were esteemed by 
their brethren as a dross; therefore 
they were b poor as to things of the 
world;  and  also  they  were  poor  
in heart.

4 Now, as Alma was teaching and 
speaking unto the people upon the 
hill  a Onidah,  there  came  a  great 
b multitude  unto  him,  who  were 
those of whom we have been speak-
ing, of whom were c poor in heart, 
because of their poverty as to the 
things of the world.

5 And they came unto Alma; and 
the one who was the foremost among 
them said unto him: Behold, a what 
shall these my brethren do, for they 
are b despised of all men because of  

their poverty, yea, and more espe-
cially by our priests; for they have  
c cast us out of our synagogues which 
we have labored abundantly to build 
with our own hands; and they have 
cast us out because of our exceed-
ing poverty; and we have d no place 
to  worship  our  God;  and  behold, 
e what shall we do?

6 And  now  when  Alma  heard 
this, he turned him about, his face 
immediately towards him, and he 
beheld  with  great  joy;  for  he  be-
held  that  their  a afflictions  had 
truly  b humbled  them,  and  that 
they were in a c preparation to hear  
the word.

7 Therefore he did say no more to  
the other multitude; but he stretched 
forth his hand, and cried unto those 
whom he beheld, who were truly 
penitent, and said unto them:

8 I  behold  that  ye  are  a lowly  in 

heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

9 Behold  thy  brother  hath  said, 
What shall we do?—for we are cast 
out of our synagogues, that we can-
not worship our God.

10 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  do  ye  
suppose  that  ye  a cannot  worship  
God save it be in your synagogues 
only ?

11 And moreover, I would ask, do 
ye suppose that ye must not worship 
God only a once in a week?

12 I say unto you, it is well that ye  
are cast out of your synagogues, that 
ye may be humble, and that ye may 
learn  a wisdom; for it is necessary 
that  ye  should  learn  wisdom;  for 
it  is  because  that  ye  are  cast  out,  
that ye are despised of your brethren 
because of your exceeding b poverty, 
that ye are brought to a lowliness of 
heart; for ye are necessarily brought 
to be humble.

ALMA 32  : 13–27

13 And now, because ye are com-
pelled to be humble blessed are ye; 
for a man sometimes, if he is com-
pelled to be humble, seeketh a repen-
tance; and now surely, whosoever 
repenteth shall find mercy; and he 
that findeth mercy and b endureth 
to the end the same shall be saved.
14 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
that  because  ye  were  compelled 
to be a humble ye were blessed, do 
ye not suppose that they are more 
blessed  who  truly  humble  them-
selves because of the word?

15 Yea,  he  that  truly  humbleth 
himself, and repenteth of his sins, 
and endureth to the end, the same 
shall be blessed—yea, much more 
blessed  than  they  who  are  com-
pelled  to  be  humble  because  of 
their exceeding poverty.

16 Therefore, blessed are they who 
a humble themselves without being 
b compelled to be humble; or rather, 
in other words, blessed is he that 
believeth in the word of God, and is 
baptized without c stubbornness of 
heart, yea, without being brought to 
know the word, or even compelled 
to know, before they will believe.

17 Yea, there are many who do say: 
If  thou  wilt  show  unto  us  a  a sign 
from heaven, then we shall know 
of a surety; then we shall believe.

18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, 
I  say  unto  you,  Nay;  for  if  a  man 
knoweth a thing he hath no cause 
to a believe, for he knoweth it.

19 And  now,  how  much  a more 
b cursed  is  he  that  c knoweth  the 
d will of God and doeth it not, than 
he that only believeth, or only hath 
cause  to  believe,  and  falleth  into 
e transgression?

20 Now of this thing ye must judge. 

Behold, I say unto you, that it is on 
the  one  hand  even  as  it  is  on  the 
other;  and  it  shall  be  unto  every 
man according to his work.

21 And now as I said concerning 
faith—a faith  is  not  to  have  a  per-
fect knowledge of things; therefore 
if ye have faith ye b hope for things 
which are c not seen, which are true.
22 And  now,  behold,  I  say  unto 
you, and I would that ye should re-
member, that God is a merciful unto 
all who believe on his name; there-
fore he desireth, in the first place, 
that  ye  should  believe,  yea,  even  
on his word.

23 And now, he imparteth his word 
by angels unto men, yea, a not only 
men but women also. Now this is not 
all; little  b children do have words 
given unto them many times, which 
c confound the wise and the learned.
24 And now, my beloved brethren, 
as ye have desired to know of me 
what ye shall do because ye are af-
flicted and cast out—now I do not 
desire that ye should suppose that 
I mean to judge you only according 
to that which is true—

25 For I do not mean that ye all of 
you have been compelled to hum-
ble yourselves; for I verily believe 
that there are some among you who 
a would humble themselves, let them 
be  in  whatsoever  circumstances 
they might.

26 Now, as I said concerning faith—
that  it  was  not  a  perfect  knowl-
edge—even so it is with my words. 
Ye cannot know of their surety at 
first,  unto  perfection,  any  more 
than faith is a perfect knowledge.
27 But  behold,  if  ye  will  awake 
and arouse your faculties, even to 
an experiment upon my words, and

exercise a particle of faith, yea, even 
if ye can no more than  a desire to 
believe, let this desire work in you, 
even until ye believe in a manner 
that ye can give place for a portion 
of my words.

28 Now, we will compare the word  
unto a a seed. Now, if ye give place, 
that a b seed may be planted in your 
c heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or 
a good seed, if ye do not cast it out 
by your d unbelief, that ye will resist 
the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will 
begin to swell within your breasts; 
and  when  you  feel  these  swell-
ing  motions,  ye  will  begin  to  say  
within yourselves—It must needs be  
that this is a good seed, or that the 
word is good, for it beginneth to en-
large my soul; yea, it beginneth to 
e enlighten my f understanding, yea, 
it beginneth to be delicious to me.
29 Now behold, would not this in-
crease your faith? I say unto you, 
Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown 
up to a perfect knowledge.

30 But behold, as the seed swell-
eth, and sprouteth, and beginneth 
to grow, then you must needs say 
that the seed is good; for behold it 
swelleth, and sprouteth, and begin-
neth to grow. And now, behold, will 
not this strengthen your faith? Yea, 
it will strengthen your faith: for ye 
will say I know that this is a good 
seed;  for  behold  it  sprouteth  and 
beginneth to grow.

31 And now, behold, are ye sure 
that this is a good seed? I say unto 
you,  Yea;  for  every  seed  bringeth 
forth unto its own a likeness.

32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it 
is good, but if it groweth not, be-
hold it is not good, therefore it is  
cast away.

33 And  now,  behold,  because  ye 
have  tried  the  experiment,  and 
planted  the  seed,  and  it  swelleth 

and  sprouteth,  and  beginneth  to 
grow, ye must needs know that the 
seed is good.

34 And now, behold, is your a knowl-
edge b perfect? Yea, your knowledge 
is  perfect  in  that  thing,  and  your 
c faith is dormant; and this because 
you  know,  for  ye  know  that  the 
word hath swelled your souls, and 
ye also know that it hath sprouted 
up, that your understanding doth 
begin to be enlightened, and your 
d mind doth begin to expand.

35 O  then,  is  not  this  real?  I  say 
unto you, Yea, because it is a light; 
and  whatsoever  is  light,  is  b good, 
because it is discernible, therefore 
ye must know that it is good; and 
now  behold,  after  ye  have  tasted 
this light is your knowledge perfect?
36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; nei-
ther must ye lay aside your faith, for 
ye have only exercised your faith 
to plant the seed that ye might try 
the experiment to know if the seed 
was good.

37 And behold, as the tree begin-
neth  to  grow,  ye  will  say:  Let  us 
nourish it with great care, that it 
may get root, that it may grow up, 
and bring forth fruit unto us. And 
now behold, if ye nourish it with 
much care it will get root, and grow 
up, and bring forth fruit.

38 But if ye a neglect the tree, and 
take no thought for its nourishment, 
behold it will not get any root; and 
when the heat of the sun cometh 
and scorcheth it, because it hath no 
root it withers away, and ye pluck 
it up and cast it out.

39 Now,  this  is  not  because  the 
seed was not good, neither is it be-
cause the fruit thereof would not 
be desirable; but it is because your 
a ground is b barren, and ye will not 
nourish the tree, therefore ye can-
not have the fruit thereof.

40 And thus, if ye will not nourish 
the word, looking forward with an 
eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye 
can never pluck of the fruit of the 
a tree of life.

41 But if ye will nourish the word, 
yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth 
to  grow,  by  your  faith  with  great 
diligence, and with a patience, look-
ing forward to the fruit thereof, it 
shall take root; and behold it shall 
be a tree b springing up unto ever-

42 And because of your a diligence 
and your faith and your patience 
with the word in nourishing it, that 
it may take root in you, behold, by  
and  by  ye  shall  pluck  the  b fruit 
thereof,  which  is  most  precious, 
which  is  sweet  above  all  that  is 
sweet, and which is white above all 
that is white, yea, and pure above 
all that is pure; and ye shall feast 
upon  this  fruit  even  until  ye  are 
filled, that ye hunger not, neither 
shall ye thirst.

43 Then,  my  brethren,  ye  shall 
a reap  the  b rewards  of  your  faith, 
and your diligence, and patience, 
and long-suffering, waiting for the 
tree to bring forth c fruit unto you.

CHAPTER 33
Zenos taught that men should pray and 
worship in all places, and that judgments 
are turned away because of the Son—
Zenock taught that mercy is bestowed 
because of the Son—Moses had lifted 
up in the wilderness a type of the Son 
of God. About 74 b.c.
Now after Alma had spoken these 
words, they sent forth unto him de-
siring to know whether they should 
believe in a one God, that they might 

obtain this fruit of which he had 
spoken, or b how they should plant 
the c seed, or the word of which he 
had spoken, which he said must be 
planted in their hearts; or in what 
manner they should begin to exer-
cise their faith.

2 And Alma said unto them: Be-
hold,  ye  have  said  that  ye  a could 
not b worship your God because ye 
are cast out of your synagogues. But 
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose  
that ye cannot worship God, ye do 
greatly err, and ye ought to search 
the  c scriptures; if ye suppose that 
they have taught you this, ye do not 
understand them.

3 Do  ye  remember  to  have  read 
what a Zenos, the prophet of old, has 
said concerning prayer or b worship?
4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O 
God, for thou hast heard my prayer, 
even when I was a in the wilderness; 
yea,  thou  wast  merciful  when  I 
prayed concerning those who were 
mine b enemies, and thou didst turn 
them to me.

5 Yea, O God, and thou wast mer-
ciful unto me when I did cry unto 
thee  in  my  a field;  when  I  did  cry 
unto  thee  in  my  prayer,  and  thou 
didst hear me.

6 And  again,  O  God,  when  I  did 
turn to my house thou didst hear 
me in my prayer.

7 And  when  I  did  turn  unto  my 
a closet,  O  Lord,  and  prayed  unto 
thee, thou didst hear me.

8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy 
children when they cry unto thee, 
to be heard of thee and not of men, 
and thou a wilt hear them.

9 Yea, O God, thou hast been mer-
ciful unto me, and heard my cries 
in the midst of thy congregations.

10 Yea, and thou hast also heard 
me when I have been a cast out and 
have  been  despised  by  mine  en-
emies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, 
and wast angry with mine enemies, 
and thou didst b visit them in thine 
anger with speedy destruction.

11 And  thou  didst  hear  me  be-
cause  of  mine  afflictions  and  my 
a sincerity; and it is because of thy 
Son that thou hast been thus mer-
ciful unto me, therefore I will cry 
unto thee in all mine  b afflictions, 
for in thee is my joy; for thou hast 
turned thy judgments away from 
me, c because of thy Son.

12 And now Alma said unto them: 
Do ye a believe those scriptures which  
have been written by them of old?
13 Behold,  if  ye  do,  ye  must  be-
lieve what a Zenos said; for, behold 
he said: Thou hast turned away thy 
judgments because of thy Son.

14 Now  behold,  my  brethren,  I 
would ask if ye have read the scrip-
tures? If ye have, how can ye a dis-
believe on the Son of God?

15 For it is  a not written that Ze-
nos alone spake of these things, but 
b Zenock also spake of these things—
16 For behold, he said: Thou art 
angry, O Lord, with this people, be-
cause they a will not understand thy 
mercies which thou hast bestowed 
upon them because of thy Son.

17 And now, my brethren, ye see 
that  a  second  prophet  of  old  has 
testified of the Son of God, and be-
cause the people would not under-
stand his words they  a stoned him  
to death.

18 But behold, this is not all; these 

are  not  the  only  ones  who  have 
spoken concerning the Son of God.
19 Behold,  he  was  spoken  of  by 
a Moses; yea, and behold a b type was 
c raised  up  in  the  wilderness,  that 
whosoever would look upon it might 
live. And many did look and live.
20 But few understood the mean-
ing of those things, and this because 
of  the  hardness  of  their  hearts. 
But there were many who were so 
hardened that they would not look, 
therefore  they  perished.  Now  the 
reason they would not look is be-
cause they did not believe that it 
would a heal them.

21 O my brethren, if ye could be 
healed  by  merely  casting  about 
your eyes that ye might be healed, 
would  ye  not  behold  quickly,  or 
would ye rather harden your hearts 
in a unbelief, and be b slothful, that 
ye would not cast about your eyes, 
that ye might perish?

22 If so, wo shall come upon you; 
but if not so, then cast about your 
eyes  and  a begin  to  believe  in  the 
Son of God, that he will come to re-
deem his people, and that he shall 
suffer  and  die  to  b atone  for  their 
sins; and that he shall  c rise again 
from  the  dead,  which  shall  bring 
to  pass  the  d resurrection,  that  all 
men shall stand before him, to be 
e judged  at  the  last  and  judgment 
day, according to their f works.

23 And now, my brethren, I desire 
that ye shall a plant this word in your 
hearts, and as it beginneth to swell 
even so nourish it by your faith. And 
behold, it will become a tree, b spring-

you  that  your  d burdens  may  be

Amen.

CHAPTER 34
Amulek  testifies  that  the  word  is  in 
Christ  unto  salvation —Unless  an 
atonement is made, all mankind must 
perish—The whole law of Moses points 
toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—
The eternal plan of redemption is based 
on faith and repentance—Pray for tem-
poral and spiritual blessings—This life 
is the time for men to prepare to meet 
God—Work  out  your  salvation  with 
fear before God. About 74 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
Alma had spoken these words unto 
them he sat down upon the ground, 
and  a Amulek  arose  and  began  to 
teach them, saying:

2 My  brethren,  I  think  that  it  is 
impossible that ye should be igno-
rant of the things which have been 
spoken concerning the coming of 
Christ,  who  is  taught  by  us  to  be 
the  Son  of  God;  yea,  I  know  that 
a these things were taught unto you 
bountifully before your dissension 
from among us.

3 And as ye have desired of my be-
loved brother that he should make 
known  unto  you  a what  ye  should 
do, because of your afflictions; and 
he hath spoken somewhat unto you 
to prepare your minds; yea, and he 
hath exhorted you unto faith and 
to patience—

4 Yea, even that ye would have so 
much  faith  as  even  to  a plant  the 

word  in  your  hearts,  that  ye  may 
try the experiment of its goodness.
5 And  we  have  beheld  that  the 
great  question  which  is  in  your 
minds is whether the word be in the 
Son of God, or whether there shall  
be a no Christ.

6 And  ye  also  beheld  that  my 
brother  has  proved  unto  you,  in 
many instances, that the  a word is 
in Christ unto salvation.

7 My brother has called upon the 
words of  a Zenos, that redemption 
cometh through the Son of God, and 
also upon the words of b Zenock; and 
also he has appealed unto c Moses, 
to prove that these things are true.
8 And now, behold, I will a testify 
unto you of myself that these things 
are true. Behold, I say unto you, that 
I  do  know  that  Christ  shall  come 
among the children of men, to take 
upon him the b transgressions of his 
people, and that he shall c atone for 
the sins of the world; for the Lord 
God hath spoken it.

9 For it is expedient that an a atone-
ment should be made; for according 
to the great b plan of the Eternal God 
there must be an atonement made, 
or else all mankind must unavoid-
ably perish; yea, all are hardened; 
yea, all are c fallen and are lost, and 
must  perish  except  it  be  through 
the atonement which it is expedient  
should be made.

10 For  it  is  expedient  that  there 
should be a great and last a sacrifice;  
yea, not a b sacrifice of man, neither 
of beast, neither of any manner of 
fowl;  for  it  shall  not  be  a  human 
sacrifice; but it must be an c infinite 
and d eternal e sacrifice.

294

11 Now there is not any man that 
can sacrifice his own blood which 
will atone for the sins of another. 
Now, if a man murdereth, behold 
will  our  law,  which  is  a just,  take 
the life of his brother? I say unto 
you, Nay.

12 But the law requireth the a life 
of him who hath b murdered; there-
fore there can be nothing which is 
short of an infinite atonement which  
will suffice for the sins of the world.
13 Therefore, it is expedient that 
there  should  be  a  great  and  last 
sacrifice, and then shall there be, 
or it is expedient there should be, 
a  a stop to the shedding of  b blood; 
then shall the c law of Moses be ful-
filled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, 
every jot and tittle, and none shall 
have passed away.

14 And  behold,  this  is  the  whole 
a meaning  of  the  b law,  every  whit 
c pointing to that great and last d sacri-
fice; and that great and last e sacrifice 
will be the Son of God, yea, f  infinite  
and eternal.

15 And  thus  he  shall  bring  a sal-
vation  to  all  those  who  shall  be-
lieve  on  his  name;  this  being  the 
intent of this last sacrifice, to bring 
about the bowels of mercy, which 
overpowereth justice, and bringeth 
about  means  unto  men  that  they 
may have faith unto repentance.

16 And  thus  a mercy  can  satisfy  
the  demands  of  b justice,  and  en-
circles them in the arms of safety, 
while  he  that  exercises  no  faith 
unto repentance is exposed to the 

whole law of the demands of c jus-
tice; therefore only unto him that 
has faith unto repentance is brought 
about the great and eternal d plan of  
e redemption.

17 Therefore may God grant unto 
you, my brethren, that ye may begin 
to exercise your a faith unto repen-
tance, that ye begin to  b call upon 
his holy name, that he would have 
mercy upon you;

18 Yea,  cry  unto  him  for  mercy; 

for he is a mighty to save.

19 Yea,  humble  yourselves,  and 

continue in a prayer unto him.

20 Cry unto him when ye are in 
your a fields, yea, over all your flocks.
21 a Cry unto him in your houses, 
yea, over all your household, both 
morning, mid-day, and evening.

22 Yea, cry unto him against the 

power of your a enemies.

23 Yea, a cry unto him against the 
b devil, who is an enemy to all c righ-
teousness.

24 Cry  unto  him  over  the  crops 
of your fields, that ye may prosper 
in them.

25 Cry  over  the  flocks  of  your 

fields, that they may increase.

26 But  this  is  not  all;  ye  must 
a pour out your souls in your b clos-
ets, and your secret places, and in 
your wilderness.

27 Yea, and when you do not cry 
unto the Lord, let your a hearts be 
b full, drawn out in prayer unto him 
continually for your c welfare, and 
also for the welfare of d those who 
are around you.

ALMA 34  : 28–37

28 And now behold, my beloved 
brethren, I say unto you, do not sup-
pose that this is all; for after ye have 
done  all  these  things,  if  ye  a turn 
away  the  b needy,  and  the  c naked, 
and visit not the sick and afflicted, 
and d impart of your substance, if ye 
have, to those who stand in need—I 
say  unto  you,  if  ye  do  not  any  of 
these things, behold, your e prayer 
is f vain, and availeth you nothing, 
and ye are as  g hypocrites who do 
deny the faith.

29 Therefore, if ye do not remem-
ber to be a charitable, ye are as dross, 
which the refiners do cast out, (it 
being of no worth) and is trodden 
under foot of men.

30 And now, my brethren, I would 
that,  after  ye  have  a received  so 
many witnesses, seeing that the holy 
scriptures testify of these things, ye 
come  forth  and  bring  b fruit  unto 
repentance.

31 Yea, I would that ye would come 
forth and a harden not your hearts 
any longer; for behold, now is the 
time and the b day of your c salvation;  
and therefore, if ye will repent and 
d harden not your hearts, immedi-
ately shall the great plan of redemp-
tion be brought about unto you.

32 For behold, this a life is the time 
for men to  b prepare to meet God; 
yea, behold the day of c this life is 
the day for men to perform their 
d labors.

a witnesses, therefore, I beseech of 
you that ye do not b procrastinate the 
day of your  c repentance until the 
end; for after this day of life, which 
is given us to prepare for eternity, 
behold, if we do not improve our 
time while in this life, then cometh 
the  d night  of  e darkness  wherein 
there can be no labor performed.

34 Ye  cannot  say,  when  ye  are 
brought to that awful  a crisis, that 
I will repent, that I will return to 
my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for 
that same spirit which doth b possess 
your bodies at the time that ye go 
out of this life, that same spirit will 
have power to possess your body in 
that eternal world.

35 For behold, if ye have procras-
tinated the day of your repentance 
even until death, behold, ye have 
become a subjected to the spirit of 
the devil, and he doth b seal you his; 
therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath 
withdrawn from you, and hath no 
place  in  you,  and  the  devil  hath 
all power over you; and this is the 
final state of the wicked.

36 And  this  I  know,  because  the 
Lord hath said he dwelleth not in 
a unholy temples, but in the b hearts 
of the c righteous doth he dwell; yea, 
and he has also said that the righ-
teous  shall  sit  down  in  his  king-
dom, to go no more out; but their 
garments  should  be  made  white 
through the d blood of the Lamb.

33 And  now,  as  I  said  unto  you

these  things,  and  that  ye  should 
a work out your salvation with fear 
before God, and that ye should no 
more deny the coming of Christ;

38 That  ye  a contend  no  more  
against the Holy Ghost, but that ye 
receive it, and take upon you the 
b name of Christ; that ye humble your-
selves even to the dust, and c worship 
God, in whatsoever place ye may be 
in, in spirit and in truth; and that 
ye live in  d thanksgiving daily, for  
the  many  e mercies  and  blessings 
which he doth bestow upon you.

39 Yea, and I also a exhort you, my 
brethren, that ye be b watchful unto 
prayer continually, that ye may not 
be  led  away  by  the  c temptations 
of the devil, that he may not over-
power you, that ye may not become 
his subjects at the last day; for be-
hold,  he  rewardeth  you  d no  good  
thing.

40 And now my beloved brethren, I 
would exhort you to have a patience, 
and that ye bear with all manner 
of b afflictions; that ye do not c revile 
against those who do cast you out 
because  of  your  d exceeding  pov-
erty,  lest  ye  become  sinners  like 
unto them;

41 But that ye have a patience, and 
bear with those b afflictions, with a 
firm hope that ye shall one day rest 
from all your afflictions.

CHAPTER 35

The  preaching  of  the  word  destroys 
the craft of the Zoramites—They expel 
the converts, who then join the people 
of Ammon in Jershon—Alma sorrows 
because of the wickedness of the people. 
About 74 b.c.
Now  it  came  to  pass  that  after  
Amulek had made an end of these 

words,  they  withdrew  themselves 
from the multitude and came over 
into the land of a Jershon.

2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, 
after they had preached the word 
unto the a Zoramites, also came over 
into the land of Jershon.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
the more popular part of the Zor-
amites had consulted together con-
cerning the words which had been 
preached unto them, they were an-
gry because of the word, for it did 
destroy their a craft; therefore they 
would not hearken unto the words.
4 And  they  sent  and  gathered 
together  throughout  all  the  land 
all the people, and consulted with 
them concerning the words which 
had been spoken.

5 Now their rulers and their priests 
and their teachers did not let the 
people  know  concerning  their 
desires;  therefore  they  found  out 
privily the minds of all the people.
6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
they  had  found  out  the  minds  of 
all the people, those who were in 
favor of the words which had been 
spoken by Alma and his brethren 
were cast out of the land; and they 
were  a many;  and  they  came  over 
also into the land of Jershon.

7 And it came to pass that Alma 
and his brethren did minister unto 
them.

8 Now  the  people  of  the  Zoram-
ites were angry with the a people of 
Ammon who were in Jershon, and 
the  b chief  ruler  of  the  Zoramites, 
being a very wicked man, sent over 
unto the people of Ammon desiring 
them that they should cast out of 
their land all those who came over 
from them into their land.

9 And  he  breathed  out  many

threatenings  against  them.  And 
now the people of Ammon did not 
fear their words; therefore they did 
not cast them out, but they did re-
ceive all the poor of the Zoramites 
that came over unto them; and they 
did a nourish them, and did clothe 
them, and did give unto them lands 
for their inheritance; and they did 
administer unto them according to 
their wants.

10 Now this did a stir up the Zoram-
ites to b anger against the people of 
Ammon, and they began to mix with 
the Lamanites and to stir them up 
also to anger against them.

11 And thus the Zoramites and the 
Lamanites began to make prepara-
tions for war against the people of Am- 
mon, and also against the Nephites.
12 And thus ended the seventeenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

13 And the people of Ammon de-
parted out of the land of Jershon, 
and came over into the land of Me-
lek, and gave place in the land of 
Jershon for the armies of the Neph-
ites, that they might contend with 
the armies of the Lamanites and the  
armies of the Zoramites; and thus 
commenced a war betwixt the La-
manites  and  the  Nephites,  in  the 
eighteenth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the  judges;  and  an  a account  shall 
be given of their wars hereafter.

14 And  Alma,  and  Ammon,  and 
their  brethren,  and  also  the  a two 
sons of Alma returned to the land 
of  Zarahemla,  after  having  been 
instruments  in  the  hands  of  God 
of bringing  b many of the  c Zoram-
ites to repentance; and as many as 
were  brought  to  repentance  were 
driven out of their land; but they 
have lands for their inheritance in 
the land of Jershon, and they have 
taken up arms to defend themselves, 

and their wives, and children, and 
their lands.

15 Now Alma, being a grieved for 
the iniquity of his people, yea for the  
wars, and the bloodsheds, and the 
contentions  which  were  among 
them; and having been to declare 
the word, or sent to declare the word,  
among all the people in every city; 
and  seeing  that  the  hearts  of  the 
people began to wax hard, and that 
they began to be b offended because 
of  the  strictness  of  the  word,  his 
heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

16 Therefore,  he  caused  that  his 
sons should be gathered together, 
that he might give unto them every 
one  his  a charge,  separately,  con-
cerning the things pertaining unto 
righteousness. And we have an ac-
count of his commandments, which 
he  gave  unto  them  according  to  
his own record.

The commandments of Alma to his 
son Helaman.

Comprising chapters 36 and 37.

CHAPTER 36

Alma testifies to Helaman of his conver-
sion after seeing an angel—He suffered 
the pains of a damned soul; he called upon 
the name of Jesus, and was then born of 
God—Sweet joy filled his soul—He saw 
concourses of angels praising God—Many 
converts have tasted and seen as he has 
tasted and seen. About 74 b.c.
My a son, give ear to my words; for 
I swear unto you, that inasmuch as 
ye shall keep the commandments 
of God ye shall prosper in the land.
2 I  would  that  ye  should  do  as 
I  have  done,  in  remembering  the 
captivity  of  our  fathers;  for  they 
were in a bondage, and none could

b deliver  them  except  it  was  the 
c God of Abraham, and the God of 
Isaac,  and  the  God  of  Jacob;  and 
he surely did deliver them in their  
afflictions.

3 And  now,  O  my  son  Helaman, 
behold, thou art in thy youth, and 
therefore,  I  beseech  of  thee  that 
thou wilt hear my words and learn 
of me; for I do know that whosoever 
shall put their a trust in God shall be 
supported in their b trials, and their 
troubles, and their afflictions, and 
shall be c lifted up at the last day.

4 And I would not that ye think 
that I a know of myself—not of the 
temporal but of the spiritual, not of 
the b carnal mind but of God.

5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I 
had not been a born of God I should 
b not have known these things; but 
God has, by the mouth of his holy 
c angel,  made  these  things  known 
unto  me,  not  of  any  d worthiness 
of myself;

6 For I went about with the sons 
of Mosiah, seeking to a destroy the 
church of God; but behold, God sent 
his holy angel to stop us by the way.
7 And behold, he spake unto us, 
as  it  were  the  voice  of  thunder, 
and the whole earth did  a tremble 
beneath our feet; and we all fell to 
the earth, for the b fear of the Lord 
came upon us.

8 But behold, the voice said unto 
me:  Arise.  And  I  arose  and  stood 
up, and beheld the angel.

9 And  he  said  unto  me:  If  thou 
wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no 
more to destroy the church of God.
10 And it came to pass that I fell to 

the earth; and it was for the space 
of  a three  days  and  three  nights  
that  I  could  not  open  my  mouth, 
neither had I the use of my limbs.
11 And  the  angel  spake  more 
things unto me, which were heard 
by my brethren, but I did a not hear 
them; for when I heard the words—
If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, 
seek no more to destroy the church 
of God—I was struck with such great 
fear and amazement lest perhaps I 
should be destroyed, that I fell to 
the earth and I did hear no more.

12 But I was racked with a eternal 
b torment, for my soul was c harrowed 
up to the greatest degree and racked 
with all my sins.

13 Yea, I did remember all my sins 
and iniquities, for which I was a tor-
mented with the b pains of hell; yea, 
I  saw  that  I  had  c rebelled  against 
my God, and that I had not kept his 
holy commandments.

14 Yea, and I had a murdered many 
of his children, or rather led them 
away unto destruction; yea, and in 
fine so great had been my iniqui-
ties, that the very thought of com-
ing  into  the  presence  of  my  God 
did rack my soul with inexpressible  
horror.

15 Oh, thought I, that I a could be 
banished and become extinct both 
soul and body, that I might not be 
brought to stand in the presence of 
my God, to be judged of my b deeds.
16 And  now,  for  three  days  and 
for three nights was I racked, even 
with the a pains of a b damned soul.
17 And it came to pass that as I was 
thus a racked with torment, while I

was b harrowed up by the c memory 
of my many sins, behold, I d remem-
bered also to have heard my father 
prophesy unto the people concern-
ing the coming of one Jesus Christ, 
a Son of God, to atone for the sins 
of the world.

18 Now, as my mind caught hold 
upon  this  thought,  I  cried  within 
my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, 
a have mercy on me, who am b in the 
c gall of bitterness, and am encircled 
about by the everlasting d chains of  
e death.

19 And now, behold, when I thought  
this, I could remember my  a pains 
b no more; yea, I was harrowed up 
by the memory of my sins no more.
20 And  oh,  what  a joy,  and  what 
marvelous light I did behold; yea, 
my soul was filled with joy as ex-
ceeding as was my pain!

21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that 
there could be nothing so exquisite 
and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, 
and again I say unto you, my son, 
that on the other hand, there can 
be nothing so exquisite and sweet 
as was my joy.

22 Yea, methought I saw, even as 
our  father  a Lehi  saw,  God  sitting 
upon his throne, surrounded with 
numberless concourses of angels, in 
the attitude of singing and b prais-
ing their God; yea, and my soul did 
long to be there.

23 But behold, my limbs did receive 
their  a strength  again,  and  I  stood 
upon  my  feet,  and  did  manifest  

unto  the  people  that  I  had  been 
b born of God.

24 Yea, and from that time even 
until now, I have labored without 
ceasing,  that  I  might  bring  souls 
unto a repentance; that I might bring 
them to b taste of the exceeding joy 
of which I did taste; that they might 
also be c born of God, and be d filled 
with the Holy Ghost.

25 Yea,  and  now  behold,  O  my 
son, the Lord doth a give me exceed-
ingly great joy in the fruit of my  
b labors;

26 For because of the a word which 
he has imparted unto me, behold, 
many have been born of God, and 
have b tasted as I have tasted, and have  
seen eye to eye as I have seen; there-
fore they do know of these things of 
which I have spoken, as I do know;  
and  the  knowledge  which  I  have 
is of God.

27 And I have been supported un-
der trials and troubles of every kind, 
yea, and in all manner of afflictions;  
yea,  God  has  a delivered  me  from 
prison, and from bonds, and from 
death; yea, and I do put my trust in 
him, and he will still b deliver me.
28 And I know that he will a raise 
me up at the last day, to dwell with 
him in b glory; yea, and I will c praise 
him  forever,  for  he  has  d brought 
our  fathers  out  of  Egypt,  and  he 
has swallowed up the e Egyptians in 
the Red Sea; and he led them by his 
power into the promised land; yea, 
and he has delivered them out of

bondage  and  captivity  from  time 
to time.

29 Yea,  and  he  has  also  brought 
our fathers out of the land of Jeru-
salem; and he has also, by his ever-
lasting power, delivered them out of 
a bondage and captivity, from time 
to time even down to the present 
day; and I have always retained in 
remembrance their captivity; yea, 
and ye also ought to retain in re-
membrance, as I have done, their  
captivity.

30 But behold, my son, this is not 
all;  for  ye  ought  to  know  as  I  do 
know,  that  a inasmuch  as  ye  shall 
keep the commandments of God ye  
shall  b prosper in the land; and ye 
ought to know also, that inasmuch 
as ye will not keep the command-
ments of God ye shall be cut off from  
his presence. Now this is according 
to his word.

CHAPTER 37

The plates of brass and other scriptures 
are  preserved  to  bring  souls  to  salva-
tion—The  Jaredites  were  destroyed 
because  of  their  wickedness—Their 
secret  oaths  and  covenants  must  be 
kept  from  the  people—Counsel  with 
the  Lord  in  all  your  doings—As  the 
Liahona  guided  the  Nephites,  so  the 
word of Christ leads men to eternal life.  
About 74 b.c.
And now, my son Helaman, I com-
mand you that ye take the a records 
which have been b entrusted with me;
2 And I also command you that ye 
keep a a record of this people, accord-
ing as I have done, upon the plates 
of Nephi, and keep all these things 

sacred which I have kept, even as I 
have kept them; for it is for a b wise 
purpose that they are kept.

3 And these a plates of brass, which 
contain  these  engravings,  which 
have the records of the holy scrip-
tures  upon  them,  which  have  the 
b genealogy of our forefathers, even 
from the beginning—

4 Behold, it has been prophesied 
by our fathers, that they should be 
kept and a handed down from one 
generation to another, and be kept 
and preserved by the hand of the 
Lord until they should go forth unto 
every nation, kindred, tongue, and 
people, that they shall know of the 
b mysteries contained thereon.

5 And  now  behold,  if  they  are 
kept they must retain their bright-
ness; yea, and they will retain their 
brightness;  yea,  and  also  shall  all 
the  plates  which  do  contain  that 
which is holy writ.

6 Now ye may suppose that this is 
a foolishness in me; but behold I say 
unto you, that by  b small and sim-
ple things are great things brought 
to pass; and small means in many 
instances doth confound the wise.
7 And  the  Lord  God  doth  work 
by a means to bring about his great 
and eternal purposes; and by very 
b small means the Lord doth  c con-
found the wise and bringeth about 
the salvation of many souls.

8 And  now,  it  has  hitherto  been 
wisdom  in  God  that  these  things 
should  be  preserved;  for  behold, 
a they have  b enlarged the memory 
of this people, yea, and convinced 
many of the error of their ways, and 
brought them to the c knowledge of

their  God  unto  the  salvation  of 
their souls.

9 Yea, I say unto you, a were it not 
for these things that these records do 
contain, which are on these plates, 
Ammon and his brethren could not 
have b convinced so many thousands 
of  the  Lamanites  of  the  incorrect 
tradition of their fathers; yea, these 
records  and  their  c words  brought 
them unto repentance; that is, they 
brought them to the knowledge of 
the Lord their God, and to rejoice 
in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.

10 And  who  knoweth  but  what 
they will be the a means of bringing 
many thousands of them, yea, and 
also many thousands of our b stiff-
necked brethren, the Nephites, who 
are now hardening their hearts in 
sin and iniquities, to the knowledge 
of their Redeemer?

11 Now these mysteries are not yet 
fully made known unto me; there-
fore I shall forbear.

12 And  it  may  suffice  if  I  only 
say they are preserved for a a wise 
purpose, which purpose is known 
unto God; for he doth  b counsel in 
wisdom over all his works, and his 
paths are straight, and his course 
is c one eternal round.

13 O remember, remember, my son 
Helaman, how a strict are the com-
mandments of God. And he said: b If 
ye will keep my commandments ye 
shall  c prosper  in  the  land—but  if 
ye keep not his commandments ye 
shall be cut off from his presence.
14 And  now  remember,  my  son, 
that God has  a entrusted you with 
these  things,  which  are  b sacred, 
which he has kept sacred, and also 
which he will keep and  c preserve 
for a d wise purpose in him, that he 

may show forth his power unto fu-
ture generations.

15 And now behold, I tell you by 
the  spirit  of  prophecy,  that  if  ye 
transgress  the  commandments  of 
God,  behold,  these  things  which 
are sacred shall be taken away from 
you  by  the  power  of  God,  and  ye 
shall  be  delivered  up  unto  Satan, 
that he may sift you as chaff before  
the wind.

16 But if ye keep the command-
ments  of  God,  and  do  with  these 
things which are sacred according 
to that which the Lord doth com-
mand  you,  (for  you  must  appeal 
unto the Lord for all things whatso-
ever ye must do with them) behold, 
no power of earth or hell can a take 
them from you, for God is powerful 
to the fulfilling of all his words.

17 For he will fulfil all his a prom-
ises which he shall make unto you, 
for  he  has  fulfilled  his  promises 
which he has made unto our fathers.
18 For he promised unto them that 
he  would  a preserve  these  things 
for a wise purpose in him, that he 
might  show  forth  his  power  unto 
future generations.

19 And now behold, one purpose 
hath he fulfilled, even to the res-
toration of a many thousands of the  
Lamanites  to  the  knowledge  of  
the truth; and he hath shown forth 
his power in them, and he will also 
still show forth his power in them 
unto b future generations; therefore 
they shall be preserved.

20 Therefore I command you, my 
son Helaman, that ye be diligent in  
fulfilling all my words, and that ye  
be diligent in keeping the command-
ments of God as they are written.

you concerning those a twenty-four 
plates, that ye keep them, that the 
b mysteries and the works of dark-
ness, and their secret works, or the 
secret works of those people who 
have been destroyed, may be made 
c manifest unto this people; yea, all 
their  murders,  and  robbings,  and 
their  plunderings,  and  all  their 
wickedness and abominations, may 
be made manifest unto this people; 
yea, and that ye preserve these d in-
terpreters.

22 For behold, the Lord saw that 
his people began to work in dark-
ness, yea, work secret murders and 
abominations;  therefore  the  Lord 
said,  if  they  did  not  repent  they 
should  be  destroyed  from  off  the 
face of the earth.

23 And the Lord said: I will prepare  
unto my servant Gazelem, a a stone, 
which shall shine forth in darkness 
unto light, that I may b discover unto 
my  people  who  serve  me,  that  I 
may discover unto them the works 
of their brethren, yea, their secret 
works, their works of darkness, and 
their wickedness and abominations.
24 And now, my son, these a inter-
preters were prepared that the word 
of God might be fulfilled, which he 
spake, saying:

25 I will a bring forth out of dark-
ness unto light all their secret works 
and their abominations; and except 
they repent I will b destroy them from 
off the face of the earth; and I will 
bring to light all their secrets and 
abominations,  unto  every  nation  
that shall hereafter possess the land.
26 And now, my son, we see that 
they did not repent; therefore they 
have been destroyed, and thus far 
the word of God has been fulfilled; 

yea, their a secret abominations have 
been brought out of darkness and 
made known unto us.

27 And now, my son, I command 
you that ye retain all their oaths, 
and their covenants, and their agree-
ments in their secret abominations; 
yea, and all their  a signs and their 
wonders  ye  shall  b keep  from  this 
people, that they know them not, 
lest peradventure they should fall 
into darkness also and be destroyed.
28 For  behold,  there  is  a  a curse 
upon all this land, that destruction 
shall come upon all those workers 
of darkness, according to the power 
of  God,  when  they  are  fully  ripe; 
therefore I desire that this people 
might not be destroyed.

29 Therefore ye shall keep these 
secret  plans  of  their  a oaths  and 
their  covenants  from  this  people, 
and  only  their  wickedness  and 
their murders and their abomina-
tions  shall  ye  make  known  unto 
them;  and  ye  shall  teach  them  to 
b abhor such wickedness and abomi-
nations and murders; and ye shall 
also teach them that these people 
were destroyed on account of their 
wickedness and abominations and 
their murders.

30 For behold, they a murdered all 
the prophets of the Lord who came 
among them to declare unto them 
concerning  their  iniquities;  and 
the blood of those whom they mur-
dered did cry unto the Lord their 
God for vengeance upon those who 
were their murderers; and thus the 
judgments of God did come upon 
these workers of darkness and se-
cret b combinations.

31 Yea, and a cursed be the land for-
ever and ever unto those workers of

darkness and secret combinations, 
even unto destruction, except they 
repent before they are fully b ripe.
32 And  now,  my  son,  remember 
the words which I have spoken unto 
you;  trust  not  those  secret  plans 
unto  this  people,  but  teach  them 
an everlasting  a hatred against sin 
and iniquity.

33 a Preach unto them repentance, 
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; 
teach them to humble themselves 
and to be b meek and lowly in heart; 
teach  them  to  c withstand  every 
d temptation of the devil, with their 
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

34 Teach them to never be weary 
of good works, but to be meek and 
lowly in heart; for such shall find 
a rest to their souls.

35 O, remember, my son, and a learn 
b wisdom in thy  c youth; yea, learn 
in thy youth to keep the command-
ments of God.

36 Yea, and a cry unto God for all 
thy  support;  yea,  let  all  thy  b do-
ings be unto the Lord, and whith-
ersoever thou goest let it be in the 
Lord; yea, let all thy  c thoughts be 
directed unto the Lord; yea, let the 
affections  of  thy  heart  be  placed 
upon the Lord forever.

37 a Counsel  with  the  Lord  in  all 
thy doings, and he will direct thee 
for b good; yea, when thou liest down 
at  night  lie  down  unto  the  Lord, 
that he may watch over you in your 
sleep; and when thou risest in the 
c morning  let  thy  heart  be  full  of 
thanks unto God; and if ye do these 
things, ye shall be lifted up at the  
last day.

38 And  now,  my  son,  I  have  
somewhat  to  say  concerning  the 
thing which our fathers call a ball, 
or  director—or  our  fathers  called 
it a Liahona, which is, being inter-
preted,  a  compass;  and  the  Lord 
prepared it.

39 And behold, there cannot any 
man work after the manner of so 
curious  a  workmanship.  And  be-
hold, it was prepared to show unto 
our fathers the course which they 
should travel in the wilderness.

40 And  it  did  work  for  them  
according  to  their  a faith  in  God; 
therefore, if they had faith to be-
lieve  that  God  could  cause  that 
those  spindles  should  point  the 
way they should go, behold, it was 
done; therefore they had this mira-
cle, and also many other miracles 
wrought by the power of God, day  
by day.

41 Nevertheless,  because  those 
miracles  were  worked  by  a small 
means it did show unto them mar-
velous works. They were b slothful, 
and  forgot  to  exercise  their  faith 
and diligence and then those mar-
velous works ceased, and they did 
not progress in their journey;

42 Therefore, they tarried in the 
wilderness, or did a not travel a di-
rect course, and were afflicted with 
hunger and thirst, because of their 
transgressions.

43 And now, my son, I would that 
ye  should  understand  that  these 
things are not without a a shadow; 
for as our fathers were slothful to 
give  heed  to  this  compass  (now 
these  things  were  temporal)  they

did not prosper; even so it is with 
things which are spiritual.

44 For behold, it is as easy to give 
heed to the a word of Christ, which 
will point to you a straight course to 
eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers 
to give heed to this compass, which 
would point unto them a straight 
course to the promised land.

45 And  now  I  say,  is  there  not 
a  a type  in  this  thing?  For  just  as 
surely as this director did bring our 
fathers, by following its course, to 
the promised land, shall the words 
of Christ, if we follow their course, 
carry us beyond this vale of sorrow 
into a far better land of promise.

46 O  my  son,  do  not  let  us  be 
a slothful  because  of  the  b easiness 
of the c way; for so was it with our 
fathers; for so was it prepared for 
them, that if they would d look they 
might  e live;  even  so  it  is  with  us. 
The way is prepared, and if we will 
look we may live forever.

47 And now, my son, see that ye 
take  a care  of  these  sacred  things, 
yea,  see  that  ye  b look  to  God  and 
live.  Go  unto  this  people  and  de-
clare  the  word,  and  be  sober.  My 
son, farewell.

The commandments of Alma to his 
son Shiblon.

Comprising chapter 38.

CHAPTER 38

Shiblon was persecuted for righteous-
ness’ sake—Salvation is in Christ, who 

is the life and the light of the world—
Bridle all your passions. About 74 b.c.
My a son, give ear to my words, for 
I say unto you, even as I said unto 
Helaman, that b inasmuch as ye shall 
keep  the  commandments  of  God 
ye  shall  prosper  in  the  land;  and 
inasmuch as ye will not keep the 
commandments of God ye shall be 
c cut off from his d presence.

2 And now, my son, I trust that I 
shall have great joy in you, because 
of your a steadiness and your faith-
fulness unto God; for as you have 
commenced in your youth to look 
to the Lord your God, even so I hope 
that you will continue in keeping 
his commandments; for blessed is 
he that b endureth to the end.

3 I  say  unto  you,  my  son,  that  I 
have had great joy in thee already, 
because of thy faithfulness and thy  
diligence,  and  thy  patience  and  
thy long-suffering among the peo-
ple of the a Zoramites.

4 For  I  know  that  thou  wast  in 
bonds;  yea,  and  I  also  know  that 
thou wast stoned for the word’s sake; 
and thou didst bear all these things 
with a patience because the Lord was  
b with thee; and now thou knowest 
that the Lord did deliver thee.

5 And  now  my  son,  Shiblon,  I 
would that ye should remember, that 
as much as ye shall put your a trust 
in God even so much ye shall be b de-
livered out of your trials, and your  
c troubles, and your afflictions, and 
ye shall be lifted up at the last day.
6 Now, my son, I would not that ye  
should  think  that  I  know  these

things of myself, but it is the Spirit 
of God which is in me which mak-
eth  these  things  known  unto  me; 
for if I had not been a born of God I 
should not have known these things.
7 But behold, the Lord in his great 
mercy  sent  his  a angel  to  declare 
unto me that I must stop the work 
of  b destruction among his people; 
yea, and I have seen an angel face 
to face, and he spake with me, and 
his  voice  was  as  thunder,  and  it 
shook the whole earth.

8 And it came to pass that I was 
a three  days  and  three  nights  in 
the most bitter b pain and c anguish 
of soul; and never, until I did cry 
out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for 
mercy, did I receive a d remission of 
my sins. But behold, I did cry unto 
him and I did find peace to my soul.
9 And  now,  my  son,  I  have  told 
you  this  that  ye  may  learn  wis-
dom, that ye may learn of me that 
there  is  a no  other  way  or  means 
whereby man can be saved, only in 
and through Christ. Behold, he is 
the life and the b light of the world. 
Behold, he is the word of truth and  
c righteousness.

10 And now, as ye have begun to 
teach the word even so I would that 
ye should continue to teach; and I 
would  that  ye  would  be  diligent 
and a temperate in all things.

11 See  that  ye  are  not  lifted  up 
unto pride; yea, see that ye do not 
a boast in your own wisdom, nor of 
your much strength.

12 Use a boldness, but not overbear-
ance;  and  also  see  that  ye  b bridle 
all  your  passions,  that  ye  may  be 
filled with love; see that ye refrain 
from idleness.

13 Do not a pray as the Zoramites 
do, for ye have seen that they pray to 
be heard of men, and to be praised 
for their wisdom.

14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee 
that we are a better than our breth-
ren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive 
my b unworthiness, and remember 
my  brethren  in  mercy—yea,  ac-
knowledge your unworthiness be-
fore God at all times.

15 And may the Lord bless your 
soul, and receive you at the last day 
into  his  kingdom,  to  sit  down  in 
peace. Now go, my son, and teach 
the word unto this people. Be a so-
ber. My son, farewell.

anton’s  sins  kept  the  Zoramites  from

preceded it. About 74 b.c.
And now, my a son, I have somewhat 
more to say unto thee than what I 
said unto thy brother; for behold, 
have ye not observed the steadiness 
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and 
his diligence in keeping the com-
mandments of God? Behold, has he 
not set a good b example for thee?

2 For thou didst not give so much 
heed  unto  my  words  as  did  thy 
brother,  among  the  people  of  the 
a Zoramites. Now this is what I have 
against thee; thou didst go on unto

boasting  in  thy  strength  and  thy 
wisdom.

3 And this is not all, my son. Thou 
didst  do  that  which  was  grievous 
unto me; for thou didst forsake the 
ministry, and did go over into the 
land  of  Siron  among  the  borders 
of the Lamanites, after the a harlot 
Isabel.

4 Yea,  she  did  a steal  away  the 
hearts of many; but this was no ex-
cuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst 
have tended to the ministry where-
with thou wast entrusted.

5 Know ye not, my son, that these 
things  are  an  abomination  in  the 
sight of the Lord; yea, most a abomi-
nable above all sins save it be the 
shedding of innocent b blood or de-
nying the Holy Ghost?

6 For behold, if ye a deny the Holy 
Ghost when it once has had place 
in you, and ye know that ye deny 
it,  behold,  this  is  a  sin  which  is 
b unpardonable; yea, and whosoever 
murdereth  against  the  light  and 
knowledge of God, it is not easy for 
him  to  obtain  c forgiveness;  yea,  I 
say unto you, my son, that it is not 
easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.
7 And now, my son, I would to God 
that ye had not been a guilty of so 
great  a  crime.  I  would  not  dwell 
upon  your  crimes,  to  harrow  up 
your  soul,  if  it  were  not  for  your  
good.

8 But behold, ye cannot a hide your 
crimes from God; and except ye re-
pent they will stand as a testimony 
against you at the last day.

9 Now  my  son,  I  would  that  ye 

should repent and forsake your sins, 
and go no more after the a lusts of 
your eyes, but b cross yourself in all 
these things; for except ye do this ye 
can in nowise inherit the kingdom 
of God. Oh, remember, and take it 
upon  you,  and  c cross  yourself  in 
these things.

10 And I command you to take it 
upon you to counsel with your elder 
brothers in your undertakings; for 
behold, thou art in thy youth, and 
ye stand in need to be nourished 
by your brothers. And give heed to 
their counsel.

11 Suffer  not  yourself  to  be  led 
away by any vain or foolish thing; 
suffer  not  the  devil  to  lead  away 
your heart again after those wicked 
harlots.  Behold,  O  my  son,  how 
great a iniquity ye brought upon the 
b Zoramites; for when they saw your 
c conduct they would not believe in  
my words.

12 And now the Spirit of the Lord 
doth say unto me: a Command thy 
children to do good, lest they b lead 
away the hearts of many people to 
destruction; therefore I command 
you, my son, in the fear of God, that 
ye c refrain from your iniquities;

13 That ye turn to the Lord with 
all your mind, might, and strength; 
that ye lead away the hearts of no 
more to do wickedly; but rather re-
turn unto them, and a acknowledge 
your faults and that wrong which 
ye have done.

14 a Seek not after riches nor the 
vain things of this world; for behold, 
you cannot carry them with you.

ALMA 39  : 15–40  : 8

15 And now, my son, I would say 
somewhat unto you concerning the 
a coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto 
you, that it is he that surely shall 
come to take away the sins of the 
world; yea, he cometh to declare glad  
tidings of salvation unto his people.
16 And now, my son, this was the 
ministry unto which ye were called, 
to declare these glad tidings unto 
this people, to prepare their minds; 
or rather that salvation might come 
unto them, that they may prepare 
the  minds  of  their  a children  to 
hear  the  word  at  the  time  of  his  
coming.

17 And now I will ease your mind 
somewhat on this subject. Behold, 
you marvel why these things should 
be known so long beforehand. Be-
hold, I say unto you, is not a soul 
at this time as precious unto God 
as a soul will be at the time of his 
coming?

18 Is it not as necessary that the 
plan of redemption should be a made 
known unto this people as well as 
unto their children?

19 Is it not as easy at this time for 
the Lord to  a send his angel to de-
clare these glad tidings unto us as 
unto  our  children,  or  as  after  the 
time of his coming?

CHAPTER 40
Christ brings to pass the resurrection 
of all men—The righteous dead go to 
paradise and the wicked to outer dark-
ness  to  await  the  day  of  their  resur-
rection—All things will be restored to 
their  proper  and  perfect  frame  in  the 
Resurrection. About 74 b.c.
Now my son, here is somewhat more 
I would say unto thee; for I perceive 

that thy mind is worried concern-
ing the resurrection of the dead.

2 Behold, I say unto you, that there 
is no resurrection—or, I would say, 
in  other  words,  that  this  mortal 
does not put on a immortality, this 
corruption does not b put on incor-
ruption—c until after the coming of  
Christ.

3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the 
a resurrection of the dead. But be-
hold, my son, the resurrection is not 
yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mys-
tery; nevertheless, there are many 
b mysteries which are c kept, that no 
one knoweth them save God him-
self. But I show unto you one thing 
which  I  have  inquired  diligently 
of God that I might know—that is 
concerning the resurrection.

4 Behold, there is a time appointed 
that all shall a come forth from the 
dead. Now when this time cometh 
no one knows; but God knoweth the 
time which is appointed.

5 Now, whether there shall be one 
time, or a a second time, or a third 
time,  that  men  shall  come  forth 
from  the  dead,  it  mattereth  not; 
for God b knoweth all these things; 
and  it  sufficeth  me  to  know  that 
this is the case—that there is a time 
appointed that all shall rise from  
the dead.

6 Now there must needs be a space 
betwixt the time of death and the 
time of the resurrection.

7 And now I would inquire what 
becometh of the a souls of men b from 
this time of death to the time ap-
pointed for the resurrection?

8 Now whether there is more than 
one a time appointed for men to rise 
it mattereth not; for all do not die at 
once, and this mattereth not; all is

as one day with God, and time only 
is measured unto men.

9 Therefore,  there  is  a  time  ap-
pointed unto men that they shall 
rise from the dead; and there is a 
space  between  the  time  of  death 
and  the  resurrection.  And  now, 
concerning this space of time, what 
becometh of the souls of men is the 
thing  which  I  have  inquired  dili-
gently  of  the  Lord  to  know;  and 
this is the thing of which I do know.
10 And  when  the  time  cometh 
when all shall rise, then shall they 
know  that  God  a knoweth  all  the 
b times  which  are  appointed  unto 
man.

11 Now, concerning the  a state of 
the  soul  between  b death  and  the 
resurrection—Behold,  it  has  been 
made known unto me by an angel, 
that the spirits of all men, as soon 
as they are departed from this mor-
tal body, yea, the spirits of all men, 
whether they be good or evil, are 
c taken d home to that God who gave 
them life.

12 And then shall it come to pass, 
that  the  spirits  of  those  who  are 
righteous are received into a state  
of  a happiness,  which  is  called 
b paradise, a state of rest, a state of 
c peace, where they shall rest from 
all their troubles and from all care, 
and sorrow.

13 And then shall it come to pass, 
that the a spirits of the wicked, yea, 
who are evil—for behold, they have 
no part nor portion of the Spirit of 
the Lord; for behold, they chose evil 
works rather than good; therefore 

the spirit of the b devil did enter into 
them, and take possession of their 
house—and these shall be cast out 
into c outer darkness; there shall be 
d weeping, and wailing, and gnashing 
of teeth, and this because of their 
own iniquity, being led captive by 
the will of the devil.

14 Now  this  is  the  state  of  the 
a souls of the b wicked, yea, in dark-
ness, and a state of awful, c fearful 
looking for the fiery d indignation of 
the wrath of God upon them; thus 
they remain in this  e state, as well 
as the righteous in paradise, until 
the time of their resurrection.

15 Now, there are some that have 
understood that this state of happi-
ness and this state of misery of the 
soul,  before  the  resurrection,  was 
a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it 
may be termed a resurrection, the 
a raising of the spirit or the soul and 
their  consignation  to  happiness 
or misery, according to the words 
which have been spoken.

16 And behold, again it hath been 
spoken, that there is a a first b resur-
rection, a resurrection of all those 
who have been, or who are, or who 
shall be, down to the resurrection 
of Christ from the dead.

17 Now,  we  do  not  suppose  that 
this first resurrection, which is spo-
ken of in this manner, can be the 
resurrection of the souls and their 
a consignation to happiness or mis-
ery. Ye cannot suppose that this is 
what it meaneth.

18 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Nay; 
but it meaneth the a reuniting of the

soul with the body, of those from 
the days of Adam down to the res-
urrection of Christ.

19 Now, whether the souls and the 
bodies of those of whom has been 
spoken shall all be reunited at once, 
the wicked as well as the righteous, 
I do not say; let it suffice, that I say 
that they all come forth; or in other 
words,  their  resurrection  cometh 
to pass a before the resurrection of 
those  who  die  after  the  resurrec-
tion of Christ.

20 Now, my son, I do not say that 
their resurrection cometh at the res-
urrection of Christ; but behold, I give 
it as my opinion, that the souls and  
the bodies are reunited, of the righ-
teous, at the resurrection of Christ, 
and his a ascension into heaven.

21 But whether it be at his resur-
rection or after, I do not say; but this 
much  I  say,  that  there  is  a  a space 
between death and the resurrection 
of the body, and a state of the soul 
in  b happiness  or  in  c misery  until 
the time which is appointed of God 
that the dead shall come forth, and 
be  reunited,  both  soul  and  body, 
and  be  d brought  to  stand  before 
God,  and  be  judged  according  to 
their works.

22 Yea,  this  bringeth  about  the 
restoration of those things of which 
has been spoken by the mouths of 
the prophets.

23 The a soul shall be b restored to 
the c body, and the body to the soul; 
yea, and every limb and joint shall 
be restored to its body; yea, even a 
d hair of the head shall not be lost; 
but all things shall be restored to 
their proper and e perfect frame.

24 And now, my son, this is the res-
toration of which has been a spoken 
by the mouths of the prophets—

25 And then shall the  a righteous 
shine forth in the kingdom of God.
26 But  behold,  an  awful  a death 
cometh upon the wicked; for they 
die as to things pertaining to things 
of  righteousness;  for  they  are  un-
clean,  and  b no  unclean  thing  can 
inherit  the  kingdom  of  God;  but 
they are cast out, and consigned to 
partake of the fruits of their labors 
or  their  works,  which  have  been 
evil; and they drink the dregs of a  
bitter c cup.

CHAPTER 41
In the Resurrection men come forth to 
a state of endless happiness or endless 
misery—Wickedness never was happi-
ness—Carnal men are without God in 
the world—Every person receives again 
in  the  Restoration  the  characteristics 
and  attributes  acquired  in  mortality. 
About 74 b.c.
And now, my son, I have somewhat 
to say concerning the restoration of 
which has been spoken; for behold, 
some have a wrested the scriptures, 
and have gone far b astray because 
of this thing. And I perceive that 
thy  mind  has  been  c worried  also 
concerning this thing. But behold, 
I will explain it unto thee.

2 I say unto thee, my son, that the 
plan of restoration is requisite with 
the justice of God; for it is requisite 
that all things should be restored 
to their proper order. Behold, it is 
requisite and just, according to the 
power and resurrection of Christ,

that the soul of man should be re-
stored to its body, and that every 
a part of the body should be restored 
to itself.

3 And it is requisite with the a jus-
tice  of  God  that  men  should  be 
b judged according to their c works; 
and if their works were good in this 
life, and the desires of their hearts 
were good, that they should also, at 
the last day, be d restored unto that 
which is good.

4 And if their works are evil they 
shall be a restored unto them for evil. 
Therefore,  all  things  shall  be  b re-
stored to their proper order, every 
thing to its natural frame—c mortality 
raised to d immortality, e corruption 
to incorruption—raised to f endless  
happiness to g inherit the kingdom 
of God, or to endless misery to in-
herit the kingdom of the devil, the 
one on one hand, the other on the 
other—

5 The one raised to a happiness ac-
cording to his desires of happiness, 
or good according to his desires of 
good; and the other to evil according 
to his desires of evil; for as he has 
desired to do evil all the day long 
even so shall he have his reward of 
evil when the night cometh.

6 And so it is on the other hand. 
If he hath repented of his sins, and 
desired righteousness until the end 
of his days, even so he shall be re-
warded unto righteousness.

7 a These are they that are redeemed 
of the Lord; yea, these are they that 
are taken out, that are delivered from  

that endless night of darkness; and 
thus they stand or fall; for behold, 
they are their own b judges, whether 
to do good or do evil.

8 Now,  the  decrees  of  God  are 
a unalterable; therefore, the way is 
prepared that b whosoever will may 
c walk therein and be saved.

9 And now behold, my son, do not 
risk a one more offense against your 
God upon those points of doctrine, 
which  ye  have  hitherto  risked  to 
commit sin.

10 Do not suppose, because it has 
been spoken concerning restoration, 
that ye shall be restored from sin to 
happiness. Behold, I say unto you, 
a wickedness never was b happiness.
11 And now, my son, all men that 
are in a state of a nature, or I would 
say, in a b carnal state, are in the c gall 
of bitterness and in the d bonds of 
iniquity; they are e without God in 
the world, and they have gone f con-
trary to the nature of God; there-
fore, they are in a state contrary to 
the nature of happiness.

12 And now behold, is the meaning  
of  the  word  restoration  to  take  a 
thing of a natural state and place it  
in an unnatural state, or to place 
it in a state opposite to its nature?
13 O, my son, this is not the case; 
but the meaning of the word resto-
ration is to bring back again a evil  
for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devil-
ish for devilish—good for that which 
is good; righteous for that which is 
righteous; just for that which is just; 
merciful for that which is merciful.

14 Therefore, my son, see that you 
are  merciful  unto  your  brethren; 
deal a justly, b judge righteously, and 
do c good continually; and if ye do 
all these things then shall ye receive 
your  d reward;  yea,  ye  shall  have 
e mercy  restored  unto  you  again; 
ye shall have justice restored unto 
you again; ye shall have a righteous 
judgment restored unto you again; 
and  ye  shall  have  good  rewarded 
unto you again.

15 For that which ye do a send out 
shall return unto you again, and be 
restored;  therefore,  the  word  res-
toration  more  fully  condemneth 
the sinner, and justifieth him not  
at all.

CHAPTER 42
Mortality is a probationary time to en-
able man to repent and serve God—The 
Fall  brought  temporal  and  spiritual 
death upon all mankind—Redemption  
comes through repentance—God Himself 
atones for the sins of the world—Mercy  
is for those who repent—All others are 
subject to God’s justice—Mercy comes 
because  of  the  Atonement—Only  the 
truly penitent are saved. About 74 b.c.
And now, my son, I perceive there 
is  somewhat  more  which  doth 
worry your mind, which ye cannot 
understand—which is concerning 
the a justice of God in the b punish-
ment  of  the  sinner;  for  ye  do  try 
to suppose that it is c injustice that 
the sinner should be consigned to 
a state of misery.

2 Now behold, my son, I will explain 
this  thing  unto  thee.  For  behold,  
after  the  Lord  God  sent  our  first 

parents  forth  from  the  garden  of 
a Eden,  to  till  the  b ground,  from 
whence they were taken—yea, he 
drew out the man, and he placed at 
the east end of the garden of Eden, 
c cherubim,  and  a  flaming  sword 
which turned every way, to keep the  
tree of life—

3 Now, we see that the man had 
become as God, knowing good and 
evil;  and  lest  he  should  put  forth 
his hand, and take also of the tree 
of life, and eat and live forever, the 
Lord God placed a cherubim and the 
flaming sword, that he should not 
partake of the fruit—

4 And thus we see, that there was 
a a time granted unto man to repent, 
yea, a b probationary time, a time to 
repent and serve God.

5 For behold, if Adam had put forth 
his  hand  immediately,  and  a par-
taken of the b tree of life, he would 
have lived forever, according to the 
word of God, having no space for 
repentance; yea, and also the word 
of God would have been void, and 
the great plan of salvation would 
have been frustrated.

6 But  behold,  it  was  appointed 
unto  man  to  a die—therefore,  as 
they were cut off from the tree of 
life  they  should  be  cut  off  from 
the face of the earth—and man be-
came b lost forever, yea, they became  
c fallen man.

7 And  now,  ye  see  by  this  that 
our first parents were a cut off both 
temporally and spiritually from the 
b presence of the Lord; and thus we 
see they became subjects to follow 
after their own c will.

that man should be reclaimed from 
this a temporal death, for that would 
destroy the great b plan of happiness.
9 Therefore, as the soul could never 
die, and the a fall had brought upon 
all  mankind  a  spiritual  b death  as 
well  as  a  temporal,  that  is,  they 
were  cut  off  from  the  presence 
of the Lord, it was expedient that 
mankind should be reclaimed from 
this spiritual death.

10 Therefore, as they had become 
a carnal,  sensual,  and  devilish,  by 
b nature, this c probationary state be-
came a state for them to prepare; it 
became a preparatory state.

11 And  now  remember,  my  son, 
if  it  were  not  for  the  plan  of  re-
demption, (laying it aside) as soon 
as they were dead their souls were 
a miserable, being cut off from the 
presence of the Lord.

12 And now, there was no means 
to  reclaim  men  from  this  fallen 
state,  which  a man  had  brought 
upon  himself  because  of  his  own 
b disobedience;

13 Therefore, according to justice, 
the a plan of b redemption could not 
be  brought  about,  only  on  condi-
tions of repentance of men in this 
probationary state, yea, this prepar-
atory state; for except it were for 
these conditions, mercy could not 
take effect except it should destroy 
the work of justice. Now the work 
of justice could not be destroyed; 
if so, God would c cease to be God.
14 And thus we see that all man-
kind were a fallen, and they were in 

the grasp of b justice; yea, the justice 
of God, which consigned them for-
ever to be cut off from his presence.
15 And  now,  the  plan  of  mercy 
could not be brought about except 
an  atonement  should  be  made; 
therefore God himself a atoneth for 
the sins of the world, to bring about 
the plan of b mercy, to appease the 
demands of  c justice, that God might 
be a d perfect, just God, and a e mer-
ciful God also.

16 Now, repentance could not come 
unto men except there were a a pun-
ishment, which also was b eternal as 
the  life  of  the  soul  should  be,  af-
fixed c opposite to the plan of hap-
piness, which was as d eternal also 
as the life of the soul.

17 Now, how could a man repent 
except he should a sin? How could 
he  sin  if  there  was  no  b law?  How 
could there be a law save there was 
a punishment?

18 Now, there was a punishment 
affixed, and a just law given, which 
brought  remorse  of  a conscience 
unto man.

19 Now, if there was no law given—
if a man a murdered he should b die—
would he be afraid he would die if 
he should murder?

20 And also, if there was no law 
given  against  sin  men  would  not 
be afraid to sin.

21 And if there was a no law given, 
if  men  sinned  what  could  justice 
do, or mercy either, for they would 
have no claim upon the creature?

22 But there is a law given, and a

a punishment affixed, and a b repen-
tance  granted;  which  repentance, 
mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice 
claimeth the creature and executeth 
the c law, and the law inflicteth the 
punishment;  if  not  so,  the  works 
of justice would be destroyed, and 
God would cease to be God.

23 But God ceaseth not to be God, 
and a mercy claimeth the penitent, 
and mercy cometh because of the 
b atonement;  and  the  atonement 
bringeth to pass the c resurrection of  
the  dead;  and  the  d resurrection 
of  the  dead  bringeth  e back  men 
into the presence of God; and thus 
they are restored into his presence, 
to  be  f judged  according  to  their 
works,  according  to  the  law  and  
justice.

24 For behold, justice exerciseth 
all  his  demands,  and  also  a mercy 
claimeth all which is her own; and 
thus,  none  but  the  truly  penitent 
are saved.

25 What, do ye suppose that a mercy 
can  rob  b justice?  I  say  unto  you, 
Nay; not one whit. If so, God would 
cease to be God.

26 And thus God bringeth about 
his  great  and  eternal  a purposes, 
which  were  prepared  b from  the 
foundation of the world. And thus 
cometh about the salvation and the 
redemption of men, and also their 
destruction and misery.

27 Therefore, O my son,  a whoso-
ever will come may come and par-
take  of  the  waters  of  life  freely; 
and whosoever will not come the 
same is not compelled to come; but 

in the last day it shall be b restored 
unto him according to his c deeds.

28 If  he  has  desired  to  do  a evil, 
and has not repented in his days, 
behold, evil shall be done unto him, 
according to the restoration of God.
29 And now, my son, I desire that 
ye should let these things a trouble 
you  no  more,  and  only  let  your 
sins trouble you, with that trouble 
which shall bring you down unto 
repentance.

30 O my son, I desire that ye should 
deny the a justice of God no more. Do 
not endeavor to excuse yourself in 
the least point because of your sins, 
by denying the justice of God; but 
do you let the justice of God, and 
his b mercy, and his long-suffering 
have full sway in your heart; and 
let  it  bring  you  down  to  the  dust 
in c humility.

31 And  now,  O  my  son,  ye  are 
called of God to a preach the word 
unto this people. And now, my son, 
go thy way, declare the word with 
truth and soberness, that thou may-
est  b bring  souls  unto  repentance, 
that the great plan of mercy may 
have  claim  upon  them.  And  may 
God grant unto you even according 
to my words. Amen.

reveals to Alma the strategy of the La-
manites—The  Nephites  defend  their 
homes,  liberties,  families,  and  reli-
gion—The armies of Moroni and Lehi 
surround the Lamanites. About 74 b.c.

And now it came to pass that the 
sons  of  Alma  did  go  forth  among 
the  people,  to  declare  the  word 
unto them. And Alma, also, himself, 
could  not  a rest,  and  he  also  went  
forth.

2 Now a we shall say no more con-
cerning  their  preaching,  except 
that they preached the word, and 
the  truth,  according  to  the  spirit 
of  prophecy  and  revelation;  and 
they preached after the b holy order 
of God by which they were called.
3 And now a I return to an b account 
of the wars between the Nephites 
and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth 
year of the reign of the judges.

4 For behold, it came to pass that 
the a Zoramites became Lamanites; 
therefore,  in  the  commencement  
of the eighteenth year the people of  
the Nephites saw that the Lamanites 
were coming upon them; therefore 
they  made  preparations  for  war; 
yea,  they  gathered  together  their 
armies in the land of Jershon.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  came  with  their  thou-
sands; and they came into the land 
of a Antionum, which is the land of 
the  Zoramites;  and  a  man  by  the 
name  of  b Zerahemnah  was  their  
leader.

6 And  now,  as  the  a Amalekites 
were  of  a  more  wicked  and  mur-
derous  disposition  than  the  La-
manites were, in and of themselves, 
therefore, Zerahemnah appointed 
chief b captains over the Lamanites, 

and they were all Amalekites and  
c Zoramites.

7 Now this he did that he might 
preserve their a hatred towards the 
Nephites, that he might bring them 
into subjection to the accomplish-
ment of his designs.

8 For  behold,  his  a designs  were 
to b stir up the Lamanites to anger 
against  the  Nephites;  this  he  did 
that  he  might  usurp  great  power 
over them, and also that he might 
gain  power  over  the  Nephites  by 
bringing them into c bondage.

9 And now the design of the Neph-
ites was to support their lands, and  
their  houses,  and  their  a wives,  
and their children, that they might 
preserve  them  from  the  hands  of 
their  enemies;  and  also  that  they 
might  preserve  their  b rights  and 
their privileges, yea, and also their 
c liberty,  that  they  might  worship 
God according to their desires.

10 For  they  knew  that  if  they 
should  fall  into  the  hands  of  the 
Lamanites, that whosoever should 
a worship God in b spirit and in truth, 
the true and the living God, the La-
manites would c destroy.

11 Yea,  and  they  also  knew  the 
extreme  hatred  of  the  Lamanites 
towards their a brethren, who were 
the  b people  of  Anti-Nephi-Lehi, 
who were called the people of Am-
mon—and they would not take up 
arms, yea, they had entered into a 
covenant and they would not break 
it—therefore,  if  they  should  fall 
into  the  hands  of  the  Lamanites 
they would be destroyed.

12 And the Nephites would not suf-
fer that they should be destroyed; 
therefore they gave them lands for 
their inheritance.

ALMA 43  : 13–24

13 And the people of Ammon did 
give unto the Nephites a large por-
tion of their substance to a support 
their armies; and thus the Nephites 
were compelled, alone, to withstand 
against the Lamanites, who were a 
compound of Laman and Lemuel, 
and  the  sons  of  Ishmael,  and  all 
those who had dissented from the 
Nephites, who were Amalekites and 
Zoramites, and the b descendants of 
the priests of Noah.

14 Now  those  descendants  were 
as  numerous,  nearly,  as  were  the 
Nephites;  and  thus  the  Nephites 
were obliged to contend with their 
brethren, even unto bloodshed.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  as  the 
armies of the Lamanites had gath-
ered together in the land of Antio-
num,  behold,  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites  were  prepared  to  meet 
them in the a land of Jershon.

16 Now,  the  leader  of  the  Neph-
ites, or the man who had been a ap-
pointed  to  be  the  b chief  captain 
over  the  Nephites—now  the  chief 
captain  took  the  command  of  all 
the  armies  of  the  Nephites—and 
his name was Moroni;

17 And Moroni took all the com-
mand, and the government of their 
wars.  And  he  was  only  twenty 
and  five  years  old  when  he  was 
appointed  chief  captain  over  the 
armies of the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that he met 
the Lamanites in the borders of Jer-
shon,  and  his  people  were  armed 
with  swords,  and  with  cimeters, 
and all manner of  a weapons of war.
19 And  when  the  armies  of  the 
Lamanites saw that the people of 
Nephi,  or  that  Moroni,  had  a pre-
pared his people with b breastplates 
and with arm-shields, yea, and also 
shields to defend their heads, and 

also they were dressed with thick 
clothing—

20 Now the army of Zerahemnah 
was  not  prepared  with  any  such 
thing; they had only their a swords 
and their cimeters, their bows and 
their arrows, their b stones and their 
slings; and they were c naked, save 
it  were  a  skin  which  was  girded 
about their loins; yea, all were na-
ked, save it were the Zoramites and 
the Amalekites;

21 But they were not armed with 
breastplates, nor shields—therefore, 
they were exceedingly afraid of the 
armies of the Nephites because of 
their armor, notwithstanding their 
number being so much greater than 
the Nephites.

22 Behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  they  durst  not  come  against 
the Nephites in the borders of Jer-
shon; therefore they departed out 
of the land of Antionum into the 
wilderness, and took their journey 
round about in the wilderness, away 
by the head of the river Sidon, that 
they might come into the land of 
a Manti and take possession of the 
land; for they did not suppose that 
the armies of Moroni would know 
whither they had gone.

23 But it came to pass, as soon as 
they had departed into the wilder-
ness Moroni sent spies into the wil-
derness to watch their camp; and 
Moroni, also, knowing of the prophe-
cies of Alma, sent certain men unto 
him,  desiring  him  that  he  should 
a inquire of the Lord  b whither the 
armies  of  the  Nephites  should  go 
to  defend  themselves  against  the 
Lamanites.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a word of the Lord came unto Alma, 
and Alma informed the messengers 
of  Moroni,  that  the  armies  of  the

Lamanites  were  marching  round 
about in the wilderness, that they 
might come over into the land of 
Manti, that they might commence 
an attack upon the weaker part of 
the people. And those messengers 
went  and  delivered  the  message 
unto Moroni.

25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of 
his  army  in  the  land  of  Jershon, 
lest  by  any  means  a  part  of  the 
Lamanites  should  come  into  that 
land and take possession of the city, 
took the remaining part of his army 
and  marched  over  into  the  land  
of Manti.

26 And  he  caused  that  all  the 
people in that quarter of the land 
should gather themselves together 
to battle against the Lamanites, to 
defend their lands and their coun-
try,  their  rights  and  their  liber-
ties; therefore they were prepared 
against the time of the coming of 
the Lamanites.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni  caused  that  his  army  should 
be secreted in the valley which was 
near  the  bank  of  the  river  Sidon, 
which was on the west of the river 
Sidon in the wilderness.

28 And Moroni placed spies round 
about,  that  he  might  know  when 
the camp of the Lamanites should  
come.

29 And now, as Moroni knew the 
a intention of the Lamanites, that it 
was their intention to destroy their 
brethren, or to  b subject them and 
bring them into bondage that they 
might  establish  a  kingdom  unto 
themselves over all the land;

30 And  he  also  knowing  that  it 
was the a only desire of the Nephites 
to preserve their lands, and their 
b liberty, and their church, therefore 
he thought it no sin that he should 
defend them by c stratagem; there-
fore, he found by his spies which 
course the Lamanites were to take.

31 Therefore, he divided his army 
and  brought  a  part  over  into  the 
valley, and a concealed them on the 
east,  and  on  the  south  of  the  hill  
Riplah;

32 And the remainder he concealed 
in the west a valley, on the west of  
the river Sidon, and so down into 
the borders of the land Manti.

33 And  thus  having  placed  his 
army  according  to  his  desire,  he 
was prepared to meet them.

34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites came up on the north of 
the hill, where a part of the army 
of Moroni was concealed.

35 And  as  the  Lamanites  had 
passed  the  hill  Riplah,  and  came 
into the valley, and began to cross 
the  river  Sidon,  the  army  which 
was concealed on the south of the 
hill, which was led by a man whose 
name was a Lehi, and he led his army 
forth and encircled the Lamanites 
about on the east in their rear.

36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites, when they saw the Neph-
ites  coming  upon  them  in  their 
rear, turned them about and began 
to contend with the army of Lehi.
37 And  the  work  of  death  com-
menced  on  both  sides,  but  it  was 
more  dreadful  on  the  part  of  the 
Lamanites,  for  their  a nakedness 
was  exposed  to  the  heavy  blows 
of the Nephites with their swords 
and their cimeters, which brought 
death almost at every stroke.

38 While on the other hand, there 
was now and then a man fell among 
the Nephites, by their swords and  
the loss of blood, they being shielded 
from  the  more  vital  parts  of  the 
body,  or  the  more  vital  parts  of 
the body being shielded from the 
strokes of the Lamanites, by their 
a breastplates, and their armshields, 
and their head-plates; and thus the 
Nephites did carry on the work of 
death among the Lamanites.

39 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites became frightened, be-
cause of the great destruction among 
them, even until they began to flee 
towards the river Sidon.

40 And they were pursued by Lehi 
and his men; and they were driven 
by  Lehi  into  the  waters  of  Sidon, 
and they crossed the waters of Si-
don. And Lehi retained his armies 
upon the bank of the river Sidon 
that they should not cross.

41 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and his army met the Lamanites in 
the a valley, on the other side of the 
river Sidon, and began to fall upon 
them and to slay them.

42 And  the  Lamanites  did  flee 
again before them, towards the land 
of Manti; and they were met again 
by the armies of Moroni.

43 Now in this case the Lamanites 
did  fight  exceedingly;  yea,  never 
had the Lamanites been known to 
fight with such exceedingly great 
strength and courage, no, not even 
from the beginning.

44 And they were inspired by the 
a Zoramites and the Amalekites, who 
were their chief captains and lead-
ers, and by Zerahemnah, who was 
their  chief  captain,  or  their  chief 
leader and commander; yea, they did 
fight like dragons, and many of the 
Nephites were slain by their hands, 
yea, for they did smite in two many 
of their head-plates, and they did 
pierce many of their breastplates, 
and they did smite off many of their  
arms; and thus the Lamanites did 
smite in their fierce anger.

45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were 
inspired by a a better cause, for they 
were  not  b fighting  for  monarchy 
nor power but they were fighting 
for their homes and their c liberties, 

their wives and their children, and 
their all, yea, for their rites of wor-
ship and their church.

46 And they were doing that which 
they felt was the a duty which they 
owed to their God; for the Lord had 
said unto them, and also unto their 
fathers, that:  b Inasmuch as ye are 
not guilty of the c first offense, nei-
ther the second, ye shall not suffer 
yourselves to be slain by the hands 
of your enemies.

47 And  again,  the  Lord  has  said 
that: Ye shall a defend your families 
even  unto  b bloodshed.  Therefore 
for  this  cause  were  the  Nephites 
contending with the Lamanites, to 
defend themselves, and their fami-
lies, and their lands, their country, 
and their rights, and their religion.
48 And it came to pass that when 
the men of Moroni saw the fierce-
ness and the anger of the Lamanites, 
they were about to shrink and flee 
from them. And Moroni, perceiving 
their intent, sent forth and inspired 
their hearts with these thoughts—
yea,  the  thoughts  of  their  lands, 
their  liberty,  yea,  their  freedom 
from bondage.

49 And it came to pass that they 
turned  upon  the  Lamanites,  and 
they  a cried  with  one  voice  b unto 
the Lord their God, for their c liberty 
and their freedom from bondage.

50 And  they  a began  to  stand 
against the Lamanites with power; 
and in that selfsame hour that they 
cried unto the Lord for their free-
dom, the Lamanites began to flee 
before them; and they fled even to 
the waters of Sidon.

51 Now, the Lamanites were more 
a numerous,  yea,  by  more  than  
double  the  number  of  the  Neph-
ites; nevertheless, they were driven

insomuch that they were gathered 
together in one body in the valley, 
upon the bank by the river Sidon.
52 Therefore the armies of Moroni 
encircled  them  about,  yea,  even 
on both sides of the river, for be-
hold, on the east were the men of  
Lehi.

53 Therefore  when  Zerahemnah 
saw the men of Lehi on the east of 
the river Sidon, and the armies of 
Moroni on the west of the river Si-
don, that they were encircled about 
by the Nephites, they were struck 
with terror.

54 Now Moroni, when he saw their 
a terror,  commanded  his  men  that 
they  should  stop  shedding  their 
blood.

CHAPTER 44

Moroni  commands  the  Lamanites  to 
make  a  covenant  of  peace  or  be  de-
stroyed—Zerahemnah rejects the offer,  
and the battle resumes—Moroni’s armies  
defeat the Lamanites. About 74–73 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
stop  and  withdrew  a  pace  from 
them. And Moroni said unto a Zera-
hemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that 
we do b not desire to be men of blood. 
Ye know that ye are in our hands, 
yet we do not desire to slay you.

2 Behold,  we  have  not  come  out 
to battle against you that we might 
shed your blood for power; neither 
do  we  desire  to  bring  any  one  to 
the  a yoke  of  bondage.  But  this  is 
the b very cause for which ye have 
come against us; yea, and ye are an-
gry with us because of our religion.
3 But now, ye behold that the Lord 
is with us; and ye behold that he 
has delivered you into our hands. 
And  now  I  would  that  ye  should 
understand that this is done unto 
us  a because  of  our  religion  and 
our  faith  in  Christ.  And  now  ye 

see  that  ye  cannot  destroy  this  
our faith.

4 Now ye see that this is the true 
faith of God; yea, ye see that God 
will support, and keep, and preserve 
us, so long as we are a faithful unto 
him,  and  unto  our  faith,  and  our 
religion;  and  never  will  the  Lord 
suffer  that  we  shall  be  destroyed 
except  we  should  fall  into  trans-
gression and deny our faith.

5 And  now,  Zerahemnah,  I  com-
mand  you,  in  the  name  of  that 
all-powerful God, who has strength-
ened our arms that we have gained 
power  over  you,  a by  our  faith,  by 
our  religion,  and  by  our  b rites  of 
worship, and by our church, and by 
the sacred support which we owe 
to our c wives and our children, by 
that d liberty which binds us to our 
lands and our country; yea, and also 
by the maintenance of the sacred 
word of God, to which we owe all 
our  happiness;  and  by  all  that  is 
most dear unto us—

6 Yea,  and  this  is  not  all;  I  com-
mand you by all the desires which 
ye have for life, that ye a deliver up 
your weapons of war unto us, and 
we will seek not your blood, but we  
will b spare your lives, if ye will go 
your  way  and  come  not  again  to 
war against us.

7 And now, if ye do not this, be-
hold,  ye  are  in  our  hands,  and  I 
will  command  my  men  that  they 
shall fall upon you, and a inflict the 
wounds of death in your bodies, that 
ye may become extinct; and then 
we will see who shall have power 
over  this  people;  yea,  we  will  see 
who shall be brought into bondage.
8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Zerahemnah had heard these 
sayings he came forth and delivered 
up his a sword and his cimeter, and 
his bow into the hands of Moroni, 
and said unto him: Behold, here are

our weapons of war; we will deliver 
them up unto you, but we will not 
suffer  ourselves  to  take  an  b oath 
unto you, which we know that we 
shall break, and also our children; 
but take our weapons of war, and 
suffer that we may depart into the 
wilderness;  otherwise  we  will  re-
tain our swords, and we will perish 
or conquer.

9 Behold, we are a not of your faith; 
we do not believe that it is God that 
has delivered us into your hands; but 
we believe that it is your cunning 
that  has  preserved  you  from  our 
swords. Behold, it is your  b breast-
plates  and  your  shields  that  have 
preserved you.

10 And  now  when  Zerahemnah 
had made an end of speaking these 
words, Moroni returned the sword 
and the weapons of war, which he 
had  received,  unto  Zerahemnah, 
saying:  Behold,  we  will  end  the  
conflict.

11 Now I cannot recall the words 
which  I  have  spoken,  therefore 
as  the  Lord  liveth,  ye  shall  not 
depart  except  ye  depart  with  an 
oath that ye will not return again 
against us to war. Now as ye are in 
our hands we will spill your blood 
upon the ground, or ye shall sub-
mit to the conditions which I have  
proposed.

12 And now when Moroni had said 
these words, Zerahemnah retained 
his sword, and he was angry with 
Moroni,  and  he  rushed  forward 
that he might slay Moroni; but as 
he raised his sword, behold, one of 
Moroni’s soldiers smote it even to  
the earth, and it broke by the hilt; 
and he also smote Zerahemnah that 
he took off his scalp and it fell to 
the earth. And Zerahemnah with-
drew  from  before  them  into  the 
midst of his soldiers.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
soldier  who  stood  by,  who  smote 
off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took 
up the scalp from off the ground by 

the hair, and laid it upon the point 
of his sword, and stretched it forth 
unto them, saying unto them with 
a loud voice:

14 Even  as  this  scalp  has  fallen 
to the earth, which is the scalp of 
your  chief,  so  shall  ye  fall  to  the 
earth except ye will deliver up your 
weapons of war and depart with a 
covenant of peace.

15 Now  there  were  many,  when 
they  heard  these  words  and  saw 
the  scalp  which  was  upon  the 
sword, that were struck with fear; 
and  many  came  forth  and  threw 
down  their  weapons  of  war  at 
the  feet  of  Moroni,  and  entered 
into a a covenant of peace. And as 
many  as  entered  into  a  covenant 
they  suffered  to  b depart  into  the  
wilderness.

16 Now it came to pass that Zera-
hemnah  was  exceedingly  wroth, 
and he did stir up the remainder 
of  his  soldiers  to  anger,  to  con-
tend more powerfully against the  
Nephites.

17 And  now  Moroni  was  angry, 
because  of  the  stubbornness  of 
the  Lamanites;  therefore  he  com-
manded his people that they should 
fall upon them and slay them. And 
it came to pass that they began to 
slay them; yea, and the Lamanites 
did contend with their swords and 
their might.

18 But behold, their naked skins 
and their bare heads were exposed 
to the sharp swords of the Nephites; 
yea, behold they were pierced and 
smitten, yea, and did fall exceed-
ingly fast before the swords of the 
Nephites;  and  they  began  to  be 
swept down, even as the soldier of 
Moroni had prophesied.

19 Now  Zerahemnah,  when  he 
saw  that  they  were  all  about  to 
be destroyed, cried mightily unto 
Moroni,  promising  that  he  would 
covenant and also his people with 
them,  if  they would  spare the re-
mainder  of  their  lives,  that  they

a never  would  come  to  war  again  
against them.

20 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused that the work of death should 
a cease again among the people. And 
he took the weapons of war from 
the Lamanites; and after they had 
entered into a b covenant with him 
of peace they were suffered to de-
part into the wilderness.

21 Now the number of their dead 
was not numbered because of the 
greatness of the number; yea, the 
number of their dead was exceed-
ingly great, both on the Nephites 
and on the Lamanites.

22 And it came to pass that they 
did cast their dead into the waters 
of Sidon, and they have gone forth 
and  are  buried  in  the  depths  of  
the a sea.

23 And the armies of the Nephites, 
or of Moroni, returned and came to 
their houses and their lands.

24 And thus ended the eighteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi. And thus ended 
the record of Alma, which was writ-
ten upon the plates of Nephi.

The account of the people of Nephi, 
and their wars and dissensions, in 
the days of Helaman, according to 
the  record  of  Helaman,  which  he 
kept in his days.

Comprising chapters 45 through 62.

CHAPTER 45

Helaman believes the words of Alma—
Alma prophesies the destruction of the 
Nephites—He  blesses  and  curses  the 
land—Alma may have been taken up 
by the Spirit, even as Moses—Dissen-
sion grows in the Church. About 73 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that the 

people of Nephi were exceedingly 
rejoiced, because the Lord had again 
a delivered them out of the hands of 
their enemies; therefore they gave 
thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, 
and they did b fast much and pray 
much,  and  they  did  worship  God 
with exceedingly great joy.

2 And it came to pass in the nine-
teenth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, that Alma 
came  unto  his  son  Helaman  and 
said unto him: Believest thou the 
words which I spake unto thee con-
cerning those a records which have  
been kept?

3 And  Helaman  said  unto  him: 

Yea, I a believe.

4 And Alma said again: Believest 
thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?
5 And  he  said:  Yea,  I  believe  all 
the words which thou hast spoken.
6 And Alma said unto him again: 
Will ye a keep my commandments?
7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy 
commandments with all my heart.
8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed 
art thou; and the Lord shall a pros-
per thee in this land.

9 But  behold,  I  have  somewhat 
to  a prophesy  unto  thee;  but  what 
I prophesy unto thee ye shall not 
make known; yea, what I prophesy 
unto thee shall not be made known, 
even until the prophecy is fulfilled; 
therefore write the words which I 
shall say.

10 And  these  are  the  words:  Be-
hold, I perceive that this very peo-
ple, the Nephites, according to the 
spirit of revelation which is in me, 
in  a four  hundred  years  from  the 
time that Jesus Christ shall manifest 
himself unto them, shall dwindle in  
b unbelief.

11 Yea,  and  then  shall  they  see 
wars  and  pestilences,  yea,  fam-
ines and bloodshed, even until the

people  of  Nephi  shall  become  
a extinct—

12 Yea,  and  this  because  they 
shall dwindle in unbelief and fall 
into  the  works  of  darkness,  and 
a lasciviousness, and all manner of 
iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that 
because  they  shall  sin  against  so 
great light and knowledge, yea, I say 
unto you, that from that day, even 
the b fourth generation shall not all 
pass away before this great iniquity  
shall come.

13 And  when  that  great  day 
cometh, behold, the time very soon 
cometh that those who are now, or 
the seed of those who are now num-
bered among the people of Nephi, 
shall a no more be numbered among 
the people of Nephi.

14 But whosoever remaineth, and 
is not destroyed in that great and 
dreadful day, shall be  a numbered 
among  the  b Lamanites,  and  shall 
become  like  unto  them,  all,  save 
it be a few who shall be called the 
disciples  of  the  Lord;  and  them 
shall  the  Lamanites  pursue  even 
c until  they  shall  become  extinct. 
And now, because of iniquity, this 
prophecy shall be fulfilled.

15 And now it came to pass that 
after Alma had said these things to 
Helaman, he a blessed him, and also 
his other sons; and he also blessed 
the earth for the b righteous’ sake.

16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord 
God—a Cursed  shall  be  the  land, 
yea,  this  land,  unto  every  nation, 
kindred, tongue, and people, unto 
destruction,  which  do  b wickedly, 
when they are fully ripe; and as I 
have said so shall it be; for this is 
the cursing and the c blessing of God 
upon the land, for the Lord cannot 

look upon sin with the d least degree 
of allowance.

17 And now, when Alma had said 
these words he blessed the a church, 
yea, all those who should stand fast 
in the faith from that time hence-
forth.

18 And when Alma had done this 
he a departed out of the land of  Zara-
hemla, as if to go into the land of 
b Melek.  And  it  came  to  pass  that 
he was never heard of more; as to 
his death or burial we know not of.
19 Behold, this we know, that he 
was a righteous man; and the say-
ing went abroad in the church that 
he was taken up by the a Spirit, or 
b buried  by  the  hand  of  the  Lord, 
even as Moses. But behold, the scrip-
tures saith the Lord took Moses unto  
himself;  and  we  suppose  that  he 
has also received Alma in the spirit, 
unto  himself;  therefore,  for  this 
cause we know nothing concerning 
his death and burial.

20 And now it came to pass in the 
commencement of the nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, that Helaman 
went forth among the people to de-
clare the a word unto them.

21 For  behold,  because  of  their 
wars  with  the  Lamanites  and  the 
many little dissensions and distur-
bances which had been among the 
people, it became expedient that the 
a word  of  God  should  be  declared 
among them, yea, and that a b regu-
lation should be made throughout 
the church.

22 Therefore,  a Helaman  and  his 
brethren went forth to establish the 
church again in all the land, yea, in 
every city throughout all the land 
which was possessed by the people

of Nephi. And it came to pass that 
they did appoint b priests and c teach-
ers throughout all the land, over all 
the churches.

23 And now it came to pass that 
after  Helaman  and  his  brethren 
had appointed priests and teachers 
over the churches that there arose a 
a dissension among them, and they 
would not give heed to the words 
of Helaman and his brethren;

24 But  they  grew  proud,  being 
lifted  up  in  their  hearts,  because 
of their exceedingly great a riches; 
therefore  they  grew  rich  in  their 
own eyes, and would not give heed 
to their words, to b walk uprightly 
before God.

CHAPTER 46
Amalickiah conspires to be king—Mo-
roni raises the title of liberty—He rallies 
the  people  to  defend  their  religion—
True believers are called Christians—A 
remnant of Joseph will be preserved—
Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to 
the land of Nephi—Those who will not 
support the cause of freedom are put to 
death. About 73–72 b.c.

And it came to pass that as many 
as would not hearken to the a words 
of Helaman and his brethren were 
gathered  together  against  their 
brethren.

2 And now behold, they were ex-
ceedingly  wroth,  insomuch  that 
they were determined to slay them.
3 Now  the  leader  of  those  who 
were wroth against their brethren 
was a large and a strong man; and 
his name was a Amalickiah.

4 And Amalickiah was desirous to 
be a  a king; and those people who 
were wroth were also desirous that 

he should be their king; and they 
were the greater part of them the 
lower b judges of the land, and they 
were seeking for power.

5 And  they  had  been  led  by  the 
a flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they 
would  support  him  and  establish 
him to be their king that he would 
make them rulers over the people.
6 Thus  they  were  led  away  by 
Amalickiah to dissensions, notwith-
standing the preaching of Helaman 
and  his  brethren,  yea,  notwith-
standing  their  exceedingly  great 
care over the church, for they were 
a high priests over the church.

7 And  there  were  many  in  the 
church who believed in the  a flat-
tering words of Amalickiah, there-
fore they b dissented even from the 
church; and thus were the affairs 
of  the  people  of  Nephi  exceed-
ingly  precarious  and  dangerous, 
notwithstanding  their  great  c vic-
tory which they had had over the 
Lamanites, and their great rejoic-
ings which they had had because 
of their d deliverance by the hand of  
the Lord.

8 Thus we see how a quick the chil-
dren of men do b forget the Lord their 
God, yea, how quick to do c iniquity, 
and to be led away by the evil one.
9 Yea,  and  we  also  see  the  great 
a wickedness one very wicked man 
can cause to take place among the 
children of men.

10 Yea,  we  see  that  Amalickiah, 
because he was a man of cunning 
device and a man of many flattering 
words, that he led away the hearts 
of many people to do wickedly; yea, 
and to seek to a destroy the church of 
God, and to destroy the foundation

unto them, or which blessing God 
had sent upon the face of the land 
for the c righteous’ sake.

11 And now it came to pass that 
when Moroni, who was the  a chief 
commander  of  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites,  had  heard  of  these  dis-
sensions, he was angry with Amal-
ickiah.

12 And it came to pass that he rent 
his coat; and he took a piece thereof, 
and wrote upon it—a In memory of 
our God, our religion, and freedom, 
and our peace, our wives, and our 
children—and he fastened it upon 
the end of a pole.

13 And he fastened on his head-
plate, and his a breastplate, and his 
shields,  and  girded  on  his  armor 
about his loins; and he took the pole, 
which had on the end thereof his 
rent coat, (and he called it the b title 
of liberty) and he c bowed himself 
to the earth, and he prayed might-
ily unto his God for the blessings 
of  liberty  to  rest  upon  his  breth-
ren, so long as there should a band 
of  d Christians  remain  to  possess  
the land—

14 For thus were all the true be-
lievers  of  Christ,  who  belonged 
to  the  church  of  God,  called  by 
those  who  did  not  belong  to  the  
church.

15 And  those  who  did  belong  to 
the church were a faithful; yea, all 
those  who  were  true  believers  in 
Christ b took upon them, gladly, the 
name  of  Christ,  or  c Christians  as 
they were called, because of their 
belief in Christ who should come.
16 And  therefore,  at  this  time,  
Moroni prayed that the cause of the 

Christians, and the a freedom of the 
land might be favored.

17 And it came to pass that when 
he had poured out his soul to God, 
he named all the land which was 
a south of the land b Desolation, yea, 
and in fine, all the land, both on the 
c north and on the south—A chosen 
land, and the land of d liberty.

18 And he said: Surely God shall 
not a suffer that we, who are despised 
because we take upon us the name 
of Christ, shall be trodden down and 
destroyed, until we bring it upon us 
by our own b transgressions.

19 And  when  Moroni  had  said 
these words, he went forth among 
the people, waving the a rent part of 
his garment in the air, that all might 
see the writing which he had writ-
ten upon the rent part, and crying 
with a loud voice, saying:

20 Behold, whosoever will main-
tain  this  title  upon  the  land,  let 
them  come  forth  in  the  strength 
of the Lord, and a enter into a cov-
enant that they will b maintain their 
rights, and their religion, that the 
Lord God may bless them.

21 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni had proclaimed these words, 
behold,  the people  came  running 
a together with their armor girded 
about their loins, b rending their gar-
ments in token, or as a  c covenant, 
that  they  would  not  forsake  the 
Lord their God; or, in other words, 
if they should transgress the com-
mandments  of  God,  or  fall  into 
transgression, and be d ashamed to 
take upon them the name of Christ, 
the Lord should rend them even as 
they had rent their garments.

22 Now  this  was  the  covenant 
which  they  made,  and  they  a cast 
their garments at the feet of Moroni, 
saying: We b covenant with our God, 
that we shall be destroyed, even as 
our brethren in the land northward, 
if we shall fall into transgression; 
yea, he may cast us at the feet of 
our enemies, even as we have cast 
our garments at thy feet to be trod-
den under foot, if we shall fall into 
transgression.

23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, 
we are a a remnant of the seed of Ja-
cob; yea, we are a remnant of the 
seed of b Joseph, whose c coat was rent 
by his brethren into many pieces; 
yea, and now behold, let us remem-
ber to keep the commandments of 
God, or our garments shall be rent 
by  our  brethren,  and  we  be  cast 
into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty 
as a a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us 
remember the words of Jacob, be-
fore his death, for behold, he saw 
that a b part of the c remnant of the 
coat of Joseph was d preserved and 
had not decayed. And he said—Even 
as this remnant of garment of my 
son hath been preserved, so shall a 
e remnant of the seed of my son be 
preserved by the hand of God, and 
be taken unto himself, while the re-
mainder of the seed of Joseph shall 
perish, even as the remnant of his  
garment.

25 Now behold, this giveth my soul 
sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath 
joy in my son, because of that part 
of  his  seed  which  shall  be  taken 
unto God.

26 Now behold, this was the lan-

guage of Jacob.

27 And now who knoweth but what 
the remnant of the seed of Joseph, 
which shall perish as his garment, 
are those who have dissented from 

us? Yea, and even it shall be our-
selves if we do not stand fast in the 
faith of Christ.

28 And now it came to pass that 
when Moroni had said these words 
he went forth, and also sent forth 
in all the parts of the land where 
there were dissensions, and gathered 
together  all  the  people  who  were 
desirous to maintain their liberty, 
to  stand  against  Amalickiah  and 
those who had dissented, who were 
called Amalickiahites.

29 And it came to pass that when 
Amalickiah saw that the people of 
Moroni were more numerous than 
the  Amalickiahites—and  he  also 
saw that his people were a doubtful 
concerning the justice of the cause 
in  which  they  had  undertaken—
therefore,  fearing  that  he  should 
not gain the point, he took those of 
his people who would and departed 
into the b land of Nephi.

30 Now Moroni thought it was not 
expedient that the Lamanites should 
have any more a strength; therefore 
he thought to cut off the people of 
Amalickiah,  or  to  take  them  and 
bring them back, and put Amalick-
iah to death; yea, for he knew that 
he would stir up the Lamanites to 
anger against them, and cause them 
to  come  to  battle  against  them; 
and this he knew that Amalickiah 
would do that he might obtain his  
purposes.

31 Therefore  Moroni  thought  it  
was  expedient  that  he  should  
take his armies, who had gathered 
themselves  together,  and  armed 
themselves, and entered into a cov-
enant  to  keep  the  peace—and  it 
came to pass that he took his army 
and marched out with his tents into 
the wilderness, to cut off the course 
of Amalickiah in the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that he did

according to his desires, and marched  
forth  into  the  wilderness,  and 
headed the armies of Amalickiah.
33 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah a fled with a small number of 
his men, and the remainder were 
delivered up into the hands of Mo-
roni and were taken back into the 
land of Zarahemla.

34 Now, Moroni being a man who 
was a appointed by the chief judges 
and the voice of the people, there-
fore he had power according to his 
will with the armies of the Neph-
ites,  to  establish  and  to  exercise 
authority over them.

35 And it came to pass that whom-
soever  of  the  Amalickiahites  that 
would not enter into a covenant to 
support the a cause of freedom, that 
they might maintain a free b govern-
ment, he caused to be put to death; 
and there were but few who denied 
the covenant of freedom.

36 And it came to pass also, that 
he caused the a title of liberty to be 
hoisted upon every tower which was 
in all the land, which was possessed 
by the Nephites; and thus Moroni 
planted  the  standard  of  liberty 
among the Nephites.

37 And they began to have peace 
again in the land; and thus they did 
maintain  peace  in  the  land  until 
nearly  the  end  of  the  nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges.

38 And  Helaman  and  the  a high 
priests did also maintain order in 
the church; yea, even for the space 
of four years did they have much 
peace and rejoicing in the church.
39 And it came to pass that there 
were many who died, firmly a believ-
ing that their souls were redeemed 
by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they 
went out of the world rejoicing.

40 And there were some who died 

with fevers, which at some seasons 
of the year were very frequent in 
the land—but not so much so with 
fevers,  because  of  the  excellent 
quali ties of the many  a plants and 
roots which God had prepared to re-
move the cause of  b diseases, to which 
men were subject by the nature of  
the climate—

41 But there were many who died 
with a old age; and those who died 
in the faith of Christ are b happy in  
him, as we must needs suppose.

CHAPTER 47
Amalickiah  uses  treachery,  murder, 
and intrigue to become king of the La-
manites—The  Nephite  dissenters  are 
more  wicked  and  ferocious  than  the 
Lamanites. About 72 b.c.
Now we will return in our record 
to Amalickiah and those who had 
a fled with him into the wilderness; 
for, behold, he had taken those who 
went with him, and went up in the 
b land of Nephi among the Laman-
ites, and did c stir up the Lamanites  
to  anger  against  the  people  of 
Nephi, insomuch that the king of 
the Lamanites sent a proclamation 
throughout all his land, among all 
his people, that they should gather 
themselves together again to go to 
battle against the Nephites.

2 And it came to pass that when 
the  proclamation  had  gone  forth 
among them they were exceedingly 
afraid; yea, they a feared to displease 
the king, and they also feared to go 
to battle against the Nephites lest 
they should lose their lives. And it 
came to pass that they would not, 
or  the  more  part  of  them  would 
not,  obey  the  commandments  of  
the king.

3 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that

the  king  was  wroth  because  of 
their  disobedience;  therefore  he 
gave Amalickiah the command of 
that  part  of  his  army  which  was 
obedient unto his commands, and 
commanded him that he should go 
forth and a compel them to arms.

4 Now behold, this was the desire 
of Amalickiah; for he being a very 
a subtle man to do evil therefore he 
laid  the  plan  in  his  heart  to  b de-
throne the king of the Lamanites.
5 And  now  he  had  got  the  com-
mand of those parts of the Laman-
ites who were in favor of the king; 
and he sought to gain favor of those 
who were not obedient; therefore 
he went forward to the place which 
was called a Onidah, for thither had 
all  the  Lamanites  fled;  for  they 
discovered the army coming, and, 
supposing that they were coming to 
destroy them, therefore they fled to 
Onidah, to the place of arms.

6 And they had appointed a man 
to be a king and a leader over them,  
being  fixed  in  their  minds  with  
a determined resolution that they 
would  a not  be  subjected  to  go 
against the Nephites.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
had gathered themselves together 
upon the top of the mount which 
was called Antipas, in preparation 
to battle.

8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s in-
tention to give them battle accord-
ing  to  the  commandments  of  the 
king; but behold, it was his inten-
tion to gain favor with the armies of 
the Lamanites, that he might place 
himself at their head and dethrone 
the king and take possession of the 
kingdom.

9 And behold, it came to pass that 
he caused his army to pitch their 
tents in the valley which was near 
the mount Antipas.

10 And it came to pass that when it 
was night he sent a secret embassy 
into  the  mount  Antipas,  desiring 

that the leader of those who were 
upon the mount, whose name was 
Lehonti, that he should come down 
to the foot of the mount, for he de-
sired to speak with him.

11 And it came to pass that when 
Lehonti  received  the  message  he 
durst  not  go  down  to  the  foot  of 
the mount. And it came to pass that 
Amalickiah sent again the second 
time, desiring him to come down. 
And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lehonti 
would  not;  and  he  sent  again  the 
third time.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Amalickiah  found  that  he  could 
not get Lehonti to come down off 
from the mount, he went up into 
the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp; 
and he sent again the fourth time 
his message unto Lehonti, desiring 
that he would come down, and that 
he would bring his guards with him.
13 And it came to pass that when 
Lehonti  had  come  down  with  his 
guards to Amalickiah, that Amal-
ickiah desired him to come down 
with his army in the night-time, and  
surround those men in their camps 
over whom the king had given him 
command, and that he would deliver 
them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he 
would  make  him  (Amalickiah)  a 
second a leader over the whole army.
14 And it came to pass that Lehonti 
came down with his men and sur-
rounded the men of Amalickiah, so 
that before they awoke at the dawn 
of day they were surrounded by the 
armies of Lehonti.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they saw that they were surrounded, 
they pled with Amalickiah that he 
would suffer them to fall in with 
their brethren, that they might not 
be destroyed. Now this was the very 
thing which Amalickiah desired.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
delivered  his  men,  a contrary  to 
the  commands  of  the  king.  Now 
this was the thing that Amalickiah

desired, that he might accomplish 
his designs in dethroning the king.
17 Now it was the custom among 
the Lamanites, if their chief leader 
was  killed,  to  appoint  the  second 
leader to be their chief leader.

18 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah caused that one of his ser-
vants should administer a poison by 
degrees to Lehonti, that he died.

19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, 
the Lamanites appointed Amalick-
iah to be their leader and their chief 
commander.

20 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah marched with his armies (for 
he  had  gained  his  desires)  to  the 
a land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, 
which was the chief city.

21 And the king came out to meet 
him with his guards, for he supposed 
that Amalickiah had a fulfilled his 
commands,  and  that  Amalickiah 
had gathered together so great an 
army  to  go  against  the  Nephites  
to battle.

22 But behold, as the king came 
out to meet him Amalickiah caused 
that his servants should go forth to 
meet the king. And they went and 
a bowed themselves before the king, 
as if to reverence him because of 
his greatness.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king  put  forth  his  hand  to  raise 
them, as was the custom with the La-
manites, as a token of peace, which 
custom  they  had  taken  from  the  
Nephites.

24 And it came to pass that when 
he  had  raised  the  first  from  the 
ground, behold he stabbed the king 
to the heart; and he fell to the earth.
25 Now  the  servants  of  the  king 
fled; and the servants of Amalick-
iah raised a cry, saying:

26 Behold, the servants of the king 
have stabbed him to the heart, and 
he  has  fallen  and  they  have  fled; 
behold, come and see.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  

Amalickiah  commanded  that  his 
armies should march forth and see 
what had happened to the king; and 
when they had come to the spot, and  
found  the  king  lying  in  his  gore, 
Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, 
and said: Whosoever loved the king, 
let him go forth, and pursue his ser-
vants that they may be slain.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  all 
they  who  loved  the  king,  when 
they heard these words, came forth 
and pursued after the servants of  
the king.

29 Now when the a servants of the 
king  saw  an  army  pursuing  after 
them, they were frightened again, 
and fled into the wilderness, and 
came  over  into  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla  and  joined  the  b people  of  
Ammon.

30 And the army which pursued 
after  them  returned,  having  pur-
sued after them in vain; and thus 
Amalickiah, by his  a fraud, gained 
the hearts of the people.

31 And it came to pass on the mor-
row he entered the city Nephi with 
his armies, and took possession of 
the city.

32 And now it came to pass that the  
queen,  when  she  had  heard  that 
the king was slain—for Amalickiah 
had sent an embassy to the queen 
informing  her  that  the  king  had 
been slain by his servants, that he 
had pursued them with his army, 
but  it  was  in  vain,  and  they  had 
made their escape—

33 Therefore, when the queen had 
received this message she sent unto 
Amalickiah,  desiring  him  that  he 
would spare the people of the city; 
and  she  also  desired  him  that  he 
should come in unto her; and she 
also  desired  him  that  he  should 
bring a witnesses with him to testify 
concerning the death of the king.
34 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah took the same servant that 
slew  the  king,  and  all  them  who

were with him, and went in unto 
the  queen,  unto  the  place  where 
she sat; and they all a testified unto 
her that the king was slain by his 
own  servants;  and  they  said  also: 
They have fled; does not this tes-
tify  against  them?  And  thus  they 
satisfied the queen concerning the 
death of the king.

35 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah  sought  the  a favor  of  the 
queen,  and  took  her  unto  him  to 
wife; and thus by his b fraud, and by  
the assistance of his cunning ser-
vants, he c obtained the kingdom; yea, 
he was acknowledged king through-
out  all  the  land,  among  all  the  
people of the Lamanites, who were 
d composed  of  the  Lamanites  and 
the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, 
and all the dissenters of the Neph-
ites, from the reign of Nephi down  
to the present time.

36 Now these  a dissenters, having 
the same instruction and the same 
information  of  the  Nephites,  yea, 
having been instructed in the same 
b knowledge of the Lord, neverthe-
less, it is strange to relate, not long 
after their dissensions they became 
more hardened and c impenitent, and 
more  wild,  wicked  and  ferocious 
than  the  Lamanites—drinking  in  
with the d traditions of the Laman-
ites; giving way to e indolence, and 
all manner of lasciviousness; yea, en-
tirely forgetting the Lord their God.

CHAPTER 48
Amalickiah  incites  the  Lamanites 
against the Nephites—Moroni prepares 
his  people  to  defend  the  cause  of  the 
Christians—He rejoices in liberty and 
freedom and is a mighty man of God. 
About 72 b.c.

And  now  it  came  to  pass  that,  as 
soon as a Amalickiah had obtained  
the kingdom he began to b inspire the  
hearts  of  the  Lamanites  against 
the  people  of  Nephi;  yea,  he  did 
appoint men to speak unto the La-
manites from their c towers, against 
the Nephites.

2 And  thus  he  did  inspire  their 
hearts  against  the  Nephites,  inso-
much that in the latter end of the 
a nineteenth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the judges, he having accomplished 
his designs thus far, yea, having been 
made king over the Lamanites, he 
b sought also to  c reign over all the  
land, yea, and all the people who 
were in the land, the Nephites as 
well as the Lamanites.

3 Therefore he had accomplished 
his design, for he had hardened the 
hearts of the Lamanites and blinded 
their minds, and stirred them up to 
anger, insomuch that he had gath-
ered together a numerous host to 
go to battle against the Nephites.

4 For he was determined, because 
of the greatness of the number of his 
people, to a overpower the Nephites 
and to bring them into bondage.

5 And thus he did appoint a chief 
captains of the b Zoramites, they be-
ing the most acquainted with the 
strength of the Nephites, and their 
places  of  resort,  and  the  weakest 
parts  of  their  cities;  therefore  he 
appointed them to be chief captains 
over his armies.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
took their camp, and moved forth 
toward  the  land  of  Zarahemla  in 
the wilderness.

7 Now it came to pass that while 
Amalickiah had thus been obtaining 
power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on 
the other hand, had been a preparing

the minds of the people to be faith-
ful unto the Lord their God.

8 Yea, he had been strengthening 
the  armies  of  the  Nephites,  and 
erecting  small  a forts,  or  places  of 
resort; throwing up banks of earth 
round about to enclose his armies, 
and also building b walls of stone to 
encircle them about, round about 
their cities and the borders of their 
lands; yea, all round about the land.
9 And in their weakest fortifica-
tions he did place the greater num-
ber of men; and thus he did fortify 
and strengthen the land which was 
possessed by the Nephites.

10 And thus he was preparing to 
a support their liberty, their lands, 
their wives, and their children, and 
their peace, and that they might live 
unto the Lord their God, and that 
they might maintain that which was 
called by their enemies the cause 
of b Christians.

11 And Moroni was a a strong and 
a mighty man; he was a man of a 
perfect b understanding; yea, a man 
that did not delight in bloodshed; a 
man whose soul did joy in the lib-
erty and the freedom of his coun-
try, and his brethren from bondage 
and slavery;

12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell 
with thanksgiving to his God, for the  
many privileges and blessings which 
he bestowed upon his people; a man 
who did labor exceedingly for the 
a welfare and safety of his people.

13 Yea,  and  he  was  a  man  who 
was firm in the faith of Christ, and 
he had a sworn with an oath to de-
fend his people, his rights, and his 
country, and his religion, even to 
the loss of his blood.

14 Now the Nephites were taught 

to defend themselves against their 
enemies,  even  to  the  shedding  of 
blood if it were necessary; yea, and 
they were also taught a never to give 
an offense, yea, and never to raise 
the sword except it were against an 
enemy, except it were to preserve 
their lives.

15 And this was their a faith, that by 
so doing God would b prosper them 
in the land, or in other words, if they 
were faithful in keeping the com-
mandments of God that he would 
prosper them in the land; yea, warn 
them to flee, or to prepare for war, 
according to their danger;

16 And also, that God would make 
it known unto them a whither they 
should  go  to  defend  themselves 
against  their  enemies,  and  by  so 
doing, the Lord would deliver them; 
and  this  was  the  faith  of  Moroni, 
and his heart did glory in it;  b not 
in the shedding of blood but in do-
ing good, in preserving his people, 
yea, in keeping the commandments 
of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.
17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, 
if all men had been, and were, and 
ever would be, like unto  a Moroni, 
behold,  the  very  powers  of  hell 
would  have  been  shaken  forever; 
yea,  the  b devil  would  never  have 
power over the hearts of the children  
of men.

18 Behold, he was a man like unto 
a Ammon,  the  son  of  Mosiah,  yea, 
and even the other sons of Mosiah, 
yea, and also Alma and his sons, for 
they were all men of God.

19 Now behold, Helaman and his 
brethren were no less a serviceable 
unto the people than was Moroni; 
for  they  did  preach  the  word  of 
God,  and  they  did  baptize  unto

repentance  all  men  whosoever 
would hearken unto their words.

20 And thus they went forth, and 
the people did a humble themselves 
because of their b words, insomuch 
that  they  were  highly  c favored  of 
the Lord, and thus they were free 
from wars and contentions among 
themselves, yea, even for the space 
of four years.

21 But, as I have said, in the a latter 
end of the nineteenth year, yea, not-
withstanding their peace amongst 
themselves,  they  were  compelled 
reluctantly  to  contend  with  their 
brethren, the Lamanites.

22 Yea,  and  in  fine,  their  wars 
never  did  cease  for  the  space  of 
many  years  with  the  Lamanites, 
notwithstanding  their  much  re-
luctance.

23 Now, they were  a sorry to take 
up arms against the Lamanites, be-
cause  they  did  not  delight  in  the 
shedding  of  blood;  yea,  and  this 
was  not  all—they  were  b sorry  to 
be the means of sending so many 
of their brethren out of this world 
into an eternal world, c unprepared 
to meet their God.

24 Nevertheless,  they  could  not 
suffer to lay down their lives, that 
their  a wives  and  their  children 
should be  b massacred by the bar-
barous c cruelty of those who were 
once their brethren, yea, and had 
d dissented from their church, and 
had left them and had gone to de-
stroy them by joining the Lamanites.
25 Yea,  they  could  not  bear  that 
their brethren should rejoice over 
the blood of the Nephites, so long 
as there were any who should keep 
the commandments of God, for the 
promise  of  the  Lord  was,  if  they 
should  keep  his  commandments 
they should a prosper in the land.

CHAPTER 49

The  invading  Lamanites  are  unable 
to take the fortified cities of Ammoni-
hah  and  Noah—Amalickiah  curses 
God and swears to drink the blood of  
Moroni—Helaman  and  his  brethren 
continue  to  strengthen  the  Church. 
About 72 b.c.
And now it came to pass in the elev-
enth month of the nineteenth year, 
on the tenth day of the month, the 
armies of the Lamanites were seen 
approaching  towards  the  land  of 
a Ammonihah.

2 And behold, the city had been 
rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed 
an army by the borders of the city, 
and  they  had  a cast  up  dirt  round 
about to shield them from the ar-
rows and the b stones of the Laman-
ites;  for  behold,  they  fought  with 
stones and with arrows.

3 Behold,  I  said  that  the  city  of 
a Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say 
unto  you,  yea,  that  it  was  in  part 
rebuilt;  and  because  the  Laman-
ites had destroyed it once because 
of the iniquity of the people, they 
supposed  that  it  would  again  be-
come an easy prey for them.

4 But behold, how great was their 
disappointment;  for  behold,  the 
Nephites  had  dug  up  a  a ridge  of 
earth round about them, which was 
so  high  that  the  Lamanites  could 
not cast their stones and their ar-
rows at them that they might take 
effect, neither could they come upon 
them save it was by their place of 
b entrance.

5 Now at this time the chief a cap-
tains of the Lamanites were aston-
ished exceedingly, because of the 
wisdom of the Nephites in prepar-
ing their places of security.

had supposed, because of the great-
ness  of  their  numbers,  yea,  they 
supposed that they should be privi-
leged to come upon them as they 
had hitherto done; yea, and they had  
also  prepared  themselves  with 
shields,  and  with  a breastplates; 
and they had also prepared them-
selves with garments of skins, yea, 
very thick garments to cover their  
nakedness.

7 And  being  thus  prepared  they 
supposed  that  they  should  easily 
overpower and a subject their breth-
ren to the yoke of bondage, or slay 
and  massacre  them  according  to 
their pleasure.

8 But  behold,  to  their  uttermost 
astonishment, they were a prepared 
for them, in a manner which never 
had  been  known  among  the  chil-
dren of Lehi. Now they were pre-
pared for the Lamanites, to battle 
after the manner of the instructions  
of Moroni.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, 
were  exceedingly  astonished  at 
their  manner  of  preparation  for  
war.

10 Now,  if  king  Amalickiah  had 
come down out of the a land of Nephi, 
at  the  head  of  his  army,  perhaps 
he would have caused the Laman-
ites to have attacked the Nephites 
at the city of Ammonihah; for be-
hold, he did care not for the blood 
of his people.

11 But behold, Amalickiah did not 
come down himself to battle. And 
behold,  his  chief  captains  durst 
not attack the Nephites at the city 
of  Ammonihah,  for  Moroni  had 
altered the management of affairs 
among the Nephites, insomuch that 
the  Lamanites  were  disappointed 
in their places of retreat and they 
could not come upon them.

12 Therefore  they  retreated  into 
the wilderness, and took their camp 

and marched towards the land of 
a Noah,  supposing  that  to  be  the 
next best place for them to come 
against the Nephites.

13 For they knew not that Moroni 
had  fortified,  or  had  built  a forts  
of security, for every city in all the 
land round about; therefore, they 
marched  forward  to  the  land  of 
Noah  with  a  firm  determination; 
yea, their chief captains came for-
ward and took an  b oath that they 
would  destroy  the  people  of  that 
city.

14 But behold, to their astonish-
ment, the city of Noah, which had 
hitherto  been  a  weak  place,  had 
now, by the means of Moroni, be-
come strong, yea, even to exceed the 
strength of the city Ammonihah.

15 And now, behold, this was wis-
dom in Moroni; for he had supposed 
that  they  would  be  frightened  at 
the  city  Ammonihah;  and  as  the 
city of Noah had hitherto been the 
weakest part of the land, therefore 
they  would  march  thither  to  bat-
tle;  and  thus  it  was  according  to  
his desires.

16 And  behold,  Moroni  had  ap-
pointed  Lehi  to  be  chief  captain 
over the men of that city; and it was 
that  a same  Lehi  who  fought  with 
the Lamanites in the valley on the 
east of the river Sidon.

17 And  now  behold  it  came  to 
pass, that when the Lamanites had 
found  that  Lehi  commanded  the 
city they were again disappointed, 
for  they  feared  Lehi  exceedingly; 
nevertheless  their  chief  captains 
had a sworn with an oath to attack 
the city; therefore, they brought up 
their armies.

18 Now  behold,  the  Lamanites 
could  not  get  into  their  forts  of 
security by any other way save by 
the entrance, because of the high-
ness of the bank which had been 
thrown  up,  and  the  depth  of  the

ditch  which  had  been  dug  round 
about, save it were by the entrance.
19 And thus were the Nephites pre-
pared to destroy all such as should 
attempt to climb up to enter the fort 
by any other way, by casting over 
stones and arrows at them.

20 Thus they were prepared, yea, 
a body of their strongest men, with 
their  swords  and  their  slings,  to 
smite down all who should attempt 
to  come  into  their  place  of  secu-
rity by the place of a entrance; and 
thus were they prepared to defend 
themselves against the Lamanites.
21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
captains of the Lamanites brought 
up  their  armies  before  the  place 
of entrance, and began to contend 
with the Nephites, to get into their 
place of security; but behold, they 
were driven back from time to time, 
insomuch that they were slain with 
an immense slaughter.

22 Now  when  they  found  that  
they could not obtain power over 
the Nephites by the pass, they be-
gan  to  dig  down  their  banks  of 
earth that they might obtain a pass 
to  their  armies,  that  they  might 
have an equal chance to fight; but 
behold, in these attempts they were 
swept off by the stones and arrows 
which  were  thrown  at  them;  and 
instead of filling up their ditches 
by pulling down the banks of earth, 
they  were  filled  up  in  a  measure 
with  their  dead  and  wounded  
bodies.

23 Thus the Nephites had all power 
over their enemies; and thus the La-
manites did attempt to destroy the 
Nephites until their a chief captains 
were all slain; yea, and more than 
a thousand of the Lamanites were 
slain;  while,  on  the  other  hand, 
there was not a single soul of the 
Nephites which was slain.

24 There  were  about  fifty  who 
were wounded, who had been ex-

posed to the arrows of the Lamanites  
through  the  pass,  but  they  were 
shielded by their a shields, and their 
breastplates, and their head-plates, 
insomuch that their wounds were 
upon their legs, many of which were  
very severe.

25 And it came to pass, that when 
the Lamanites saw that their chief 
captains  were  all  slain  they  fled 
into the wilderness. And it came to 
pass that they returned to the land  
of  Nephi,  to  inform  their  king, 
Amalickiah, who was a a Nephite by 
birth, concerning their great b loss.
26 And it came to pass that he was 
exceedingly angry with his people, 
because  he  had  not  obtained  his 
desire  over  the  Nephites;  he  had 
not subjected them to the yoke of 
bondage.

27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, 
and he did a curse God, and also Mo-
roni,  swearing  with  an  b oath  that 
he would drink his blood; and this 
because Moroni had kept the com-
mandments  of  God  in  preparing 
for the safety of his people.

28 And it came to pass, that on the 
other hand, the people of Nephi did 
a thank the Lord their God, because 
of his matchless power in deliver-
ing them from the hands of their 
enemies.

29 And thus ended the nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

30 Yea,  and  there  was  continual 
peace among them, and exceedingly 
great prosperity in the church be-
cause of their heed and diligence 
which they gave unto the word of 
God, which was declared unto them 
by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Cori-
anton, and Ammon and his breth-
ren, yea, and by all those who had 
been ordained by the  a holy order 
of  God,  being  baptized  unto  re-
pentance, and sent forth to preach 
among the people.

CHAPTER 50

Moroni fortifies the lands of the Neph-
ites—They build many new cities—Wars 
and destructions befell the Nephites in 
the days of their wickedness and abomi-
nations—Morianton and his dissenters 
are defeated by Teancum—Nephihah 
dies, and his son Pahoran fills the judg-
ment seat. About 72–67 b.c.
And now it came to pass that Moroni 
did not stop making preparations for 
war, or to defend his people against 
the Lamanites; for he caused that 
his armies should commence in the 
commencement  of  the  twentieth 
year of the reign of the judges, that 
they should commence in digging 
up  a heaps  of  earth  round  about 
all  the  cities,  throughout  all  the 
land  which  was  possessed  by  the  
Nephites.

2 And upon the top of these ridges 
of earth he caused that there should 
be a timbers, yea, works of timbers 
built  up  to  the  height  of  a  man, 
round about the cities.

3 And he caused that upon those 
works of timbers there should be 
a frame of pickets built upon the 
timbers round about; and they were 
strong and high.

4 And  he  caused  towers  to  be 
erected that overlooked those works 
of pickets, and he caused places of se-
curity to be built upon those a towers,  
that the stones and the arrows of  
the Lamanites could not hurt them.
5 And  they  were  prepared  that 
they could cast stones from the top 
thereof, according to their pleasure 
and  their  strength,  and  slay  him 
who  should  attempt  to  approach 
near the walls of the city.

6 Thus Moroni did prepare strong-
holds against the coming of their 
enemies, round about every city in 
all the land.

7 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused  that  his  armies  should  go 

forth into the east wilderness; yea, 
and they went forth and drove all 
the Lamanites who were in the east 
wilderness  into  their  own  lands, 
which  were  a south  of  the  land  of 
Zarahemla.

8 And the land of a Nephi did run 
in a straight course from the east 
sea to the west.

9 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni had driven all the Laman-
ites  out  of  the  east  wilderness, 
which  was  north  of  the  lands  of 
their  own  possessions,  he  caused 
that  the  inhabitants  who  were  in 
the land of Zarahemla and in the 
land round about should go forth 
into the east wilderness, even to the 
borders by the seashore, and possess  
the land.

10 And he also placed armies on 
the  south,  in  the  borders  of  their 
possessions,  and  caused  them  to 
erect a fortifications that they might 
secure their armies and their people 
from the hands of their enemies.

11 And  thus  he  cut  off  all  the 
strongholds  of  the  Lamanites  in  
the east wilderness, yea, and also 
on  the  west,  fortifying  the  line 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites, between the land of Zara-
hemla and the land of Nephi, from 
the west sea, running by the head 
of  the  a river  Sidon—the  Nephites 
possessing all the land b northward, 
yea,  even  all  the  land  which  was 
northward  of  the  land  Bountiful, 
according to their pleasure.

12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, 
which did increase daily because of 
the assurance of protection which 
his works did bring forth unto them, 
did seek to cut off the strength and 
the power of the Lamanites from off 
the lands of their possessions, that 
they  should  have  no  power  upon 
the lands of their possession.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began the foundation of a

city, and they called the name of 
the city a Moroni; and it was by the 
east sea; and it was on the south by 
the  line  of  the  possessions  of  the 
Lamanites.

14 And  they  also  began  a  foun-
dation for a city between the city 
of  Moroni  and  the  city  of  Aaron, 
joining the borders of Aaron and 
Moroni; and they called the name 
of the city, or the land, a Nephihah.
15 And  they  also  began  in  that 
same year to build many cities on 
the north, one in a particular man-
ner which they called a Lehi, which 
was in the north by the borders of 
the seashore.

16 And thus ended the twentieth 

year.

17 And in these prosperous circum-
stances were the people of Nephi in 
the commencement of the twenty 
and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges over the people of Nephi.

18 And they did prosper a exceed-
ingly, and they became exceedingly 
rich; yea, and they did multiply and 
wax strong in the land.

19 And  thus  we  see  how  merci-
ful and just are all the dealings of 
the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his 
words unto the children of men; yea, 
we can behold that his words are 
veri fied,  even  at  this  time,  which 
he spake unto Lehi, saying:

20 Blessed art thou and thy chil-
dren;  and  they  shall  be  blessed, 
inasmuch  as  they  shall  keep  my 
a commandments  they  shall  pros-
per in the land. But remember, in-
asmuch as they will not keep my 
commandments they shall be b cut 
off from the presence of the Lord.
21 And  we  see  that  these  prom-
ises have been verified to the peo-
ple of Nephi; for it has been their 
quarrelings and their contentions, 
yea,  their  murderings,  and  their 

plunderings,  their  idolatry,  their 
whoredoms,  and  their  abomina-
tions,  which  were  among  them-
selves, which a brought upon them 
their wars and their destructions.

22 And  those  who  were  faithful 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord were delivered at all times, 
whilst  thousands  of  their  wicked 
brethren  have  been  consigned  to 
bondage, or to perish by the sword, 
or to dwindle in unbelief, and min-
gle with the Lamanites.

23 But behold there never was a 
a happier time among the people of 
Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than 
in the days of Moroni, yea, even at 
this  time,  in  the  twenty  and  first 
year of the reign of the judges.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
twenty and second year of the reign 
of the judges also ended in peace; 
yea, and also the twenty and third 
year.

25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  in 
the commencement of the twenty 
and fourth year of the reign of the 
judges, there would also have been 
peace among the people of Nephi 
had  it  not  been  for  a  a contention 
which took place among them con-
cerning the land of b Lehi, and the 
land  of  c Morianton,  which  joined 
upon the borders of Lehi; both of 
which were on the borders by the 
seashore.

26 For  behold,  the  people  who 
possessed  the  land  of  Morianton 
did claim a part of the land of Lehi; 
therefore there began to be a warm 
a contention  between  them,  inso-
much that the people of Morianton 
took up arms against their breth-
ren, and they were determined by 
the sword to slay them.

27 But behold, the people who pos-
sessed the land of Lehi fled to the 
camp of Moroni, and appealed unto

him for assistance; for behold they 
were not in the wrong.

28 And it came to pass that when 
the people of Morianton, who were 
led by a man whose name was Mori-
anton, found that the people of Lehi 
had  fled  to  the  camp  of  Moroni, 
they were exceedingly fearful lest 
the  army  of  Moroni  should  come 
upon them and destroy them.

29 Therefore, Morianton put it into 
their hearts that they should flee 
to the land which was northward, 
which was covered with a large bod-
ies of water, and take possession of 
the land which was b northward.

30 And behold, they would have 
carried this plan into effect, (which 
would  have  been  a  cause  to  have 
been lamented) but behold, Mori-
anton being a man of much passion, 
therefore he was angry with one of 
his maid servants, and he fell upon 
her and beat her much.

31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  she 
fled, and came over to the camp of 
Moroni, and told Moroni all things 
concerning  the  matter,  and  also 
concerning their intentions to flee 
into the land northward.

32 Now  behold,  the  people  who 
were in the land Bountiful, or rather 
Moroni,  feared  that  they  would 
hearken  to  the  words  of  Morian-
ton and unite with his people, and 
thus  he  would  obtain  possession 
of  those  parts  of  the  land,  which 
would lay a foundation for serious 
consequences among the people of 
Nephi,  yea,  which  a consequences 
would lead to the overthrow of their  
b liberty.

33 Therefore Moroni sent an army, 
with their camp, to head the people 
of  Morianton,  to  stop  their  flight 
into the land northward.

34 And it came to pass that they 
did not a head them until they had 

come  to  the  borders  of  the  land 
b Desolation;  and  there  they  did 
head  them,  by  the  narrow  pass 
which led by the sea into the land 
northward, yea, by the sea, on the 
west and on the east.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
army  which  was  sent  by  Moroni, 
which  was  led  by  a  man  whose 
name was Teancum, did meet the 
people of Morianton; and so stub-
born were the people of Morianton, 
(being inspired by his wickedness 
and  his  a flattering  words)  that  a 
battle commenced between them, 
in  the  which  Teancum  did  b slay 
Morianton and defeat his army, and 
took them prisoners, and returned 
to  the  camp  of  Moroni.  And  thus 
ended the twenty and fourth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

36 And  thus  were  the  people  of 
Morianton brought back. And upon 
their a covenanting to keep the peace 
they  were  restored  to  the  land  of 
Morianton, and a union took place 
between  them  and  the  people  of 
Lehi; and they were also restored 
to their lands.

37 And it came to pass that in the 
same year that the people of Nephi 
had peace restored unto them, that 
Nephihah, the a second chief judge, 
died,  having  filled  the  judgment-
seat with b perfect uprightness be-
fore God.

38 Nevertheless,  he  had  refused 
Alma  to  take  possession  of  those 
a records  and  those  things  which 
were  esteemed  by  Alma  and  his 
fathers to be most sacred; therefore 
Alma had conferred b them upon his 
son, Helaman.

39 Behold, it came to pass that the 
son of Nephihah was appointed to 
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead 
of his father; yea, he was appointed

chief judge and a governor over the 
people, with an b oath and sacred or-
dinance to judge righteously, and to 
keep the peace and the c freedom of 
the people, and to grant unto them 
their sacred privileges to worship 
the Lord their God, yea, to support 
and maintain the cause of God all 
his days, and to bring the wicked 
to justice according to their crime.
40 Now behold, his name was a Pa-
horan. And Pahoran did fill the seat 
of  his  father,  and  did  commence 
his reign in the end of the twenty 
and  fourth  year,  over  the  people  
of Nephi.

CHAPTER 51
The king-men seek to change the law 
and  set  up  a  king—Pahoran  and  the 
freemen are supported by the voice of 
the people—Moroni compels the king-
men to defend their country or be put 
to death—Amalickiah and the Laman-
ites capture many fortified cities—Te-
ancum  repels  the  Lamanite  invasion 
and slays Amalickiah in his tent. About  
67–66 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement of the twenty and 
fifth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, they hav-
ing established peace between the 
people  of  Lehi  and  the  people  of 
Morianton concerning their lands, 
and having commenced the twenty 
and fifth year in a peace;

2 Nevertheless, they did not long 
maintain an entire peace in the land,  
for there began to be a contention 
among the people concerning the 
chief  judge  Pahoran;  for  behold, 
there were a part of the people who 
desired that a few particular points 
of the a law should be altered.

3 But behold, Pahoran would not 
alter nor suffer the law to be altered; 

therefore,  he  did  not  hearken  to 
those who had sent in their voices 
with their petitions concerning the 
altering of the law.

4 Therefore,  those  who  were  de-
sirous  that  the  law  should  be  al-
tered  were  angry  with  him,  and 
desired that he should no longer be 
chief judge over the land; therefore 
there  arose  a  warm  a dispute  con-
cerning  the  matter,  but  not  unto  
bloodshed.

5 And it came to pass that those 
who  were  desirous  that  Pahoran 
should  be  dethroned  from  the  
judgment-seat  were  called  a king-
men, for they were desirous that the 
law should be altered in a manner to 
overthrow the free government and 
to establish a b king over the land.

6 And  those  who  were  desirous 
that Pahoran should remain chief 
judge over the land took upon them 
the name of  a freemen; and thus was 
the b division among them, for the 
freemen had sworn or c covenanted 
to  maintain  their  rights  and  the 
privileges of their religion by a free 
government.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  this 
matter of their contention was set-
tled  by  the  a voice  of  the  people. 
And it came to pass that the voice 
of the people came in favor of the 
freemen,  and  Pahoran  retained 
the  judgment-seat,  which  caused 
much  rejoicing  among  the  breth-
ren  of  Pahoran  and  also  many  of 
the people of liberty, who also put 
the king-men to silence, that they 
durst not oppose but were obliged 
to maintain the cause of freedom.
8 Now  those  who  were  in  favor 
of kings were those of a high birth, 
and they sought to be  b kings; and 
they were supported by those who 
sought  power  and  authority  over 
the people.

9 But  behold,  this  was  a  critical 
time  for  such  contentions  to  be 
among the people of Nephi; for be-
hold, Amalickiah had again a stirred 
up the hearts of the people of the 
Lamanites  against  the  people  of  
the Nephites, and he was gathering 
together soldiers from all parts of 
his land, and arming them, and pre-
paring for war with all diligence; for 
he had  b sworn to drink the blood 
of Moroni.

10 But  behold,  we  shall  see  that 
his  promise  which  he  made  was 
a rash; nevertheless, he did prepare 
himself and his armies to come to 
battle against the Nephites.

11 Now  his  armies  were  not  so 
great as they had hitherto been, be-
cause of the many thousands who 
had been a slain by the hand of the 
Nephites; but notwithstanding their 
great loss, Amalickiah had gathered 
together a wonderfully great army, 
insomuch that he feared not to come 
down to the land of Zarahemla.

12 Yea, even Amalickiah did him-
self come down, at the head of the 
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty 
and fifth year of the reign of the 
judges; and it was at the same time 
that  they  had  begun  to  settle  the 
affairs  of  their  contentions  con-
cerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

13 And it came to pass that when 
the  men  who  were  called  king-
men  had  heard  that  the  Laman-
ites  were  coming  down  to  battle 
against them, they were glad in their 
hearts; and they refused to take up 
arms, for they were so wroth with 
the chief judge, and also with the 
a people of b liberty, that they would 
not  take  up  arms  to  defend  their  
country.

14 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni saw this, and also saw that 
the Lamanites were coming into the 
borders of the land, he was exceed-
ingly wroth because of the  a stub-

bornness of those people whom he 
had labored with so much diligence 
to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly 
wroth; his soul was filled with an-
ger against them.

15 And it came to pass that he sent 
a petition, with the voice of the peo-
ple, unto the governor of the land,  
desiring that he should read it, and 
give him (Moroni) power to compel 
those  dissenters  to  defend  their 
country or to put them to death.

16 For it was his first care to put 
an  end  to  such  contentions  and 
dissensions among the people; for 
behold,  this  had  been  hitherto  a 
cause of all their destruction. And 
it came to pass that it was granted 
according to the voice of the people.
17 And it came to pass that Moroni 
commanded that his army should 
go against those king-men, to pull 
down their pride and their nobil-
ity and level them with the earth, 
or  they  should  take  up  arms  and 
support the cause of liberty.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies  did  march  forth  against 
them; and they did pull down their 
pride and their nobility, insomuch 
that as they did lift their weapons 
of war to fight against the men of 
Moroni they were hewn down and 
leveled to the earth.

19 And it came to pass that there 
were four thousand of those  a dis-
senters who were hewn down by the 
sword;  and  those  of  their  leaders 
who were not slain in battle were 
taken  and  b cast  into  prison,  for 
there was no time for their trials at  
this period.

20 And  the  remainder  of  those 
dissenters, rather than be smitten 
down  to  the  earth  by  the  sword, 
yielded to the standard of liberty, 
and  were  compelled  to  hoist  the 
a title of liberty upon their towers, 
and in their cities, and to take up 
arms in defence of their country.

21 And thus Moroni put an end to 
those king-men, that there were not 
any  known  by  the  appellation  of 
king-men; and thus he put an end 
to the stubbornness and the pride 
of those people who professed the 
blood  of  nobility;  but  they  were 
brought  down  to  humble  them-
selves like unto their brethren, and 
to fight a valiantly for their freedom 
from bondage.

22 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
while  Moroni  was  thus  breaking 
down  the  wars  and  contentions 
among his own people, and subject-
ing them to peace and civilization, 
and making regulations to prepare 
for war against the Lamanites, be-
hold, the Lamanites had come into 
the a land of Moroni, which was in 
the borders by the seashore.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  were  not  sufficiently 
strong in the city of Moroni; there-
fore  Amalickiah  did  drive  them, 
slaying many. And it came to pass 
that Amalickiah took possession of 
the city, yea, possession of all their 
fortifications.

24 And those who fled out of the 
a city of Moroni came to the city of 
Nephihah; and also the people of 
the city of Lehi gathered themselves 
together,  and  made  preparations 
and were ready to receive the La-
manites to battle.

25 But it came to pass that Amalick-
iah would not suffer the Lamanites 
to go against the city of Nephihah 
to battle, but kept them down by 
the seashore, leaving men in every 
city to maintain and defend it.

26 And  thus  he  went  on,  taking 
possession of a many cities, the city 
of b Nephihah, and the city of  c Lehi, 
and  the  city  of  d Morianton,  and 
the city of Omner, and the city of 
e Gid, and the city of f  Mulek, all of 

which were on the east borders by 
the seashore.

27 And  thus  had  the  Lamanites 
obtained, by the cunning of Amal-
ickiah,  so  many  cities,  by  their 
numberless hosts, all of which were 
strongly fortified after the manner 
of the a fortifications of Moroni; all 
of which afforded strongholds for 
the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that they 
marched to the a borders of the land 
Bountiful, driving the Nephites be-
fore them and slaying many.

29 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were  met  by  Teancum,  who  had 
a slain Morianton and had b headed 
his people in his flight.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
headed Amalickiah also, as he was 
marching forth with his numerous 
army that he might take possession 
of the land Bountiful, and also the 
land a northward.

31 But behold he met with a dis-
appointment  by  being  repulsed 
by Teancum and his men, for they 
were great warriors; for every man 
of  Teancum  did  exceed  the  La-
manites  in  their  strength  and  in 
their  skill  of  war,  insomuch  that 
they  did  gain  advantage  over  the  
Lamanites.

32 And it came to pass that they 
did  harass  them,  insomuch  that  
they did slay them even until it was 
dark. And it came to pass that Te-
ancum and his men did pitch their 
tents  in  the  borders  of  the  land  
Bountiful;  and  Amalickiah  did 
pitch  his  tents  in  the  borders  on 
the beach by the seashore, and after  
this manner were they driven.

33 And it came to pass that when 
the night had come, Teancum and 
his servant stole forth and went out 
by night, and went into the camp 
of  Amalickiah;  and  behold,  sleep

had  overpowered  them  because 
of their much fatigue, which was 
caused  by  the  labors  and  heat  of 
the day.

34 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum  stole  privily  into  the  tent  of 
the king, and a put a javelin to his 
heart; and he did cause the b death 
of the king immediately that he did 
not awake his servants.

35 And he returned again privily 
to his own camp, and behold, his 
men  were  asleep,  and  he  awoke 
them and told them all the things 
that he had done.

36 And he caused that his armies 
should  stand  in  a readiness,  lest 
the Lamanites had awakened and 
should come upon them.

37 And thus endeth the twenty and 
fifth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi; and thus 
endeth the days of Amalickiah.

CHAPTER 52
Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah as king 
of the Lamanites—Moroni, Teancum, 
and Lehi lead the Nephites in a victo-
rious war against the Lamanites—The 
city of Mulek is retaken, and Jacob the 
Zoramite is slain. About 66–64 b.c.
And  now,  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
twenty and sixth year of the reign of 
the judges over the people of Nephi, 
behold, when the Lamanites awoke 
on  the  first  morning  of  the  first 
month, behold, they found Amal-
ickiah  was  dead  in  his  own  tent; 
and  they  also  saw  that  Teancum 
was a ready to give them battle on  
that day.

2 And now, when the Lamanites 
saw this they were affrighted; and 
they  abandoned  their  design  in 
marching into the land northward, 
and retreated with all their army 
into the city of a Mulek, and sought 
protection in their fortifications.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a brother  of  Amalickiah  was  ap-
pointed king over the people; and 
his name was b Ammoron; thus king 
Ammoron, the brother of king Amal-
ickiah,  was  appointed  to  reign  in 
his stead.

4 And it came to pass that he did 
command  that  his  people  should 
maintain those cities, which they 
had taken by the shedding of blood; 
for  they  had  not  taken  any  cities 
save they had lost much blood.

5 And  now,  Teancum  saw  that 
the  Lamanites  were  determined 
to  maintain  those  cities  which 
they had taken, and those parts of 
the land which they had obtained 
possession of; and also seeing the 
enormity of their number, Teancum 
thought it was not expedient that 
he should attempt to attack them in  
their forts.

6 But he kept his men round about, 
as if making preparations for war; 
yea, and truly he was preparing to 
defend  himself  against  them,  by 
a casting up walls round about and 
preparing places of resort.

7 And it came to pass that he kept 
thus preparing for war until Moroni 
had sent a large number of men to 
strengthen his army.

8 And Moroni also sent orders unto 
him  that  he  should  retain  all  the 
prisoners who fell into his hands; for 
as the Lamanites had taken many 
prisoners, that he should retain all 
the prisoners of the Lamanites as 
a a ransom for those whom the La-
manites had taken.

9 And  he  also  sent  orders  unto 
him that he should fortify the land 
a Bountiful, and secure the b narrow 
pass which led into the land c north-
ward,  lest  the  Lamanites  should 
obtain that point and should have 
power  to  harass  them  on  every  
side.

10 And Moroni also sent unto him, 
desiring him that he would be a faith-
ful in maintaining that quarter of 
the  land,  and  that  he  would  seek 
every  opportunity  to  scourge  the 
Lamanites in that quarter, as much 
as was in his power, that perhaps he 
might take again by stratagem or 
some other way those cities which 
had been taken out of their hands; 
and that he also would fortify and 
strengthen the cities round about, 
which had not fallen into the hands 
of the Lamanites.

11 And  he  also  said  unto  him,  I 
would come unto you, but behold, 
the Lamanites are upon us in the 
borders  of  the  land  by  the  west 
sea; and behold, I go against them, 
therefore I cannot come unto you.
12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had 
a departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, and had made known unto 
the queen concerning the death of  
his brother, and had gathered to-
gether a large number of men, and  
had marched forth against the Neph-
ites on the borders by the west sea.
13 And thus he was endeavoring 
to harass the Nephites, and to draw 
away a part of their forces to that 
part of the land, while he had com-
manded  those  whom  he  had  left 
to possess the cities which he had 
taken, that they should also harass 
the Nephites on the borders by the 
east sea, and should take possession 
of their lands as much as it was in 
their power, according to the power 
of their armies.

14 And thus were the Nephites in 
those dangerous circumstances in 
the ending of the twenty and sixth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

15 But behold, it came to pass in 
the twenty and seventh year of the 
reign of the judges, that Teancum, 
by the command of Moroni—who 
had established armies to protect 
the south and the west borders of 
the land, and had begun his march 

towards  the  land  Bountiful,  that 
he might assist Teancum with his 
men  in  retaking  the  cities  which 
they had lost—

16 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum had received orders to make 
an attack upon the city of Mulek, 
and retake it if it were possible.

17 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum made preparations to make an 
attack upon the city of Mulek, and 
march forth with his army against 
the Lamanites; but he saw that it was 
impossible that he could overpower 
them while they were in their for-
tifications; therefore he abandoned 
his designs and returned again to 
the city Bountiful, to wait for the 
coming  of  Moroni,  that  he  might 
receive strength to his army.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni  did  arrive  with  his  army  at 
the land of Bountiful, in the latter 
end of the twenty and seventh year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

19 And in the commencement of 
the  twenty  and  eighth  year,  Mo-
roni and Teancum and many of the 
chief  a captains  held  a  council  of 
war—what they should do to cause 
the Lamanites to come out against 
them to battle; or that they might 
by some means flatter them out of 
their strongholds, that they might 
gain advantage over them and take 
again the city of Mulek.

20 And it came to pass they sent 
embassies  to  the  army  of  the  La-
manites, which protected the city 
of  Mulek,  to  their  leader,  whose 
name was Jacob, desiring him that 
he would come out with his armies 
to meet them upon the plains be-
tween  the  two  cities.  But  behold, 
Jacob, who was a a Zoramite, would 
not come out with his army to meet 
them upon the plains.

21 And it came to pass that Moroni, 
having no hopes of meeting them 
upon fair grounds, therefore, he re-
solved upon a plan that he might

a decoy the Lamanites out of their 
strongholds.

22 Therefore  he  caused  that  Te-
ancum  should  take  a  small  num-
ber of men and march down near 
the  seashore;  and  Moroni  and  his 
army,  by  night,  marched  in  the 
wilderness, on the west of the city 
a Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, 
when the guards of the Lamanites 
had discovered Teancum, they ran 
and told it unto Jacob, their leader.
23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Lamanites did march 
forth against Teancum, supposing 
by their numbers to overpower Te-
ancum because of the smallness of 
his numbers. And as Teancum saw 
the armies of the Lamanites coming 
out against him he began to retreat 
down by the seashore, northward.
24 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites saw that he began 
to flee, they took courage and pur-
sued them with vigor. And while 
Teancum  was  thus  leading  away 
the  Lamanites  who  were  pursu-
ing them in vain, behold, Moroni 
commanded that a part of his army 
who were with him should march 
forth into the city, and take pos-
session of it.

25 And  thus  they  did,  and  slew 
all those who had been left to pro-
tect  the  city,  yea,  all  those  who 
would not a yield up their weapons  
of war.

26 And thus Moroni had obtained 
possession of the city Mulek with a 
part of his army, while he marched 
with the remainder to meet the La-
manites when they should return 
from the pursuit of Teancum.

27 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did pursue Teancum until 
they came near the city Bountiful, 
and  then  they  were  met  by  Lehi 
and a small army, which had been 
left to protect the city Bountiful.

28 And  now  behold,  when  the 
chief captains of the Lamanites had  
beheld Lehi with his army coming 

against them, they fled in much con-
fusion, lest perhaps they should not 
obtain the city Mulek before Lehi 
should overtake them; for they were 
wearied because of their march, and 
the men of Lehi were fresh.

29 Now  the  Lamanites  did  not 
know that Moroni had been in their 
rear  with  his  army;  and  all  they 
feared was Lehi and his men.

30 Now Lehi was not desirous to 
overtake them till they should meet 
Moroni and his army.

31 And it came to pass that before 
the Lamanites had retreated far they 
were surrounded by the Nephites,  
by the men of Moroni on one hand, 
and the men of Lehi on the other, 
all of whom were fresh and full of 
strength;  but  the  Lamanites  were 
wearied because of their long march.
32 And  Moroni  commanded  his 
men  that  they  should  fall  upon 
them until they had given up their 
weapons of war.

33 And it came to pass that Jacob,  
being  their  leader,  being  also  a 
a Zoramite,  and  having  an  uncon-
querable spirit, he led the Laman-
ites forth to battle with exceeding 
fury against Moroni.

34 Moroni being in their course of 
march, therefore Jacob was deter-
mined to slay them and cut his way 
through to the city of Mulek. But 
behold, Moroni and his men were 
more powerful; therefore they did 
not give way before the Lamanites.
35 And it came to pass that they 
fought on both hands with exceed-
ing fury; and there were many slain 
on both sides; yea, and Moroni was 
wounded and Jacob was killed.

36 And  Lehi  pressed  upon  their 
rear with such fury with his strong 
men, that the Lamanites in the rear 
delivered up their weapons of war; 
and the remainder of them, being 
much confused, knew not whither 
to go or to strike.

37 Now Moroni seeing their con-
fusion, he said unto them: If ye will

bring  forth  your  weapons  of  war 
and  deliver  them  up,  behold  we 
will forbear shedding your blood.
38 And it came to pass that when 
the  Lamanites  had  heard  these 
words, their chief captains, all those 
who were not slain, came forth and 
threw down their weapons of war 
a at the feet of Moroni, and also com-
manded their men that they should 
do the same.

39 But  behold,  there  were  many 
that  would  not;  and  those  who 
would not deliver up their swords 
were  taken  and  bound,  and  their 
weapons  of  war  were  taken  from 
them, and they were compelled to 
march  with  their  brethren  forth 
into the land Bountiful.

40 And now the number of prison-
ers who were taken exceeded more 
than the number of those who had 
been  slain,  yea,  more  than  those 
who had been slain on both sides.

CHAPTER 53

The Lamanite prisoners are used to 
fortify  the  city  Bountiful—Dissen-
sions among the Nephites give rise to 
Lamanite victories—Helaman takes 
command of the two thousand strip-
ling  sons  of  the  people  of  Ammon.  
About 64–63 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
set guards over the prisoners of the 
Lamanites, and did compel them to 
go forth and bury their dead, yea, 
and also the dead of the Nephites 
who were slain; and Moroni placed 
men  over  them  to  guard  them 
while  they  should  perform  their  
labors.

2 And Moroni went to the city of 
Mulek  with  Lehi,  and  took  com-
mand of the city and gave it unto 
Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a 
man who had been with Moroni in 
the more part of all his battles; and 
he  was  a  man  a like  unto  Moroni, 
and  they  rejoiced  in  each  other’s  

safety;  yea,  they  were  beloved  by 
each other, and also beloved by all 
the people of Nephi.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
the Lamanites had finished burying  
their dead and also the dead of the 
Nephites, they were marched back 
into the land Bountiful; and Tean-
cum, by the orders of Moroni, caused 
that they should commence laboring 
in a digging a ditch round about the 
land, or the city, b Bountiful.

4 And he caused that they should 
build a a breastwork of timbers upon 
the inner bank of the ditch; and they 
cast up dirt out of the ditch against 
the breastwork of timbers; and thus 
they  did  cause  the  Lamanites  to 
labor until they had encircled the 
city of Bountiful round about with 
a strong wall of timbers and earth, 
to an exceeding height.

5 And this city became an exceed-
ing stronghold ever after; and in this 
city they did guard the prisoners of 
the Lamanites; yea, even within a 
wall which they had caused them to 
a build with their own hands. Now 
Moroni was compelled to cause the 
Lamanites to labor, because it was 
easy to guard them while at their 
labor; and he desired all his forces 
when  he  should  make  an  attack 
upon the Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Moroni 
had thus gained a victory over one 
of the greatest of the armies of the 
Lamanites, and had obtained pos-
session of the city of  a Mulek, which 
was  one  of  the  strongest  holds  of 
the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; 
and thus he had also built a strong-
hold to retain his prisoners.

7 And it came to pass that he did 
no more attempt a battle with the 
Lamanites in that year, but he did 
employ  his  men  in  preparing  for 
war, yea, and in making fortifica-
tions to guard against the Lamanites, 
yea, and also delivering their women 
and their children from famine and

affliction, and providing food for 
their armies.

8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
the armies of the Lamanites, on the 
west sea, south, while in the absence 
of Moroni on account of some in-
trigue amongst the Nephites, which 
caused a dissensions amongst them, 
had gained some ground over the 
Nephites, yea, insomuch that they 
had obtained possession of a num-
ber  of  their  cities  in  that  part  of  
the land.

9 And  thus  because  of  a iniquity 
amongst themselves, yea, because 
of dissensions and intrigue among 
themselves they were placed in the 
most dangerous circumstances.

10 And now behold, I have some-
what to say concerning the a people 
of Ammon, who, in the beginning, 
were  Lamanites;  but  by  Ammon 
and his brethren, or rather by the 
power and word of God, they had 
been b converted unto the Lord; and 
they had been brought down into 
the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and  had 
ever  since  been  protected  by  the 
Nephites.

11 And because of their oath they 
had been kept from taking up arms 
against their brethren; for they had 
taken an oath that they a never would 
shed  blood  more;  and  according 
to their oath they would have per-
ished; yea, they would have suffered 
themselves to have fallen into the 
hands of their brethren, had it not 
been for the pity and the exceeding 
love which Ammon and his breth-
ren had had for them.

12 And  for  this  cause  they  were 
brought  down  into  the  land  of 
Zara hemla; and they ever had been 
a protected by the Nephites.

13 But it came to pass that when 
they saw the danger, and the many 
a afflictions and tribulations which 
the  Nephites  bore  for  them,  they 

were moved with compassion and 
were b desirous to take up arms in 
the defence of their country.

14 But behold, as they were about 
to take their weapons of war, they 
were  overpowered  by  the  persua-
sions of Helaman and his brethren, 
for they were about to  a break the 
b oath which they had made.

15 And  Helaman  feared  lest  by 
so  doing  they  should  lose  their 
souls; therefore all those who had 
entered  into  this  covenant  were 
compelled to behold their brethren 
wade through their afflictions, in 
their  dangerous  circumstances  at  
this time.

16 But  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
they had many a sons, who had not 
entered into a covenant that they 
would  not  take  their  weapons  of 
war to defend themselves against 
their  enemies;  therefore  they  did 
assemble themselves together at this 
time, as many as were able to take 
up arms, and they called themselves  
Nephites.

17 And  they  entered  into  a  cov-
enant to fight for the liberty of the 
Nephites, yea, to protect the land 
unto the a laying down of their lives; 
yea, even they covenanted that they 
never would give up their b liberty, 
but they would fight in all cases to 
protect the Nephites and themselves 
from bondage.

18 Now  behold,  there  were  two 
thousand of those young men, who 
entered into this covenant and took 
their  weapons  of  war  to  defend 
their country.

19 And now behold, as they never 
had hitherto been a disadvantage 
to the Nephites, they became now 
at this period of time also a great 
support; for they took their weap-
ons  of  war,  and  they  would  that 
Helaman should be their leader.

20 And they were all young men,

and they were exceedingly valiant 
for a courage, and also for strength 
and activity; but behold, this was 
not all—they were men who were 
true at all times in whatsoever thing 
they were entrusted.

21 Yea, they were men of truth and 
a soberness, for they had been taught 
to keep the commandments of God 
and to b walk uprightly before him.
22 And now it came to pass that 
Helaman did march at the head of 
his a two thousand stripling soldiers, 
to the support of the people in the 
borders of the land on the south by 
the west sea.

23 And  thus  ended  the  twenty 
and eighth year of the reign of the 
judges over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 54

Ammoron and Moroni negotiate for the 
exchange of prisoners—Moroni demands 
that the Lamanites withdraw and cease 
their  murderous  attacks—Ammoron 
demands  that  the  Nephites  lay  down 
their arms and become subject to the 
Lamanites. About 63 b.c.

And now it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the twenty and ninth 
year of the judges, that a Ammoron 
sent unto Moroni desiring that he 
would exchange prisoners.

2 And it came to pass that Moroni 
felt to a rejoice exceedingly at this 
request,  for  he  desired  the  provi-
sions which were imparted for the 
support of the Lamanite prisoners 
for  the  support  of  his  own  peo-
ple;  and  he  also  desired  his  own 
people  for  the  strengthening  of  
his army.

3 Now  the  Lamanites  had  taken 
many  women  and  children,  and 
there was not a woman nor a child 
among all the prisoners of Moroni, 
or the prisoners whom Moroni had 
taken;  therefore  Moroni  resolved 

upon a stratagem to obtain as many 
prisoners of the Nephites from the 
Lamanites as it were possible.

4 Therefore  he  wrote  an  epistle, 
and sent it by the servant of Am-
moron, the same who had brought 
an  epistle  to  Moroni.  Now  these 
are the words which he wrote unto 
Ammoron, saying:

5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written 
unto you somewhat concerning this 
war which ye have waged against 
my  people,  or  rather  which  thy 
a brother hath waged against them, 
and which ye are still determined 
to carry on after his death.

6 Behold, I would tell you some-
what  concerning  the  a justice  of 
God, and the sword of his almighty 
wrath, which doth hang over you 
except ye repent and withdraw your 
armies into your own lands, or the 
land of your possessions, which is 
the land of Nephi.

7 Yea, I would tell you these things 
if  ye  were  capable  of  hearkening 
unto  them;  yea,  I  would  tell  you 
concerning  that  awful  a hell  that 
awaits to receive such b murderers 
as thou and thy brother have been, 
except  ye  repent  and  withdraw 
your  murderous  purposes,  and 
return  with  your  armies  to  your  
own lands.

8 But as ye have once rejected these 
things, and have fought against the 
people of the Lord, even so I may 
expect you will do it again.

9 And now behold, we are prepared 
to receive you; yea, and except you 
withdraw your purposes, behold, ye 
will pull down the  a wrath of that 
God whom you have rejected upon 
you, even to your utter destruction.
10 But,  as  the  Lord  liveth,  our 
armies shall come upon you except 
ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be 
visited with a death, for we will re-
tain our cities and our lands; yea,

and we will maintain our religion 
and the cause of our God.

11 But  behold,  it  supposeth  me 
that I talk to you concerning these 
things in vain; or it supposeth me 
that thou art a a child of hell; there-
fore I will close my epistle by tell-
ing  you  that  I  will  not  exchange 
prisoners, save it be on conditions 
that ye will deliver up a man and 
his wife and his children, for one 
prisoner; if this be the case that ye 
will do it, I will exchange.

12 And behold, if ye do not this, 
I  will  come  against  you  with  my 
armies;  yea,  even  I  will  arm  my 
women and my children, and I will 
come against you, and I will follow 
you even into your own land, which 
is the land of  a our first inheritance; 
yea, and it shall be blood for blood, 
yea, life for life; and I will give you 
battle even until you are destroyed 
from off the face of the earth.

13 Behold, I am in my anger, and 
also my people; ye have sought to 
a murder us, and we have only sought 
to defend ourselves. But behold, if 
ye seek to destroy us more we will 
seek  to  destroy  you;  yea,  and  we 
will seek our land, the land of our 
first inheritance.

14 Now  I  close  my  epistle.  I  am 
Moroni; I am a leader of the people 
of the Nephites.

15 Now it came to pass that Am-
moron, when he had received this 
epistle,  was  angry;  and  he  wrote 
another  epistle  unto  Moroni,  and 
these are the words which he wrote, 
saying:

16 I am Ammoron, the king of the 
Lamanites; I am the brother of Amal-
ickiah  whom  ye  have  a murdered. 
Behold, I will avenge his blood upon 
you, yea, and I will come upon you 
with my armies for I fear not your 
threatenings.

17 For  behold,  your  fathers  did 
wrong  their  brethren,  insomuch 

that  they  did  rob  them  of  their 
a right to the b government when it 
rightly belonged unto them.

18 And now behold, if ye will lay 
down your arms, and subject your-
selves  to  be  governed  by  those  to 
whom the government doth rightly 
belong, then will I cause that my 
people shall lay down their weap-
ons and shall be at war no more.

19 Behold, ye have breathed out 
many threatenings against me and 
my people; but behold, we fear not 
your threatenings.

20 Nevertheless, I will grant to ex-
change prisoners according to your 
request, gladly, that I may preserve 
my  food  for  my  men  of  war;  and 
we will wage a war which shall be 
eternal, either to the subjecting the 
Nephites to our authority or to their 
eternal extinction.

21 And  as  concerning  that  God 
whom ye say we have rejected, be-
hold, we a know not such a being; nei-
ther do ye; but if it so be that there 
is such a being, we know not but  
that he hath made us as well as you.
22 And if it so be that there is a 
devil and a hell, behold will he not 
send  you  there  to  dwell  with  my 
brother whom ye have murdered, 
whom ye have hinted that he hath 
gone  to such  a place? But  behold 
these things matter not.

23 I  am  Ammoron,  and  a  de-
scendant  of  a Zoram,  whom  your 
fathers pressed and brought out of  
Jerusalem.

24 And behold now, I am a bold 
Lamanite;  behold,  this  war  hath 
been waged to avenge their wrongs, 
and a to maintain and to obtain their 
rights to the government; and I close 
my epistle to Moroni.

to become drunk, and the Nephite pris-
oners are freed—The city of Gid is taken 
without bloodshed. About 63–62 b.c.

Now it came to pass that when Mo-
roni had received this epistle he was 
more angry, because he knew that 
Ammoron had a perfect knowledge 
of his a fraud; yea, he knew that Am-
moron knew that it was not a just 
cause that had caused him to wage 
a war against the people of Nephi.
2 And he said: Behold, I will not 
exchange prisoners with Ammoron 
save he will withdraw his a purpose, 
as I have stated in my epistle; for 
I will not grant unto him that he 
shall  have  any  more  power  than 
what he hath got.

3 Behold, I know the place where 
the Lamanites do guard my people 
whom  they  have  taken  prisoners; 
and as Ammoron would not grant 
unto  me  mine  epistle,  behold,  I 
will give unto him according to my 
words; yea, I will seek death among 
them until they shall sue for peace.
4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Moroni had said these words, 
he caused that a search should be 
made among his men, that perhaps 
he might find a man who was a de-
scendant of Laman among them.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
found one, whose name was Laman; 
and  he  was  a one  of  the  servants 
of the king who was murdered by 
Amalickiah.

6 Now Moroni caused that Laman 
and  a  small  number  of  his  men 
should  go  forth  unto  the  guards 
who were over the Nephites.

7 Now the Nephites were guarded 
in the city of  a Gid; therefore Moroni 
appointed Laman and caused that 
a small number of men should go 
with him.

8 And when it was evening Laman 
went to the guards who were over 
the Nephites, and behold, they saw 

him coming and they hailed him; 
but he saith unto them: Fear not; 
behold,  I  am  a  Lamanite.  Behold, 
we  have  escaped  from  the  Neph-
ites,  and  they  sleep;  and  behold 
we  have  taken  of  their  wine  and 
brought with us.

9 Now when the Lamanites heard 
these words they received him with 
joy; and they said unto him: Give 
us of your wine, that we may drink; 
we are glad that ye have thus taken 
wine with you for we are weary.

10 But  Laman  said  unto  them: 
Let us keep of our wine till we go 
against the Nephites to battle. But 
this saying only made them more 
desirous to drink of the wine;

11 For,  said  they:  We  are  weary, 
therefore let us take of the wine, and 
by and by we shall receive wine for 
our rations, which will strengthen 
us to go against the Nephites.

12 And Laman said unto them: You 
may do according to your desires.
13 And it came to pass that they 
did take of the wine freely; and it 
was pleasant to their taste, therefore 
they took of it more freely; and it 
was strong, having been prepared 
in its a strength.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  they  did 
drink and were merry, and by and 
by they were all a drunken.

15 And now when Laman and his 
men saw that they were all drunken, 
and were in a a deep sleep, they re-
turned to Moroni and told him all 
the things that had happened.

16 And now this was according to 
the design of Moroni. And Moroni 
had prepared his men with weap-
ons of war; and he went to the city 
Gid, while the Lamanites were in a 
deep sleep and drunken, and cast in

when Moroni had armed all those 
prisoners; and all those things were 
done in a profound silence.

18 But had they awakened the La-
manites, behold they were drunken 
and the Nephites could have slain 
them.

19 But  behold,  this  was  not  the  
desire of Moroni; he did not a delight 
in murder or bloodshed, but he de-
lighted in the saving of his people 
from destruction; and for this cause 
he  might  not  bring  upon  him  in-
justice, he would not fall upon the  
Lamanites and destroy them in their 
drunkenness.

20 But he had obtained his desires; 
for he had armed those prisoners of 
the Nephites who were within the 
wall of the city, and had given them 
power to gain possession of those 
parts which were within the walls.
21 And  then  he  caused  the  men 
who were with him to withdraw a 
pace from them, and surround the 
armies of the Lamanites.

22 Now  behold  this  was  done  in 
the  night-time,  so  that  when  the 
Lamanites  awoke  in  the  morning 
they  beheld  that  they  were  sur-
rounded by the Nephites without, 
and that their prisoners were armed  
within.

23 And  thus  they  saw  that  the 
Nephites had power over them; and 
in these circumstances they found 
that it was not expedient that they 
should  fight  with  the  Nephites; 
therefore their chief a captains de-
manded their weapons of war, and 
they brought them forth and b cast 
them  at  the  feet  of  the  Nephites, 
pleading for mercy.

24 Now behold, this was the desire 
of Moroni. He took them prisoners 
of war, and took possession of the 
city, and caused that all the prison-
ers should be liberated, who were 
Nephites;  and  they  did  join  the 
army of Moroni, and were a great 
strength to his army.

25 And it came to pass that he did 
cause the Lamanites, whom he had 
taken  prisoners,  that  they  should 
commence a a labor in strengthen-
ing the fortifications round about 
the city Gid.

26 And it came to pass that when 
he  had  fortified  the  city  Gid,  ac-
cording  to  his  desires,  he  caused 
that his prisoners should be taken 
to the city Bountiful; and he also 
guarded that city with an exceed-
ingly strong force.

27 And it came to pass that they 
did,  notwithstanding  all  the  in-
trigues of the Lamanites, keep and 
protect all the prisoners whom they 
had taken, and also maintain all the 
ground  and  the  advantage  which 
they had retaken.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began a again to be victo-
rious,  and  to  reclaim  their  rights 
and their privileges.

29 Many times did the Lamanites 
attempt to encircle them about by 
night,  but  in  these  attempts  they 
did lose many prisoners.

30 And  many  times  did  they  at-
tempt to administer of their wine 
to  the  Nephites,  that  they  might 
destroy them with poison or with 
drunkenness.

31 But behold, the Nephites were 
not  slow  to  a remember  the  Lord 
their God in this their time of af-
fliction.  They  could  not  be  taken 
in their snares; yea, they would not 
partake of their wine, save they had 
first given to some of the Lamanite 
prisoners.

32 And  they  were  thus  cautious 
that  no  poison  should  be  admin-
istered  among  them;  for  if  their 
wine  would  poison  a  Lamanite  it 
would also poison a Nephite; and 
thus they did try all their liquors.
33 And now it came to pass that it 
was expedient for Moroni to make  
preparations to attack the city  a Mori-
anton;  for  behold,  the  Lamanites

had,  by  their  labors,  fortified  the 
city Morianton until it had become 
an exceeding stronghold.

34 And  they  were  continually 
bringing new forces into that city, 
and also new supplies of provisions.
35 And thus ended the twenty and 
ninth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 56

Helaman sends an epistle to Moroni, 
recounting  the  state  of  the  war  with 
the Lamanites—Antipus and Helaman 
gain a great victory over the Laman-
ites—Helaman’s two thousand stripling 
sons fight with miraculous power, and 
none of them are slain. Verse 1, about 
62 b.c.; verses 2–19, about 66 b.c.; and 
verses 20–57, about 65–64 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement  of  the  thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges, on 
the second day in the first month, 
a Moroni received an  b epistle from 
Helaman, stating the affairs of the 
people in c that quarter of the land.
2 And these are the words which 
he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved 
brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord 
as  in  the  tribulations  of  our  war-
fare; behold, my beloved brother, 
I  have  somewhat  to  tell  you  con-
cerning our warfare in this part of  
the land.

3 Behold, a two thousand of the sons 
of those men whom Ammon brought 
down out of the land of Nephi—now 
ye have known that these were de-
scendants of Laman, who was the 
eldest son of our father Lehi;

4 Now  I  need  not  rehearse  unto 
you concerning their traditions or 
their  unbelief,  for  thou  knowest 
concerning all these things—

5 Therefore  it  sufficeth  me  that 
I  tell  you  that  two  thousand  of 
these young men have taken their  

weapons of war, and would that I 
should be their leader; and we have 
come forth to defend our country.
6 And  now  ye  also  know  con-
cerning the a covenant which their 
fathers made, that they would not 
take up their weapons of war against 
their brethren to shed blood.

7 But in the twenty and sixth year, 
when they saw our afflictions and 
our tribulations for them, they were 
about to a break the covenant which 
they had made and take up their 
weapons of war in our defence.

8 But I would not suffer them that 
they  should  break  this  a covenant 
which  they  had  made,  supposing 
that God would strengthen us, in-
somuch that we should not suffer 
more because of the fulfilling the 
b oath which they had taken.

9 But behold, here is one thing in 
which we may have great joy. For 
behold,  in  the  twenty  and  sixth 
year, I, Helaman, did march at the 
head of these a two thousand young 
men to the city of b Judea, to assist 
Antipus, whom ye had appointed a 
leader over the people of that part 
of the land.

10 And  I  did  join  my  two  thou-
sand a sons, (for they are worthy to 
be called sons) to the army of An-
tipus,  in  which  strength  Antipus 
did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, 
his army had been reduced by the 
Lamanites because their forces had 
slain  a  vast  number  of  our  men, 
for which cause we have to mourn.
11 Nevertheless, we may console 
ourselves  in  this  point,  that  they 
have  died  in  the  cause  of  their 
country and of their God, yea, and 
they are a happy.

12 And the Lamanites had also re-
tained many prisoners, all of whom 
are chief a captains, for none other 
have  they  spared  alive.  And  we 
suppose that they are now at this

time in the land of Nephi; it is so 
if they are not slain.

13 And now these are the cities of 
which the Lamanites have obtained 
possession by the shedding of the 
blood of so many of our valiant men:
14 The land of a Manti, or the city 
of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, 
and  the  city  of  b Cumeni,  and  the 
city of Antiparah.

15 And these are the cities which 
they  possessed  when  I  arrived  at 
the city of Judea; and I found Anti-
pus and his men toiling with their 
might to fortify the city.

16 Yea, and they were depressed 
in body as well as in spirit, for they 
had  fought  valiantly  by  day  and 
toiled  by  night  to  maintain  their 
cities; and thus they had suffered 
great afflictions of every kind.

17 And now they were determined 
to conquer in this place or die; there-
fore you may well suppose that this 
little  force  which  I  brought  with 
me, yea, those a sons of mine, gave 
them great hopes and much joy.

18 And now it came to pass that 
when the Lamanites saw that Anti-
pus had received a greater strength 
to his army, they were compelled 
by the orders of Ammoron to not 
come against the city of Judea, or 
against us, to battle.

19 And  thus  were  we  favored  of 
the Lord; for had they come upon 
us in this our weakness they might 
have  perhaps  destroyed  our  little 
army; but thus were we preserved.
20 They  were  commanded  by 
Ammoron to maintain those cities 
which  they  had  taken.  And  thus 
ended  the  twenty  and  sixth  year. 
And in the commencement of the 
twenty  and  seventh  year  we  had 
prepared our city and ourselves for  
defence.

21 Now  we  were  desirous  that 
the  Lamanites  should  come  upon 
us;  for  we  were  not  desirous  to 
make an attack upon them in their  
strongholds.

22 And it came to pass that we kept 

spies out round about, to watch the 
movements of the Lamanites, that 
they  might  not  pass  us  by  night 
nor by day to make an attack upon 
our other cities which were on the 
northward.

23 For  we  knew  in  those  cities 
they  were  not  sufficiently  strong 
to  meet  them;  therefore  we  were 
desirous, if they should pass by us, 
to fall upon them in their rear, and 
thus bring them up in the rear at 
the same time they were met in the 
front. We supposed that we could 
overpower  them;  but  behold,  we 
were disappointed in this our desire.
24 They durst not pass by us with 
their  whole  army,  neither  durst 
they with a part, lest they should 
not be sufficiently strong and they 
should fall.

25 Neither durst they march down 
against the city of Zarahemla; nei-
ther  durst  they  cross  the  head  of 
Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.
26 And  thus,  with  their  forces, 
they were determined to maintain 
those cities which they had taken.
27 And now it came to pass in the 
second month of this year, there was 
brought  unto  us  many  provisions 
from the fathers of those my two 
thousand sons.

28 And also there were sent two 
thousand  men  unto  us  from  the 
land  of  Zarahemla.  And  thus  we 
were prepared with ten thousand 
men,  and  provisions  for  them, 
and also for their wives and their  
children.

29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing 
our forces increase daily, and pro-
visions arrive for our support, they 
began to be fearful, and began to 
sally forth, if it were possible to put 
an end to our receiving provisions 
and strength.

30 Now  when  we  saw  that  the 
Lamanites  began  to  grow  uneasy 
on  this  wise,  we  were  desirous  to 
bring a stratagem into effect upon 
them;  therefore  Antipus  ordered 
that I should march forth with my  

  14 a  Alma 43:22.

 b  Alma 57:7 (7–34).

  17 a  Alma 56:10.

 
ALMA 56  : 31–47

little sons to a neighboring city, a as 
if we were carrying provisions to a 
neighboring city.

31 And we were to march near the 
city of Antiparah, as if we were go-
ing to the city beyond, in the bor-
ders by the seashore.

32 And it came to pass that we did 
march forth, as if with our provi-
sions, to go to that city.

33 And it came to pass that Anti-
pus did march forth with a part of 
his army, leaving the remainder to 
maintain the city. But he did not 
march forth until I had gone forth 
with my little army, and came near 
the city Antiparah.

34 And now, in the city Antiparah 
were stationed the strongest army 
of  the  Lamanites;  yea,  the  most 
numerous.

35 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  been  informed  by  their 
spies,  they  came  forth  with  their 
army and marched against us.

36 And it came to pass that we did 
flee before them, northward. And 
thus  we  did  lead  away  the  most 
powerful army of the Lamanites;

37 Yea, even to a considerable dis-
tance,  insomuch  that  when  they 
saw the army of Antipus pursuing 
them,  with  their  might,  they  did 
not  turn  to  the  right  nor  to  the 
left, but pursued their march in a 
straight course after us; and, as we 
suppose, it was their intent to slay 
us before Antipus should overtake 
them, and this that they might not 
be surrounded by our people.

38 And  now  Antipus,  beholding 
our danger, did speed the march of 
his army. But behold, it was night; 
therefore  they  did  not  overtake 
us,  neither  did  Antipus  overtake 
them;  therefore  we  did  camp  for  
the night.

39 And it came to pass that before 
the dawn of the morning, behold, 
the  Lamanites  were  pursuing  us. 
Now we were not sufficiently strong 

to contend with them; yea, I would 
not suffer that my little sons should 
fall into their hands; therefore we 
did  continue  our  march,  and  we 
took our march into the wilderness.
40 Now they durst not turn to the 
right nor to the left lest they should 
be surrounded; neither would I turn 
to the right nor to the left lest they 
should overtake me, and we could 
not stand against them, but be slain, 
and they would make their escape; 
and  thus  we  did  flee  all  that  day 
into  the  wilderness,  even  until  it 
was dark.

41 And it came to pass that again, 
when the light of the morning came 
we saw the Lamanites upon us, and 
we did flee before them.

42 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did not pursue us far before they 
halted; and it was in the morning of 
the third day of the seventh month.
43 And  now,  whether  they  were 
overtaken by Antipus we knew not, 
but I said unto my men: Behold, we 
know not but they have halted for 
the purpose that we should come 
against them, that they might catch 
us in their snare;

44 Therefore what say ye, my sons, 

will ye go against them to battle?

45 And  now  I  say  unto  you,  my 
beloved brother Moroni, that never 
had I seen a so great b courage, nay, 
not amongst all the Nephites.

46 For as I had ever called them 
my sons (for they were all of them 
very young) even so they said unto 
me: Father, behold our God is with  
us, and he will a not suffer that we  
should  fall;  then  let  us  go  forth;  
we would not slay our brethren if 
they would let us alone; therefore 
let us go, lest they should overpower 
the army of Antipus.

47 Now  they  never  had  fought, 
yet  they  did  not  fear  death;  and 
they  did  think  more  upon  the 
a liberty of their b fathers than they 
did upon their lives; yea, they had

been taught by their c mothers, that 
if they did not doubt, God would 
deliver them.

48 And  they  rehearsed  unto  me 
the  words  of  their  a mothers,  say-
ing: We b do not doubt our mothers  
knew it.

49 And it came to pass that I did re-
turn with my two thousand against 
these Lamanites who had pursued 
us. And now behold, the armies of 
Antipus had overtaken them, and 
a terrible battle had commenced.

50 The  army  of  Antipus  being 
weary, because of their long march 
in  so  short  a  space  of  time,  were 
about to fall into the hands of the 
Lamanites; and had I not returned 
with my two thousand they would 
have obtained their purpose.

51 For Antipus had fallen by the 
sword, and many of his leaders, be-
cause of their weariness, which was 
occasioned  by  the  speed  of  their 
march—therefore the men of Anti-
pus, being confused because of the 
fall of their leaders, began to give 
way before the Lamanites.

52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites took courage, and began 
to pursue them; and thus were the 
Lamanites pursuing them with great 
vigor  when  a Helaman  came  upon 
their rear with his two thousand, 
and began to slay them exceedingly, 
insomuch that the whole army of 
the  Lamanites  halted  and  turned 
upon Helaman.

53 Now  when  the  people  of  An-
tipus saw that the Lamanites had 
turned them about, they gathered 
together their men and came again 
upon the rear of the Lamanites.

54 And  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  we,  the  people  of  Nephi,  the  
people of Antipus, and I with my 
two  thousand,  did  surround  the 
Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, 
insomuch that they were compelled 
to deliver up their weapons of war 

and  also  themselves  as  prisoners  
of war.

55 And now it came to pass that 
when they had surrendered them-
selves up unto us, behold, I num-
bered  those  young  men  who  had 
fought with me, fearing lest there 
were many of them slain.

56 But  behold,  to  my  great  joy, 
there  had  a not  one  soul  of  them 
fallen  to  the  earth;  yea,  and  they 
had fought as if with the b strength 
of God; yea, never were men known 
to have fought with such miracu-
lous strength; and with such mighty 
power did they fall upon the Laman-
ites,  that  they  did  frighten  them; 
and for this cause did the Lamanites 
deliver themselves up as prisoners  
of war.

57 And as we had no place for our  
prisoners, that we could guard them 
to keep them from the armies of the  
Lamanites, therefore we sent them 
to the land of Zarahemla, and a part 
of  those  men  who  were  not  slain 
of Antipus, with them; and the re-
mainder I took and joined them to 
my stripling a Ammonites, and took 
our march back to the city of Judea.

CHAPTER 57

Helaman  recounts  the  taking  of  An-
tiparah  and  the  surrender  and  later 
the defense of Cumeni—His Ammon-
ite  striplings  fight  valiantly;  all  are 
wounded,  but  none  are  slain—Gid 
reports  the  slaying  and  the  escape  of 
the Lamanite prisoners. About 63 b.c.

And now it came to pass that I re-
ceived an epistle from Ammoron, 
the  king,  stating  that  if  I  would 
deliver  up  those  prisoners  of  war 
whom we had taken that he would 
deliver  up  the  city  of  Antiparah 
unto us.

2 But  I  sent  an  epistle  unto  the 
king, that we were sure our forces 
were sufficient to take the city of

Antiparah by our force; and by de-
livering  up  the  prisoners  for  that 
city  we  should  suppose  ourselves 
unwise, and that we would only de-
liver up our prisoners on exchange.
3 And  Ammoron  refused  mine 
epistle, for he would not exchange 
prisoners;  therefore  we  began  to 
make  preparations  to  go  against 
the city of Antiparah.

4 But the people of Antiparah did 
leave the city, and fled to their other 
cities, which they had possession of, 
to fortify them; and thus the city 
of Antiparah fell into our hands.

5 And  thus  ended  the  twenty 
and  eighth  year  of  the  reign  of  
the judges.

6 And it came to pass that in the 
commencement of the twenty and 
ninth  year,  we  received  a  supply 
of provisions, and also an addition 
to our army, from the land of Zara-
hemla,  and  from  the  land  round 
about, to the number of six thou-
sand men, besides sixty of the a sons 
of the Ammonites who had come to 
join their brethren, my little band 
of two thousand. And now behold, 
we  were  strong,  yea,  and  we  had 
also  plenty  of  provisions  brought  
unto us.

7 And it came to pass that it was 
our desire to wage a battle with the 
army which was placed to protect 
the city a Cumeni.

8 And now behold, I will show unto 
you that we soon accomplished our 
desire; yea, with our strong force, or  
with a part of our strong force, we 
did  surround,  by  night,  the  city 
Cumeni, a little before they were 
to receive a supply of provisions.

9 And it came to pass that we did 
camp round about the city for many 
nights; but we did sleep upon our 
swords, and keep guards, that the 
Lamanites could not come upon us 
by night and slay us, which they at-
tempted many times; but as many 
times as they attempted this their 
blood was spilt.

10 At length their provisions did 

arrive, and they were about to enter 
the city by night. And we, instead 
of being Lamanites, were Nephites; 
therefore,  we  did  take  them  and 
their provisions.

11 And  notwithstanding  the  La-
manites  being  cut  off  from  their 
support after this manner, they were  
still  determined  to  maintain  the 
city; therefore it became expedient 
that we should take those provisions 
and send them to a Judea, and our 
prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.
12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days had passed away before 
the Lamanites began to lose all hopes 
of succor; therefore they yielded up  
the city unto our hands; and thus 
we had accomplished our designs 
in obtaining the city Cumeni.

13 But  it  came  to  pass  that  our 
prisoners  were  so  numerous  that, 
notwithstanding  the  enormity  of 
our  numbers,  we  were  obliged  to 
employ all our force to keep them, 
or to put them to death.

14 For behold, they would break 
out  in  great  numbers,  and  would 
fight with stones, and with clubs, 
or whatsoever thing they could get 
into their hands, insomuch that we 
did slay upwards of two thousand 
of them after they had surrendered 
themselves prisoners of war.

15 Therefore it became expedient 
for us, that we should put an end 
to their lives, or guard them, sword 
in hand, down to the land of Zara-
hemla; and also our provisions were 
not  any  more  than  sufficient  for 
our  own  people,  notwithstanding 
that which we had taken from the  
Lamanites.

16 And now, in those critical cir-
cumstances, it became a very seri-
ous matter to determine concerning 
these prisoners of war; nevertheless, 
we did resolve to send them down 
to  the  land  of  Zarahemla;  there-
fore we selected a part of our men,  
and  gave  them  charge  over  our 
prisoners to go down to the land of  
Zarahemla.

17 But it came to pass that on the 
morrow they did return. And now 
behold, we did not a inquire of them 
concerning  the  prisoners;  for  be-
hold, the Lamanites were upon us, 
and they returned in season to save 
us  from  falling  into  their  hands. 
For behold, Ammoron had sent to 
their support a new supply of pro-
visions and also a numerous army  
of men.

18 And it came to pass that those 
men whom we sent with the pris-
oners did arrive in season to check 
them, as they were about to over-
power us.

19 But behold, my little band of 
two thousand and sixty fought most 
desperately;  yea,  they  were  firm 
before the Lamanites, and did a ad-
minister death unto all those who 
opposed them.

20 And  as  the  remainder  of  our 
army  were  about  to  give  way  be-
fore the Lamanites, behold, those 
two thousand and sixty were firm 
and undaunted.

21 Yea,  and  they  did  a obey  and 
observe  to  perform  every  word 
of  command  with  exactness;  yea, 
and even according to their faith it 
was done unto them; and I did re-
member the words which they said 
unto  me  that  their  b mothers  had  
taught them.

22 And now behold, it was these 
my sons, and those men who had 
been selected to convey the prison-
ers, to whom we owe this great vic-
tory; for it was they who did beat 
the Lamanites; therefore they were 
driven back to the city of Manti.

23 And we retained our city Cu-
meni,  and  were  not  all  destroyed 
by the sword; nevertheless, we had 
suffered great loss.

24 And it came to pass that after 
the  Lamanites  had  fled,  I  imme-
diately  gave  orders  that  my  men 
who had been wounded should be 

taken  from  among  the  dead,  and 
caused  that  their  wounds  should  
be dressed.

25 And it came to pass that there 
were two hundred, out of my two 
thousand and sixty, who had fainted 
because of the loss of blood; never-
theless, according to the goodness of 
God, and to our great astonishment, 
and also the joy of our whole army, 
there was a not one soul of them who 
did  perish;  yea,  and  neither  was 
there  one  soul  among  them  who 
had not received many wounds.

26 And  now,  their  a preservation 
was astonishing to our whole army, 
yea,  that  they  should  be  spared 
while there was a thousand of our 
brethren who were slain. And we 
do justly ascribe it to the miracu-
lous b power of God, because of their 
exceeding c faith in that which they 
had  been  taught  to  believe—that 
there was a just God, and whoso-
ever did not doubt, that they should 
be  preserved  by  his  marvelous  
power.

27 Now this was the a faith of these 
of  whom  I  have  spoken;  they  are 
young, and their minds are b firm, 
and they do put their trust in God 
continually.

28 And now it came to pass that 
after we had thus taken care of our 
wounded men, and had buried our 
dead and also the dead of the La-
manites, who were many, behold, 
we  did  inquire  of  Gid  concern-
ing the a prisoners whom they had 
started to go down to the land of 
Zarahemla with.

29 Now Gid was the chief captain 
over the band who was appointed 
to guard them down to the land.

30 And now, these are the words 
which  Gid  said  unto  me:  Behold, 
we did start to go down to the land 
of  Zarahemla  with  our  prisoners. 
And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  did 
meet the spies of our armies, who

had been sent out to watch the camp 
of the Lamanites.

31 And  they  cried  unto  us,  say-
ing—Behold, the armies of the La-
manites are marching towards the 
city  of  Cumeni;  and  behold,  they 
will fall upon them, yea, and will 
destroy our people.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  our 
prisoners did hear their cries, which  
caused them to take courage; and 
they did rise up in rebellion against 
us.

33 And it came to pass because of 
their  rebellion  we  did  cause  that 
our swords should come upon them. 
And it came to pass that they did 
in a body run upon our swords, in 
the which, the greater number of 
them were slain; and the remainder  
of  them  broke  through  and  fled 
from us.

34 And behold, when they had fled 
and we could not overtake them, we 
took our march with speed towards 
the city Cumeni; and behold, we did 
arrive in time that we might assist 
our brethren in preserving the city.
35 And behold, we are again de-
livered out of the hands of our en-
emies. And blessed is the name of 
our  God;  for  behold,  it  is  he  that 
has delivered us; yea, that has done 
this great thing for us.

36 Now it came to pass that when 
I, Helaman, had heard these words 
of Gid, I was filled with exceeding 
joy because of the goodness of God 
in  preserving  us,  that  we  might 
not all perish; yea, and I trust that 
the  souls  of  them  who  have  been 
slain have a entered into the rest of 
their God.

CHAPTER 58
Helaman, Gid, and Teomner take the 
city  of  Manti  by  a  stratagem—The 
Lamanites withdraw—The sons of the 
people of Ammon are preserved as they 
stand fast in defense of their liberty and 
faith. About 63–62 b.c.

And  behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that our next object was to obtain 
the city of Manti; but behold, there 
was no way that we could lead them 
out of the city by our small bands. 
For behold, they remembered that 
which we had hitherto done; there-
fore we could not a decoy them away 
from their strongholds.

2 And  they  were  so  much  more 
numerous than was our army that 
we  durst  not  go  forth  and  attack 
them in their strongholds.

3 Yea,  and  it  became  expedient 
that we should employ our men to 
the maintaining those parts of the 
land which we had regained of our 
possessions; therefore it became ex-
pedient that we should wait, that we 
might receive more strength from 
the land of Zarahemla and also a 
new supply of provisions.

4 And it came to pass that I thus 
did send an embassy to the governor 
of our land, to acquaint him con-
cerning the affairs of our people. 
And it came to pass that we did wait 
to receive provisions and strength 
from the land of Zarahemla.

5 But behold, this did profit us but 
little; for the Lamanites were also 
receiving great strength from day 
to day, and also many provisions; 
and  thus  were  our  circumstances 
at this period of time.

6 And the Lamanites were sallying 
forth against us from time to time, 
resolving by stratagem to destroy us; 
nevertheless we could not come to 
battle with them, because of their 
a retreats and their strongholds.

7 And it came to pass that we did 
wait in these difficult circumstances 
for the space of many months, even 
until we were about to a perish for 
the want of food.

8 But it came to pass that we did 
receive food, which was guarded to 
us by an army of two thousand men 
to our assistance; and this is all the 
assistance which we did receive, to 
defend ourselves and our country

from falling into the hands of our 
enemies,  yea,  to  contend  with  an 
enemy which was innumerable.

9 And now the cause of these our 
embarrassments, or the cause why 
they did not send more strength unto 
us, we knew not; therefore we were 
grieved and also filled with fear, lest  
by any means the judgments of God 
should come upon our land, to our 
overthrow and utter destruction.

10 Therefore we did pour out our 
souls in prayer to God, that he would 
strengthen us and deliver us out of 
the hands of our enemies, yea, and 
also give us strength that we might 
retain our cities, and our lands, and 
our possessions, for the support of 
our people.

11 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that  
the Lord our God did visit us with 
assurances  that  he  would  deliver 
us; yea, insomuch that he did speak 
peace  to  our  souls,  and  did  grant  
unto us great faith, and did cause 
us  that  we  should  hope  for  our  
a deliverance in him.

12 And we did take courage with 
our small force which we had re-
ceived, and were fixed with a deter-
mination to conquer our enemies, 
and to a maintain our lands, and our  
possessions,  and  our  wives,  and 
our children, and the cause of our 
b liberty.

13 And thus we did go forth with 
all  our  might  against  the  Laman-
ites, who were in the city of Manti; 
and we did pitch our tents by the 
wilderness  side,  which  was  near 
to the city.

14 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow, that when the Lamanites 
saw that we were in the borders by 
the wilderness which was near the 
city, that they sent out their spies 
round about us that they might dis-
cover the number and the strength 
of our army.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they saw that we were not strong, 

according  to  our  numbers,  and 
fearing  that  we  should  cut  them 
off from their support except they 
should come out to battle against 
us and kill us, and also supposing 
that  they  could  easily  destroy  us 
with their numerous hosts, therefore 
they began to make preparations to 
come out against us to battle.

16 And  when  we  saw  that  they 
were making preparations to come 
out  against  us,  behold,  I  caused 
that Gid, with a small number of 
men, should a secrete himself in the 
wilderness, and also that Teomner 
and a small number of men should 
secrete  themselves  also  in  the  
wilderness.

17 Now Gid and his men were on 
the right and the others on the left; 
and when they had thus secreted 
themselves,  behold,  I  remained, 
with the remainder of my army, in 
that same place where we had first 
pitched our tents against the time 
that  the  Lamanites  should  come 
out to battle.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come out with their 
numerous  army  against  us.  And 
when they had come and were about 
to  fall  upon  us  with  the  sword,  I 
caused  that  my  men,  those  who 
were with me, should retreat into 
the wilderness.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did follow after us with 
great speed, for they were exceed-
ingly desirous to overtake us that 
they might slay us; therefore they did 
follow us into the wilderness; and we 
did pass by in the midst of Gid and 
Teomner, insomuch that they were  
not discovered by the Lamanites.

20 And it came to pass that when 
the  Lamanites  had  passed  by,  or 
when the army had passed by, Gid 
and Teomner did rise up from their 
secret  places,  and  did  cut  off  the 
spies  of  the  Lamanites  that  they 
should not return to the city.

21 And it came to pass that when 
they had cut them off, they ran to 
the city and fell upon the guards 
who were left to guard the city, in-
somuch that they did destroy them 
and did take possession of the city.
22 Now this was done because the 
Lamanites  did  suffer  their  whole 
army, save a few guards only, to be 
led away into the wilderness.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Gid 
and  Teomner  by  this  means  had 
obtained possession of their strong-
holds. And it came to pass that we 
took our course, after having trav-
eled much in the wilderness towards 
the land of Zarahemla.

24 And when the Lamanites saw 
that  they  were  marching  towards 
the land of Zarahemla, they were 
exceedingly afraid, lest there was 
a plan laid to lead them on to de-
struction; therefore they began to 
retreat into the wilderness again, 
yea,  even  back  by  the  same  way 
which they had come.

25 And behold, it was night and 
they did pitch their tents, for the 
chief  a captains  of  the  Lamanites 
had  supposed  that  the  Nephites 
were weary because of their march; 
and supposing that they had driven 
their  whole  army  therefore  they 
took  no  thought  concerning  the 
city of Manti.

26 Now it came to pass that when 
it was night, I caused that my men 
should  not  sleep,  but  that  they 
should march forward by another 
way towards the land of Manti.

27 And because of this our march 
in  the  night-time,  behold,  on  the 
morrow we were beyond the Laman-
ites,  insomuch  that  we  did  arrive 
before them at the city of Manti.

28 And thus it came to pass, that 
by this stratagem we did take pos-
session of the city of Manti without 
the shedding of blood.

29 And it came to pass that when 
the  armies  of  the  Lamanites  did  

arrive near the city, and saw that 
we  were  prepared  to  meet  them, 
they were astonished exceedingly 
and  struck  with  great  fear,  inso-
much that they did  a flee into the  
wilderness.

30 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that 
the armies of the Lamanites did flee 
out of all this quarter of the land. 
But behold, they have carried with 
them  many  women  and  children 
out of the land.

31 And  a those  cities  which  had 
been taken by the Lamanites, all of 
them are at this period of time in 
our possession; and our fathers and 
our women and our children are re-
turning to their homes, all save it be  
those who have been taken prisoners 
and carried off by the Lamanites.

32 But behold, our armies are small 
to maintain so great a number of 
cities and so great possessions.

33 But behold, we a trust in our God 
who has given us victory over those 
lands, insomuch that we have ob-
tained those cities and those lands, 
which were our own.

34 Now we do not know the a cause 
that the government does not grant 
us more strength; neither do those 
men  who  came  up  unto  us  know 
why we have not received greater 
strength.

35 Behold,  we  do  not  know  but 
what a ye are unsuccessful, and ye 
have  drawn  away  the  forces  into 
that quarter of the land; if so, we 
do not desire to murmur.

36 And if it is not so, behold, we 
fear that there is some a faction in 
the government, that they do not 
send  more  men  to  our  assistance; 
for  we  know  that  they  are  more 
numerous  than  that  which  they  
have sent.

37 But, behold, it mattereth not—
we trust God will a deliver us, not-
withstanding the weakness of our 
armies, yea, and deliver us out of 
the hands of our enemies.

38 Behold, this is the twenty and 
ninth year, in the latter end, and we 
are in the possession of our lands; 
and the Lamanites have fled to the 
land of Nephi.

39 And  those  sons  of  the  people  
of  Ammon,  of  whom  I  have  so 
highly spoken, are with me in the 
city of Manti; and the Lord has sup-
ported  them,  yea,  and  kept  them 
from  falling  by  the  sword,  inso-
much that even  a one soul has not  
been slain.

40 But behold, they have received 
many  wounds;  nevertheless  they 
a stand fast in that b liberty where-
with God has made them free; and 
they are strict to remember the Lord 
their God from day to day; yea, they 
do observe to keep his statutes, and 
his judgments, and his command-
ments continually; and their faith 
is strong in the prophecies concern-
ing that which is to come.

41 And now, my beloved brother, 
Moroni, may the Lord our God, who 
has redeemed us and made us free, 
keep  you  continually  in  his  pres-
ence;  yea,  and  may  he  favor  this 
people, even that ye may have suc-
cess in obtaining the possession of 
all that which the Lamanites have 
taken from us, which was for our 
support. And now, behold, I close 
mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son  
of Alma.

CHAPTER 59

Moroni asks Pahoran to strengthen the 
forces  of  Helaman—The  Lamanites 
take  the  city  of  Nephihah—Moroni 
is  angry  with  the  government.  About  
62 b.c.
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, after Moroni 
had  received  and  had  read  Hela-
man’s a epistle, he was exceedingly 
rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, 

the exceeding success which Hela-
man had had, in obtaining  b those 
lands which were lost.

2 Yea, and he did make it known 
unto all his people, in all the land 
round about in that part where he 
was, that they might rejoice also.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
immediately  sent  a an  epistle  to 
b Pahoran, desiring that he should 
cause men to be gathered together 
to  strengthen  Helaman,  or  the 
armies of Helaman, insomuch that  
he  might  with  ease  maintain  
that part of the land which he had 
been so miraculously prospered in  
regaining.

4 And it came to pass when Mo-
roni  had  sent  this  epistle  to  the 
land of Zarahemla, he began again 
to lay a plan that he might obtain 
the remainder of those possessions 
and cities which the Lamanites had 
taken from them.

5 And it came to pass that while 
Moroni was thus making prepara-
tions  to  go  against  the  Lamanites 
to  battle,  behold,  the  people  of 
a Nephihah,  who  were  gathered 
together  from  the  city  of  Moroni 
and  the  city  of  Lehi  and  the  city 
of Morianton, were attacked by the 
Lamanites.

6 Yea,  even  those  who  had  been 
a compelled  to  flee  from  the  land 
of Manti, and from the land round 
about, had come over and joined the 
Lamanites in this part of the land.
7 And thus being exceedingly nu-
merous, yea, and receiving strength 
from day to day, by the command of 
Ammoron they came forth against 
the people of Nephihah, and they 
did begin to slay them with an ex-
ceedingly great slaughter.

8 And  their  armies  were  so  nu-
merous that the remainder of the 
people of  a Nephihah were b obliged 
to flee before them; and they came 
even and joined the army of Moroni.

9 And now as Moroni had supposed 
that there  a should be men sent to 
the city of Nephihah, to the assis-
tance of the people to maintain that 
city, and knowing that it was easier 
to keep the city from falling into 
the hands of the Lamanites than to 
retake it from them, he supposed 
that  they  would  easily  maintain  
that city.

10 Therefore  he  retained  all  his 
force to maintain those places which 
he had recovered.

11 And  now,  when  Moroni  saw 
that the city of Nephihah was a lost 
he was exceedingly sorrowful, and 
began to doubt, because of the wick-
edness of the people, whether they 
should  not  fall  into  the  hands  of 
their brethren.

12 Now this was the case with all 
his  chief  captains.  They  doubted 
and marveled also because of the 
wickedness of the people, and this 
because  of  the  success  of  the  La-
manites over them.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni  was  angry  with  the  govern-
ment, because of their a indifference 
concerning  the  freedom  of  their  
country.

CHAPTER 60
Moroni  complains  to  Pahoran  of  the 
government’s  neglect  of  the  armies—
The  Lord  suffers  the  righteous  to  be 
slain—The Nephites must use all of their 
power and means to deliver themselves 
from  their  enemies—Moroni  threat-
ens  to  fight  against  the  government 
unless help is supplied to his armies.  
About 62 b.c.
And it came to pass that he wrote 
a again to the governor of the land, 
who  was  Pahoran,  and  these  are 
the words which he wrote, saying: 
Behold,  I  direct  mine  epistle  to 
Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, 
who is the chief judge and the b gov-
ernor over the land, and also to all 

those who have been chosen by this 
people to govern and manage the 
affairs of this war.

2 For behold, I have somewhat to 
say unto them by the way of a con-
demnation; for behold, ye yourselves 
know that ye have been appointed 
to  gather  together  men,  and  arm 
them with swords, and with cime-
ters, and all manner of weapons of 
war of every kind, and send forth 
against the Lamanites, in whatso-
ever  parts  they  should  come  into  
our land.

3 And now behold, I say unto you 
that myself, and also my men, and 
also  Helaman  and  his  men,  have 
suffered exceedingly great a suffer-
ings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and 
fatigue,  and  all  manner  of  afflic-
tions of every kind.

4 But behold, were this all we had 
suffered we would not murmur nor 
complain.

5 But behold, great has been the 
slaughter  among  our  people;  yea, 
thousands have fallen by the sword, 
while it might have otherwise been 
if ye had rendered unto our armies 
sufficient strength and succor for 
them. Yea, great has been your ne-
glect towards us.

6 And now behold, we desire to 
know the cause of this exceedingly 
great  neglect;  yea,  we  desire  to 
know  the  cause  of  your  thought-
less state.

7 Can you think to sit upon your 
thrones  in  a  state  of  thoughtless 
a stupor,  while  your  enemies  are 
spreading the work of death around 
you? Yea, while they are murdering 
thousands of your brethren—

8 Yea, even they who have looked 
up to you for protection, yea, have 
placed  you  in  a  situation  that  ye  
might  have  succored  them,  yea,  
ye  might  have  sent  armies  unto 
them, to have strengthened them, 
and have saved thousands of them 
from falling by the sword.

9 But  behold,  this  is  not  all—ye 
have withheld your provisions from 
them,  insomuch  that  many  have 
fought and bled out their lives be-
cause of their great desires which  
they had for the welfare of this peo-
ple;  yea,  and  this  they  have  done 
when they were about to a perish with 
hunger, because of your exceedingly  
great neglect towards them.

10 And  now,  my  beloved  breth-
ren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea,  
and ye ought to have stirred your-
selves more diligently for the wel-
fare and the freedom of this people; 
but behold, ye have neglected them 
insomuch that the blood of thou-
sands shall come upon your heads 
for  vengeance;  yea,  for  a known 
unto God were all their cries, and 
all their sufferings—

11 Behold, could ye suppose that 
ye could sit upon your thrones, and 
because of the exceeding goodness 
of God ye could do nothing and he 
would  deliver  you?  Behold,  if  ye 
have  supposed  this  ye  have  sup-
posed in vain.

12 Do ye a suppose that, because so 
many of your brethren have been 
killed it is because of their wicked-
ness? I say unto you, if ye have sup-
posed this ye have supposed in vain; 
for I say unto you, there are many 
who have fallen by the sword; and 
behold it is to your condemnation;
13 For  the  Lord  suffereth  the 
a righteous to be slain that his jus-
tice and b judgment may come upon 
the wicked; therefore ye need not 
suppose that the righteous are lost 
because they are slain; but behold, 
they do enter into the rest of the 
Lord their God.

14 And  now  behold,  I  say  unto  
you,  I  fear  exceedingly  that  the  
judgments of God will come upon 
this  people,  because  of  their  ex-
ceeding a slothfulness, yea, even the 

slothfulness of our government, and 
their exceedingly great neglect to-
wards their brethren, yea, towards 
those who have been slain.

15 For  were  it  not  for  the  wick-
edness which first commenced at 
our head, we a could have withstood 
our enemies that they could have 
gained no power over us.

16 Yea, had it not been for the war 
which broke out a among ourselves; 
yea, were it not for these b king-men, 
who  caused  so  much  bloodshed 
among ourselves; yea, at the time we 
were contending among ourselves, 
if we had united our strength as we 
hitherto have done; yea, had it not 
been for the desire of power and au-
thority which those king-men had 
over us; had they been true to the 
cause of our freedom, and united 
with us, and gone forth against our 
enemies, instead of taking up their 
swords  against  us,  which  was  the 
cause of so much bloodshed among 
ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth 
against them in the strength of the 
Lord, we should have dispersed our 
enemies,  for  it  would  have  been 
done,  according  to  the  c fulfilling 
of his word.

17 But  behold,  now  the  Laman-
ites  are  coming  upon  us,  taking 
a possession of our lands, and they 
are murdering our people with the 
sword,  yea,  our  women  and  our 
children,  and  also  carrying  them 
away  captive,  causing  them  that 
they  should  suffer  all  manner  of 
afflictions, and this because of the 
great wickedness of those who are 
seeking  for  power  and  authority, 
yea, even those king-men.

18 But why should I say much con-
cerning this matter? For we know 
not but what ye yourselves are seek-
ing for authority. We know not but 
what  ye  are  also  a traitors  to  your  
country.

19 Or is it that ye have neglected 
us because ye are in the heart of our 
country and ye are a surrounded by 
security, that ye do not cause food 
to be sent unto us, and also men to 
strengthen our armies?

20 Have  ye  forgotten  the  com-
mandments of the Lord your God? 
Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity 
of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the 
many times we have been delivered 
out of the hands of our enemies?

21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord 
a will  still  deliver  us,  while  we  sit 
upon our thrones and do not make 
use  of  the  means  which  the  Lord 
has provided for us?

22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while 
ye are surrounded with thousands 
of those, yea, and tens of thousands, 
who do also sit in idleness, while 
there  are  thousands  round  about 
in the borders of the land who are 
falling by the sword, yea, wounded 
and bleeding?

23 Do  ye  suppose  that  God  will  
look upon you as guiltless while ye 
sit  still  and  behold  these  things? 
Behold  I  say  unto  you,  Nay.  Now 
I would that ye should remember 
that God has said that the a inward 
vessel  shall  be  b cleansed  first, 
and then shall the outer vessel be 
cleansed also.

24 And now, except ye do repent 
of  that  which  ye  have  done,  and 
begin to be up and doing, and send 
forth food and men unto us, and also 
unto Helaman, that he may support 
those  parts  of  our  country  which 
he has regained, and that we may 
also recover the remainder of our 
possessions in these parts, behold it 
will be expedient that we contend 
no more with the Lamanites until 
we have first cleansed our inward 
vessel, yea, even the great head of 
our government.

25 And except ye grant mine epis-
tle,  and  come  out  and  show  unto 
me a true  a spirit of freedom, and 

strive to strengthen and fortify our 
armies, and grant unto them food 
for their support, behold I will leave 
a part of my freemen to maintain 
this  part  of  our  land,  and  I  will 
leave the strength and the blessings 
of God upon them, that none other 
power can operate against them—
26 And  this  because  of  their  ex-
ceeding  faith,  and  their  patience 
in their a tribulations—

27 And I will come unto you, and 
if  there  be  any  among  you  that 
has  a  desire  for  freedom,  yea,  if 
there be even a spark of freedom 
remaining, behold I will stir up in-
surrections among you, even until 
those  who  have  desires  to  usurp 
power and authority shall become  
extinct.

28 Yea, behold I do not fear your 
power  nor  your  authority,  but  it 
is my  a God whom I fear; and it is 
according  to  his  commandments 
that I do take my sword to defend 
the cause of my country, and it is 
because  of  your  iniquity  that  we 
have suffered so much loss.

29 Behold it is time, yea, the time 
is now at hand, that except ye do 
bestir yourselves in the defence of 
your country and your little ones, 
the a sword of justice doth hang over 
you; yea, and it shall fall upon you 
and  visit  you  even  to  your  utter 
destruction.

30 Behold,  I  wait  for  assistance 
from  you;  and,  except  ye  do  ad-
minister unto our relief, behold, I 
come unto you, even in the land of 
Zarahemla, and smite you with the 
sword, insomuch that ye can have no 
more power to impede the progress 
of this people in the cause of our  
freedom.

31 For behold, the Lord will not 
suffer  that  ye  shall  live  and  wax 
strong in your iniquities to destroy 
his righteous people.

out in judgment against the Laman-
ites, when it is the a tradition of their 
fathers that has caused their hatred, 
yea, and it has been redoubled by 
those who have dissented from us, 
while your iniquity is for the cause 
of your love of glory and the vain 
things of the world?

33 Ye know that ye do transgress 
the laws of God, and ye do know that 
ye do trample them under your feet. 
Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If 
those whom ye have appointed your 
governors do not repent of their sins 
and  a iniquities, ye shall  b go up to  
battle against them.

34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am 
constrained, according to the cov-
enant which I have made to keep the 
commandments of my God; there-
fore I would that ye should adhere 
to the word of God, and send speed-
ily unto me of your provisions and  
of your men, and also to Helaman.
35 And behold, if ye will not do this 
I come unto you speedily; for behold, 
God will not suffer that we should 
perish  with  hunger;  therefore  he 
will  give  unto  us  of  your  food,  
even if it must be by the sword. Now 
see that ye fulfil the word of God.
36 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief 
captain. I a seek not for power, but to 
pull it down. I b seek not for honor 
of the world, but for the glory of 
my God, and the freedom and wel-
fare of my country. And thus I close 
mine epistle.

CHAPTER 61
Pahoran tells Moroni of the insurrection 
and rebellion against the government—
The king-men take Zarahemla and are 
in league with the Lamanites—Pahoran 
asks for military aid against the rebels. 
About 62 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that 

soon  after  Moroni  had  sent  his 
epistle unto the chief governor, he 
received an epistle from a Pahoran, 
the chief governor. And these are 
the words which he received:

2 I,  Pahoran,  who  am  the  chief 
governor of this land, do send these 
words unto Moroni, the chief cap-
tain  over  the  army.  Behold,  I  say 
unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy 
in  your  great  a afflictions,  yea,  it 
grieves my soul.

3 But behold, there are those who 
do joy in your afflictions, yea, in-
somuch that they have risen up in 
a rebellion against me, and also those 
of  my  people  who  are  b freemen, 
yea, and those who have risen up 
are exceedingly numerous.

4 And it is those who have sought 
to  take  away  the  judgment-seat 
from me that have been the cause 
of this great iniquity; for they have 
used great a flattery, and they have 
b led away the hearts of many peo-
ple,  which  will  be  the  cause  of 
sore affliction among us; they have 
withheld our provisions, and have 
daunted  our  c freemen  that  they 
have not come unto you.

5 And  behold,  they  have  driven 
me  out  before  them,  and  I  have 
fled to the land of Gideon, with as 
many men as it were possible that 
I could get.

6 And behold, I have sent a procla-
mation throughout this part of the 
land; and behold, they are  a flock-
ing  to  us  b daily,  to  their  arms,  in 
the  defence  of  their  country  and 
their c freedom, and to avenge our  
d wrongs.

7 And they have come unto us, in-
somuch that those who have risen 
up in rebellion against us are set at 
defiance, yea, insomuch that they 
do fear us and durst not come out 
against us to battle.

8 They have a got possession of the 
land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they 
have appointed a b king over them, 
and he hath written unto the king 
of the Lamanites, in the which he 
hath joined an alliance with him; in 
the which alliance he hath agreed 
to maintain the city of Zarahemla, 
which maintenance he supposeth 
will enable the Lamanites to con-
quer  the  remainder  of  the  land, 
and  he  shall  be  placed  king  over 
this people when they shall be con-
quered c under the Lamanites.

9 And  now,  in  your  epistle  you 
have a censured me, but it mattereth 
not; I am not angry, but do rejoice 
in  the  greatness  of  your  heart.  I, 
Pahoran,  do  not  b seek  for  power, 
save only to retain my judgment-
seat that I may preserve the rights 
and the liberty of my people. My 
soul standeth fast in that liberty in 
the which God hath made us c free.
10 And now, behold, we will resist 
wickedness  even  unto  bloodshed. 
We  would  a not  shed  the  blood  of 
the  Lamanites  if  they  would  stay 
in their own land.

11 We would not shed the blood 
of our brethren if they would not 
rise  up  in  rebellion  and  take  the 
sword against us.

12 We  would  subject  ourselves 
to the a yoke of bondage if it were 
requisite with the justice of God, or 
if he should command us so to do.
13 But  behold  he  doth  not  com-
mand us that we shall subject our-
selves to our enemies, but that we 
should put our  a trust in him, and 
he will deliver us.

14 Therefore, my beloved brother, 
Moroni, let us resist evil, and what-
soever  evil  we  cannot  resist  with 
our a words, yea, such as rebellions 

and dissensions, let us b resist them 
with our swords, that we may retain 
our freedom, that we may rejoice in 
the great privilege of our church, 
and in the cause of our Redeemer 
and our God.

15 Therefore, come unto me speed-
ily  with  a  few  of  your  men,  and 
leave the remainder in the charge 
of  Lehi  and  Teancum;  give  unto 
them power to conduct the a war in 
that part of the land, according to 
the b Spirit of God, which is also the 
c spirit of freedom which is in them.
16 Behold I have sent a few provi-
sions unto them, that they may not 
perish until ye can come unto me.
17 Gather  together  whatsoever 
force ye can upon your march hither, 
and  we  will  go  speedily  against 
those  dissenters,  in  the  strength 
of our God according to the faith  
which is in us.

18 And we will a take possession of 
the city of Zarahemla, that we may 
obtain more food to send forth unto 
Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go 
forth against them in the strength 
of the Lord, and we will put an end 
to this great iniquity.

19 And  now,  Moroni,  I  do  joy  in 
receiving  your  epistle,  for  I  was 
somewhat worried concerning what 
we should do, whether it should be 
just in us to go against our brethren.
20 But ye have said, except they 
repent the Lord a hath commanded 
you that ye should go against them.
21 See that ye a strengthen Lehi and 
Teancum in the Lord; tell them to 
fear not, for God will deliver them, 
yea, and also all those who b stand 
fast in that liberty wherewith God 
hath  made  them  free.  And  now  I 
close  mine  epistle  to  my  beloved 
brother, Moroni.

ALMA 62  : 1–13

CHAPTER 62

Moroni marches to the aid of Pahoran 
in the land of Gideon—The king-men 
who refuse to defend their country are 
put to death—Pahoran and Moroni re-
take Nephihah—Many Lamanites join 
the people of Ammon—Teancum slays 
Ammoron  and  is  in  turn  slain—The 
Lamanites  are  driven  from  the  land, 
and  peace  is  established—Helaman 
returns to the ministry and builds up 
the Church. About 62–57 b.c.
And now it came to pass that when 
Moroni  had  received  this  epistle 
his heart did take courage, and was  
filled with exceedingly great joy be-
cause of the faithfulness of Pahoran,  
that he was not also a a traitor to the 
freedom and cause of his country.
2 But he did also mourn exceed-
ingly because of the iniquity of those  
who had driven Pahoran from the 
judgment-seat, yea, in fine because 
of those who had rebelled against 
their country and also their God.

3 And it came to pass that Moroni 
took  a  small  number  of  men,  ac-
cording  to  the  desire  of  Pahoran, 
and gave Lehi and Teancum com-
mand  over  the  remainder  of  his 
army, and took his march towards 
the land of Gideon.

4 And he did raise the a standard 
of b liberty in whatsoever place he 
did enter, and gained whatsoever 
force he could in all his march to-
wards the land of Gideon.

5 And it came to pass that thou-
sands did a flock unto his standard, 
and did take up their swords in the 
defence of their freedom, that they 
might not come into bondage.

6 And  thus,  when  Moroni  had  
gathered together whatsoever men 
he could in all his march, he came  
to the land of Gideon; and uniting 
his  forces  with  those  of  Pahoran 
they  became  exceedingly  strong, 
even  stronger  than  the  men  of  

Pachus, who was the a king of those 
dissenters  who  had  driven  the  
b freemen out of the land of Zara-
hemla  and  had  taken  possession 
of the land.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni and Pahoran went down with 
their armies into the land of Zara-
hemla, and went forth against the 
city, and did meet the men of Pa-
chus, insomuch that they did come  
to battle.

8 And  behold,  Pachus  was  slain 
and his men were taken prisoners, 
and  Pahoran  was  restored  to  his 
judgment-seat.

9 And the men of Pachus received 
their trial, according to the law, and 
also those king-men who had been 
taken  and  a cast  into  prison;  and 
they  were  b executed  according  to 
the law; yea, those men of Pachus 
and  those  c king-men,  whosoever 
would not take up arms in the de-
fence of their country, but would 
fight against it, were put to death.
10 And thus it became expedient 
that this law should be strictly ob-
served for the safety of their coun-
try; yea, and whosoever was found 
denying their freedom was speed-
ily a executed according to the law.
11 And  thus  ended  the  thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the  people  of  Nephi;  Moroni  and 
Pahoran having restored peace to 
the land of Zarahemla, among their 
own people, having a inflicted death 
upon all those who were not true 
to the cause of freedom.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  
commencement  of  the  thirty  and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, Moroni 
immediately caused that provisions 
should  be  sent,  and  also  an  army 
of six thousand men should be sent 
unto Helaman, to assist him in pre-
serving that part of the land.

13 And  he  also  caused  that  an

army of six thousand men, with a 
sufficient quantity of food, should 
be sent to the armies of Lehi and 
Teancum. And it came to pass that 
this  was  done  to  fortify  the  land 
against the Lamanites.

14 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and Pahoran, leaving a large body of 
men in the land of Zarahemla, took 
their  march  with  a  large  body  of 
men towards the land of Nephihah, 
being determined to a overthrow the 
Lamanites in that city.

15 And it came to pass that as they 
were  marching  towards  the  land, 
they  took  a  large  body  of  men  of 
the  Lamanites,  and  slew  many  of 
them, and took their provisions and 
their weapons of war.

16 And it came to pass after they 
had taken them, they caused them 
to enter into a a covenant that they 
would no more take up their weap-
ons of war against the Nephites.

17 And  when  they  had  entered 
into this covenant they sent them to 
a dwell with the people of Ammon, 
and they were in number about four 
thousand who had not been slain.
18 And it came to pass that when 
they had sent them away they pur-
sued their march towards the land 
of a Nephihah. And it came to pass 
that when they had come to the city 
of Nephihah, they did pitch their 
tents  in  the  plains  of  Nephihah, 
which is near the city of Nephihah.
19 Now Moroni was desirous that 
the  Lamanites  should  come  out 
to  battle  against  them,  upon  the 
plains; but the Lamanites, knowing 
of their exceedingly great courage, 
and  beholding  the  greatness  of 
their numbers, therefore they durst 
not come out against them; there-
fore they did not come to battle in  
that day.

20 And  when  the  night  came,  
Moroni went forth in the darkness 
of  the  night,  and  came  upon  the 
top of the wall to spy out in what 

part of the city the Lamanites did 
camp with their army.

21 And it came to pass that they 
were on the east, by the entrance; 
and they were all asleep. And now 
Moroni returned to his army, and 
caused  that  they  should  prepare 
in haste strong cords and ladders, 
to be let down from the top of the 
a wall into the inner part of the wall.
22 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused that his men should march 
forth and come upon the top of the 
wall, and let a themselves down into 
that part of the city, yea, even on 
the west, where the Lamanites did 
not camp with their armies.

23 And it came to pass that they 
were all let down into the city by 
night, by the means of their strong 
cords and their ladders; thus when 
the  morning  came  they  were  all 
within the walls of the city.

24 And now, when the Lamanites 
awoke and saw that the armies of 
Moroni were within the walls, they 
were  affrighted  exceedingly,  in-
somuch  that  they  did  flee  out  by 
the pass.

25 And  now  when  Moroni  saw 
that they were fleeing before him, 
he did cause that his men should 
march forth against them, and slew 
many, and surrounded many oth-
ers, and took them prisoners; and 
the remainder of them fled into the 
land of Moroni, which was in the 
borders by the seashore.

26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran 
obtained the a possession of the city 
of Nephihah without the loss of one 
soul; and there were many of the 
Lamanites who were slain.

27 Now it came to pass that many 
of the Lamanites that were prisoners 
were desirous to a join the people of 
Ammon and become a free people.
28 And it came to pass that as many 
as were desirous, unto them it was 
granted according to their desires.
29 Therefore, all the prisoners of

the Lamanites did join the people 
of Ammon, and did begin to labor 
exceedingly, tilling the ground, rais-
ing all manner of grain, and flocks 
and herds of every kind; and thus 
were the Nephites relieved from a 
great  burden;  yea,  insomuch  that 
they  were  relieved  from  all  the 
prisoners of the Lamanites.

30 Now it came to pass that Moroni, 
after he had obtained possession of 
the city of Nephihah, having taken 
many prisoners, which did reduce 
the armies of the Lamanites exceed-
ingly, and having regained many of 
the Nephites who had been taken 
prisoners, which did strengthen the  
army of Moroni exceedingly; there-
fore Moroni went forth from the land  
of Nephihah to the land of a Lehi.

31 And it came to pass that when 
the Lamanites saw that Moroni was 
coming  against  them,  they  were 
again  frightened  and  fled  before 
the army of Moroni.

32 And it came to pass that a Mo-
roni and his army did pursue them 
from  city  to  city,  until  they  were 
met by Lehi and Teancum; and the 
Lamanites fled from Lehi and Tean-
cum, even down upon the borders 
by the seashore, until they came to 
the land of Moroni.

33 And the armies of the Laman-
ites were all gathered together, in-
somuch that they were all in one 
body  in  the  land  of  Moroni.  Now 
Ammoron, the king of the Laman-
ites, was also with them.

34 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and Lehi and Teancum did encamp 
with their armies round about in 
the borders of the land of Moroni, 
insomuch that the Lamanites were 
encircled about in the borders by 
the  wilderness  on  the  south,  and  
in the borders by the wilderness on  
the east.

35 And thus they did encamp for 
the  night.  For  behold,  the  Neph-
ites  and  the  Lamanites  also  were 

weary because of the greatness of 
the march; therefore they did not 
resolve upon any stratagem in the 
night-time, save it were Teancum; 
for he was exceedingly angry with 
Ammoron, insomuch that he con-
sidered that Ammoron, and Amal-
ickiah  his  brother,  had  been  the 
a cause of this great and lasting war 
between them and the Lamanites, 
which had been the cause of so much 
war  and  bloodshed,  yea,  and  so  
much famine.

36 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum in his anger did go forth into 
the camp of the Lamanites, and did 
let himself down over the walls of 
the city. And he went forth with a 
cord, from place to place, insomuch 
that he did find the king; and he 
did  a cast  a  javelin  at  him,  which 
did pierce him near the heart. But 
behold,  the  king  did  awaken  his 
servants before he died, insomuch 
that they did pursue Teancum, and 
slew him.

37 Now it came to pass that when 
Lehi and Moroni knew that Tean-
cum was dead they were exceedingly  
sorrowful; for behold, he had been 
a  man  who  had  a fought  valiantly 
for his country, yea, a true friend 
to liberty; and he had suffered very 
many exceedingly sore afflictions. 
But behold, he was dead, and had 
gone the way of all the earth.

38 Now it came to pass that Mo-
roni marched forth on the morrow, 
and came upon the Lamanites, inso-
much that they did slay them with 
a great slaughter; and they did drive 
them out of the land; and they did 
flee, even that they did not return 
at that time against the Nephites.

39 And thus ended the thirty and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi; and thus 
they had had wars, and bloodsheds, 
and famine, and affliction, for the 
space of many years.

40 And there had been murders,

and  contentions,  and  dissensions,  
and all manner of iniquity among 
the people of Nephi; nevertheless 
for the a righteous’ sake, yea, because 
of the prayers of the righteous, they 
were spared.

41 But behold, because of the ex-
ceedingly great length of the war 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites  many  had  become  hard-
ened,  because  of  the  exceedingly 
great length of the war; and many 
were softened because of their a af-
flictions,  insomuch  that  they  did 
humble themselves before God, even 
in the depth of humility.

42 And it came to pass that after 
Moroni had fortified those parts of 
the land which were most exposed 
to the Lamanites, until they were 
sufficiently strong, he returned to 
the city of Zarahemla; and also He-
laman returned to the place of his 
inheritance;  and  there  was  once 
more peace established among the 
people of Nephi.

43 And  Moroni  yielded  up  the 
a command  of  his  armies  into  the 
hands of his son, whose name was 
b Moronihah; and he retired to his 
own house that he might spend the 
remainder of his days in peace.

44 And Pahoran did return to his 
judgment-seat;  and  Helaman  did 
take upon him again to preach unto 
the  people  the  word  of  God;  for 
because of so many wars and con-
tentions it had become expedient 
that a a regulation should be made 
again in the church.

45 Therefore,  Helaman  and  his 
brethren  went  forth,  and  did  de-
clare the word of God with much 
power unto the a convincing of many 
people of their wickedness, which 
did cause them to repent of their 
sins  and  to  be  baptized  unto  the 
Lord their God.

46 And it came to pass that they 
did  establish  again  the  church  of 
God, throughout all the land.

47 Yea, and regulations were made 
concerning  the  law.  And  their 
a judges, and their chief judges were 
chosen.

48 And  the  people  of  Nephi  be-
gan to a prosper again in the land, 
and began to multiply and to wax 
exceedingly  strong  again  in  the 
land. And they began to grow ex-
ceedingly rich.

49 But  notwithstanding  their 
riches,  or  their  strength,  or  their 
prosperity, they were not lifted up 
in the pride of their eyes; neither 
were  they  a slow  to  remember  the 
Lord their God; but they did humble 
themselves exceedingly before him.
50 Yea,  they  did  remember  how 
great things the Lord had done for 
them, that he had a delivered them 
from death, and from bonds, and 
from prisons, and from all manner 
of  b afflictions,  and  he  had  c deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their 
enemies.

51 And  they  did  pray  unto  the 
Lord  their  God  continually,  inso-
much that the Lord did bless them, 
according to his word, so that they 
did wax strong and a prosper in the 
land.

52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  all 
these things were done. And  a He-
laman died, in the thirty and fifth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  com-
mencement of the thirty and sixth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, that a Shiblon 
took  possession  of  those  b sacred 
things  which  had  been  delivered 
unto Helaman by Alma.

2 And he was a just man, and he 
did walk uprightly before God; and 
he did observe to do good continu-
ally,  to  keep  the  commandments 
of the Lord his God; and also did 
his brother.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  a Mo-
roni died also. And thus ended the 
thirty and sixth year of the reign 
of the judges.

4 And it came to pass that in the 
thirty and seventh year of the reign 
of the judges, there was a large com-
pany of men, even to the amount 
of five thousand and four hundred 
men,  with  their  wives  and  their 
children, departed out of the land 
of Zarahemla into the land which 
was a northward.

5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, 
he  being  an  a exceedingly  curious 
man, therefore he went forth and 
built him an exceedingly large ship, 
on the borders of the land b Boun-
tiful, by the land Desolation, and 
launched it forth into the west sea, 
by the c narrow neck which led into 
the land northward.

6 And behold, there were many of 
the Nephites who did enter therein 
and did sail forth with much pro-
visions, and also many women and 
children; and they took their course 
northward.  And  thus  ended  the 
thirty and seventh year.

7 And in the thirty and eighth year, 
this  man  built  a other  ships.  And 
the first ship did also return, and 

many more people did enter into 
it; and they also took much provi-
sions, and set out again to the land  
northward.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were never heard of more. And we 
suppose that they were drowned in 
the depths of the sea. And it came 
to pass that one other ship also did 
sail forth; and whither she did go 
we know not.

9 And it came to pass that in this 
year there were many people who 
went  forth  into  the  land  a north-
ward.  And  thus  ended  the  thirty 
and eighth year.

10 And it came to pass in the thirty  
and ninth year of the reign of the 
judges,  a Shiblon  died  also,  and  
Corianton  had  gone  forth  to  the 
land northward in a ship, to carry 
forth  provisions  unto  the  people 
who had gone forth into that land.
11 Therefore it became expedient 
for a Shiblon to confer those sacred 
things, before his death, upon the 
son  of  b Helaman,  who  was  called 
c Helaman,  being  called  after  the 
name of his father.

12 Now behold, all those a engrav-
ings which were in the possession 
of Helaman were written and sent 
forth  among  the  children  of  men 
throughout  all  the  land,  save  it 
were  those  parts  which  had  been 
commanded by Alma should  b not 
go forth.

13 Nevertheless, these things were 
to  be  kept  sacred,  and  a handed 
down  from  one  generation  to  an-
other; therefore, in this year, they 
had been conferred upon Helaman, 
before the death of Shiblon.

14 And it came to pass also in this 
year that there were some dissenters

who  had  gone  forth  unto  the  La-
manites; and they were a stirred up 
again to anger against the Nephites.
15 And  also  in  this  same  year 
they came down with a numerous 
army  to  war  against  the  people  
of a Moronihah, or against the army of  
Moronihah, in the which they were 

beaten  and  driven  back  again  to 
their own lands, suffering great loss.
16 And thus ended the thirty and 
ninth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

17 And thus ended the account of 
a Alma,  and  Helaman  his  son,  and 
also Shiblon, who was his son.

CHAPTER 1
Pahoran the second becomes chief judge 
and is murdered by Kishkumen—Pacu-
meni fills the judgment seat—Corian-
tumr leads the Lamanite armies, takes 
Zarahemla, and slays Pacumeni—Mo-
ronihah defeats the Lamanites and re-
takes  Zarahemla,  and  Coriantumr  is 
slain. About 52–50 b.c.

AND now behold, it came to pass  

   in the commencement of the  
   fortieth  year  of  the  reign  of 
the judges over the people of Nephi, 
there began to be a serious difficulty 
among the people of the Nephites.
2 For behold, a Pahoran had died, 
and gone the way of all the earth; 
therefore there began to be a serious 
contention concerning who should 
have the judgment-seat among the 
brethren,  who  were  the  sons  of  
Pahoran.

3 Now these are their names who 

did contend for the judgment-seat, 
who  did  also  cause  the  people  to 
contend:  Pahoran,  Paanchi,  and 
Pacumeni.

4 Now  these  are  not  all  the  sons 
of Pahoran (for he had many), but 
these are they who did contend for 
the judgment-seat; therefore, they 
did  cause  three  a divisions  among 
the people.

5 Nevertheless,  it  came  to  pass 
that  Pahoran  was  appointed  by 
the a voice of the people to be chief 
judge and a governor over the people  
of Nephi.

6 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni,  when  he  saw  that  he  could 
not  obtain  the  judgment-seat,  he 
did  a unite  with  the  voice  of  the  
people.

7 But  behold,  Paanchi,  and  that 
part of the people that were desir-
ous that he should be their governor, 
was exceedingly wroth; therefore,

he was about to a flatter away those 
people to rise up in rebellion against 
their brethren.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  as  he  was 
about  to  do  this,  behold,  he  was 
taken, and was tried according to 
the a voice of the people, and con-
demned  unto  death;  for  he  had 
raised up in rebellion and sought to 
destroy the b liberty of the people.
9 Now  when  those  people  who 
were  desirous  that  he  should  be 
their  governor  saw  that  he  was 
condemned unto death, therefore 
they were angry, and behold, they 
sent forth one a Kishkumen, even to 
the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and 
murdered Pahoran as he sat upon 
the judgment-seat.

10 And  he  was  pursued  by  the 
servants of Pahoran; but behold, so 
speedy was the flight of Kishkumen 
that no man could overtake him.

11 And  he  went  unto  those  that 
sent him, and they all entered into 
a covenant, yea, a swearing by their 
everlasting Maker, that they would 
tell  no  man  that  Kishkumen  had 
murdered Pahoran.

12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not 
known among the people of Nephi, 
for he was in disguise at the time 
that  he  murdered  Pahoran.  And 
Kishkumen and his band, who had 
covenanted with him, did mingle 
themselves among the people, in a 
manner that they all could not be 
found; but as many as were found 
were condemned unto a death.

13 And now behold, Pacumeni was 
appointed, according to the a voice 
of the people, to be a chief judge 
and a governor over the people, to 
reign  in  the  stead  of  his  brother 
Pahoran;  and  it  was  according  to 
his right. And all this was done in 
the fortieth year of the reign of the 
judges; and it had an end.

14 And it came to pass in the forty  

and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges,  that  the  Lamanites  had 
gathered together an innumerable 
army of men, and a armed them with  
swords,  and  with  cimeters  and  
with bows, and with arrows, and with  
head-plates, and with breastplates, 
and with all manner of shields of 
every kind.

15 And they came down again that 
they might pitch battle against the 
Nephites. And they were led by a 
man whose name was a Coriantumr; 
and he was a descendant of Zara-
hemla; and he was a b dissenter from 
among the Nephites; and he was a 
large and a mighty man.

16 Therefore, the king of the La-
manites,  whose  name  was  Tubal-
oth, who was the son of a Ammoron, 
supposing that Coriantumr, being 
a mighty man, could stand against 
the Nephites, with his strength and 
also with his great b wisdom, inso-
much  that  by  sending  him  forth 
he  should  gain  power  over  the  
Nephites—

17 Therefore he did a stir them up 
to anger, and he did gather together 
his armies, and he did appoint Co-
riantumr  to  be  their  leader,  and 
did cause that they should march 
down to the land of Zarahemla to 
battle against the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that because 
of so much contention and so much 
difficulty in the government, that 
they had not kept sufficient guards 
in the land of Zarahemla; for they 
had  supposed  that  the  Lamanites 
durst  not  come  into  the  heart  of 
their lands to attack that great city 
Zarahemla.

19 But it came to pass that Corian-
tumr did march forth at the head 
of  his  numerous  host,  and  came 
upon  the  inhabitants  of  the  city, 
and  their  march  was  with  such 
exceedingly great speed that there

was  no  time  for  the  Nephites  to 
gather together their armies.

20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut 
down the watch by the entrance 
of  the  city,  and  did  march  forth 
with his whole army into the city, 
and they did slay every one who 
did  oppose  them,  insomuch  that 
they  did  take  possession  of  the 
whole city.

21 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni, who was the chief judge, did 
flee  before  Coriantumr,  even  to 
the walls of the city. And it came 
to pass that Coriantumr did smite 
him against the wall, insomuch that 
he died. And thus ended the days 
of Pacumeni.

22 And  now  when  Coriantumr 
saw  that  he  was  in  possession  of 
the city of Zarahemla, and saw that 
the Nephites had fled before them, 
and were slain, and were taken, and 
were cast into prison, and that he 
had obtained the possession of the 
strongest hold in all the land, his 
heart a took courage insomuch that 
he was about to go forth against all 
the land.

23 And  now  he  did  not  tarry  in 
the land of Zarahemla, but he did 
march forth with a large army, even 
towards the city of a Bountiful; for 
it was his determination to go forth 
and cut his way through with the 
sword,  that  he  might  obtain  the 
north parts of the land.

24 And, supposing that their great-
est strength was in the center of the 
land, therefore he did march forth, 
giving  them  no  time  to  assemble 
themselves together save it were in 
small  bodies;  and  in  this  manner 
they  did  fall  upon  them  and  cut 
them down to the earth.

25 But behold, this march of Co-
riantumr through the center of the 
land gave Moronihah great advan-
tage  over  them,  notwithstanding 
the greatness of the number of the 
Nephites who were slain.

26 For  behold,  Moronihah  had 

supposed that the Lamanites durst 
not  come  into  the  center  of  the 
land, but that they would attack the  
cities round about in the borders 
as they had hitherto done; there-
fore  Moronihah  had  caused  that 
their strong armies should main-
tain those parts round about by the  
borders.

27 But behold, the Lamanites were 
not frightened according to his de-
sire,  but  they  had  come  into  the 
center of the land, and had taken 
the capital city which was the city 
of Zarahemla, and were marching 
through the most capital parts of 
the land, slaying the people with a 
great slaughter, both men, women, 
and children, taking possession of 
many cities and of many strongholds.
28 But when Moronihah had dis-
covered this, he immediately sent 
forth Lehi with an army round about 
to  a head them before they should 
come to the land Bountiful.

29 And  thus  he  did;  and  he  did 
head them before they came to the 
land Bountiful, and gave unto them 
battle,  insomuch  that  they  began 
to  retreat  back  towards  the  land 
of Zarahemla.

30 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah did head them in their retreat, 
and did give unto them battle, in-
somuch that it became an exceed-
ingly bloody battle; yea, many were 
slain, and among the number who 
were  slain  a Coriantumr  was  also  
found.

31 And now, behold, the Lamanites  
could not retreat either way, neither 
on the north, nor on the south, nor on  
the east, nor on the west, for they 
were surrounded on every hand by 
the Nephites.

32 And  thus  had  Coriantumr 
plunged  the  Lamanites  into  the 
midst  of  the  Nephites,  insomuch 
that they were in the power of the  
Nephites, and he himself was slain, 
and the Lamanites did a yield them-
selves into the hands of the Nephites.

33 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah took possession of the city of 
Zarahemla again, and caused that 
the Lamanites who had been taken 
prisoners should depart out of the 
land in a peace.

34 And thus ended the forty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.

CHAPTER 2
Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes 
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band 
of  Kishkumen—Helaman’s  servant 
slays Kishkumen, and the Gadianton 
band flees into the wilderness. About 
50–49 b.c.
And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  forty 
and  second  year  of  the  reign  of 
the  judges,  after  Moronihah  had 
established  again  peace  between 
the  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites, 
behold there was no one to fill the 
judgment-seat; therefore there be-
gan to be a contention again among 
the people concerning who should 
fill the judgment-seat.

2 And it came to pass that a Hela-
man, who was the son of Helaman, 
was appointed to fill the judgment-
seat, by the b voice of the people.

3 But  behold,  a Kishkumen,  who 
had  murdered  Pahoran,  did  lay 
wait to destroy Helaman also; and 
he  was  upheld  by  his  band,  who 
had entered into a covenant that no 
one should know his wickedness.

4 For  there  was  one  a Gadianton, 
who was exceedingly expert in many 
words, and also in his craft, to carry 
on the secret work of murder and 
of robbery; therefore he became the  
leader of the band of Kishkumen.
5 Therefore he did a flatter them, 
and  also  Kishkumen,  that  if  they 
would place him in the judgment-
seat  he  would  grant  unto  those 
who belonged to his band that they 
should be placed in power and au-
thority  among  the  people;  there-

fore Kishkumen sought to destroy 
Helaman.

6 And it came to pass as he went 
forth  towards  the  judgment-seat 
to destroy Helaman, behold one of 
the  servants  of  Helaman,  having 
been out by night, and having ob-
tained, through disguise, a knowl-
edge  of  those  plans  which  had 
been laid by this band to destroy  
Helaman—

7 And it came to pass that he met 
Kishkumen, and he gave unto him 
a sign; therefore Kishkumen made 
known unto him the object of his 
desire, desiring that he would con-
duct him to the judgment-seat that 
he might murder Helaman.

8 And  when  the  servant  of  He-
laman had known all the heart of 
Kishkumen, and how that it was his 
a object to murder, and also that it 
was the object of all those who be-
longed to his band to murder, and 
to rob, and to gain power, (and this 
was  their  b secret  plan,  and  their 
combination) the servant of Hela-
man said unto Kishkumen: Let us 
go forth unto the judgment-seat.

9 Now this did please Kishkumen 
exceedingly, for he did suppose that 
he  should  accomplish  his  design; 
but behold, the servant of Helaman, 
as they were going forth unto the 
judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen 
even to the heart, that he fell dead 
without a groan. And he ran and 
told Helaman all the things which 
he had seen, and heard, and done.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  He-
laman did send forth to take this 
band  of  robbers  and  a secret  mur-
derers, that they might be executed 
according to the law.

11 But  behold,  when  Gadianton 
had found that Kishkumen did not 
return he feared lest that he should 
be destroyed; therefore he caused 
that  his  band  should  follow  him. 
And  they  took  their  flight  out  of

the land, by a secret way, into the 
wilderness; and thus when Helaman 
sent forth to take them they could 
nowhere be found.

12 And  more  of  this  Gadianton 
shall be spoken hereafter. And thus 
ended  the  forty  and  second  year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

13 And behold, in the end of this 
book ye shall see that this a Gadian-
ton did prove the overthrow, yea, 
almost the entire destruction of the 
people of Nephi.

14 Behold I do not mean the end 
of  the  a book  of  Helaman,  but  I  
mean the end of the book of Nephi, 
from  which  I  have  taken  all  the  
account which I have written.

CHAPTER 3

Many  Nephites  migrate  to  the  land 
northward—They  build  houses  of  ce-
ment  and  keep  many  records—Tens 
of  thousands  are  converted  and  bap-
tized—The word of God leads men to 
salvation—Nephi the son of Helaman 
fills the judgment seat. About 49–39 b.c.

And now it came to pass in the forty 
and third year of the reign of the 
judges,  there  was  no  contention 
among  the  people  of  Nephi  save 
it were a little pride which was in 
the church, which did cause some 
little dissensions among the people, 
which  affairs  were  settled  in  the 
ending of the forty and third year.
2 And  there  was  no  contention 
among  the  people  in  the  forty 
and fourth year; neither was there 
much contention in the forty and  
fifth year.

3 And it came to pass in the forty 
and sixth, yea, there was much con-
tention and many dissensions; in the 
which  there  were  an  exceedingly 
great  many  who  departed  out  of 
the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and  went 

forth unto the land a northward to 
inherit the land.

4 And  they  did  travel  to  an  ex-
ceedingly great distance, insomuch 
that they came to a large bodies of 
water and many rivers.

5 Yea,  and  even  they  did  spread 
forth  into  all  parts  of  the  land,  
into whatever parts it had not been 
rendered desolate and without tim-
ber,  because  of  the  many  inhabi-
tants who had before inherited the  
land.

6 And now no part of the land was 
desolate,  save  it  were  for  timber; 
but because of the greatness of the 
a destruction of the people who had 
before  inhabited  the  land  it  was 
called b desolate.

7 And there being but little timber 
upon  the  face  of  the  land,  never-
theless the people who went forth 
became exceedingly a expert in the 
working of cement; therefore they 
did build houses of cement, in the 
which they did dwell.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did multiply and spread, and did 
go forth from the land southward  
to  the  land  northward,  and  did 
spread insomuch that they began 
to cover the face of the whole earth, 
from the sea south to the sea north, 
from the a sea west to the sea east.

9 And the people who were in the 
land northward did dwell in a tents, 
and in houses of cement, and they 
did suffer whatsoever tree should 
spring  up  upon  the  face  of  the 
land  that  it  should  grow  up,  that 
in time they might have timber to 
build their houses, yea, their cities, 
and their temples, and their b syna-
gogues, and their sanctuaries, and 
all manner of their buildings.

10 And it came to pass as timber 
was exceedingly scarce in the land 
northward,  they  did  send  forth 
much by the way of a shipping.

11 And thus they did enable the 
people in the land northward that 
they might build many cities, both 
of wood and of cement.

12 And it came to pass that there 
were many of the  a people of Am-
mon, who were Lamanites by birth, 
did also go forth into this land.

13 And  now  there  are  many 
a records kept of the proceedings of  
this people, by many of this people,  
which are particular and very large, 
concerning them.

14 But behold, a a hundredth part 
of the proceedings of this people, 
yea,  the  account  of  the  Laman-
ites and of the Nephites, and their  
wars, and contentions, and dissen-
sions,  and  their  preaching,  and 
their prophecies, and their shipping  
and  their  building  of  ships,  and 
their building of b temples, and of 
synagogues and their c sanctuaries, 
and their righteousness, and their 
wickedness, and their murders, and 
their robbings, and their plundering,  
and all manner of abominations and 
whoredoms,  cannot  be  contained 
in this work.

15 But  behold,  there  are  many 
books and many a records of every  
kind,  and  they  have  been  kept 
chiefly by the Nephites.

16 And  they  have  been  a handed 
down  from  one  generation  to  an-
other  by  the  Nephites,  even  until 
they have fallen into transgression 
and  have  been  murdered,  plun-
dered, and hunted, and driven forth, 
and slain, and b scattered upon the 
face of the earth, and mixed with 
the  Lamanites  until  they  are  c no 
more called the Nephites, becoming 
wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, 
even becoming Lamanites.

17 And now I return again to mine 
account; therefore, what I have spo-
ken had passed after there had been 

great contentions, and disturbances, 
and wars, and dissensions, among 
the people of Nephi.

18 The forty and sixth year of the 

reign of the judges ended;

19 And it came to pass that there 
was  still  great  contention  in  the 
land,  yea,  even  in  the  forty  and 
seventh year, and also in the forty 
and eighth year.

20 Nevertheless a Helaman did fill 
the judgment-seat with justice and 
equity; yea, he did observe to keep 
the  statutes,  and  the  judgments,  
and the commandments of God; and 
he did do that which was right in 
the sight of God continually; and 
he did walk after the ways of his 
father, insomuch that he did pros-
per in the land.

21 And it came to pass that he had 
two sons. He gave unto the eldest  
the name of a Nephi, and unto the 
youngest, the name of Lehi. And they  
began to grow up unto the Lord.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
wars  and  contentions  began  to 
cease,  in  a  small  degree,  among 
the people of the Nephites, in the 
latter end of the forty and eighth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

23 And it came to pass in the forty 
and ninth year of the reign of the 
judges, there was continual peace 
established in the land, all save it 
were the a secret combinations which 
b Gadianton  the  robber  had  estab-
lished in the more settled parts of 
the land, which at that time were not 
known unto those who were at the  
head of government; therefore they 
were not destroyed out of the land.
24 And it came to pass that in this 
same  year  there  was  exceedingly 
great prosperity in the church, in-
somuch that there were thousands 
who did a join themselves unto the

church  and  were  baptized  unto  
repentance.

25 And so great was the prosper-
ity of the church, and so many the 
blessings  which  were  poured  out 
upon the people, that even the high 
priests and the teachers were them-
selves astonished beyond measure.
26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
work of the Lord did prosper unto 
the  baptizing  and  uniting  to  the 
church  of  God,  many  souls,  yea, 
even tens of thousands.

27 Thus we may see that the Lord 
is merciful unto all who will, in the 
sincerity of their hearts, call upon 
his holy name.

28 Yea, thus we see that the a gate 
of heaven is open unto b all, even to  
those who will believe on the name 
of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.
29 Yea,  we  see  that  whosoever 
will may lay hold upon the a word 
of God, which is  b quick and pow-
erful, which shall c divide asunder 
all the cunning and the snares and 
the wiles of the devil, and lead the 
man of Christ in a strait and d nar-
row course across that everlasting 
e gulf of misery which is prepared 
to engulf the wicked—

30 And land their souls, yea, their 
immortal souls, at the a right hand 
of God in the kingdom of heaven, 
to  sit  down  with  Abraham,  and 
Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all 
our holy fathers, to go no more out.
31 And in this year there was con-
tinual rejoicing in the land of Zara-
hemla, and in all the regions round 
about, even in all the land which 
was possessed by the Nephites.

32 And it came to pass that there 
was  peace  and  exceedingly  great 
joy  in  the  remainder  of  the  forty 

and ninth year; yea, and also there 
was continual peace and great joy 
in the fiftieth year of the reign of 
the judges.

33 And in the fifty and first year 
of  the  reign  of  the  judges  there 
was  peace  also,  save  it  were  the 
pride which began to enter into the 
church—not into the church of God, 
but  into  the  hearts  of  the  people  
who  a professed  to  belong  to  the  
church of God—

34 And  they  were  lifted  up  in 
a pride, even to the persecution of 
many of their brethren. Now this 
was  a  great  evil,  which  did  cause 
the more humble part of the people 
to suffer great persecutions, and to 
wade through much affliction.

35 Nevertheless they did a fast and 
b pray oft, and did wax stronger and 
stronger  in  their  c humility,  and 
firmer  and  firmer  in  the  faith  of 
Christ, unto the filling their souls 
with joy and consolation, yea, even 
to the d purifying and the e sanctifi-
cation of their hearts, which sanc-
tification cometh because of their 
f yielding their hearts unto God.

36 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
fifty and second year ended in peace 
also, save it were the exceedingly 
great pride which had gotten into 
the hearts of the people; and it was 
because of their exceedingly great 
a riches and their prosperity in the 
land;  and  it  did  grow  upon  them 
from day to day.

37 And it came to pass in the fifty 
and third year of the reign of the 
judges, a Helaman died, and his el-
dest son b Nephi began to reign in 
his stead. And it came to pass that 
he did fill the judgment-seat with 
justice and equity; yea, he did keep

the  commandments  of  God,  and 
did walk in the ways of his father.

CHAPTER 4

Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites 
join forces and take the land of Zara-
hemla—The Nephites’ defeats come be-
cause of their wickedness—The Church 
dwindles, and the people become weak 
like the Lamanites. About 38–30 b.c.
And it came to pass in the fifty and 
fourth year there were many dis-
sensions in the church, and there 
was also a  a contention among the 
people,  insomuch  that  there  was 
much bloodshed.

2 And  the  rebellious  part  were 
slain  and  driven  out  of  the  land, 
and  they  did  go  unto  the  king  of 
the Lamanites.

3 And it came to pass that they did 
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites 
to  a war  against  the  Nephites;  but 
behold, the Lamanites were b exceed-
ingly  afraid,  insomuch  that  they 
would not hearken to the words of 
those dissenters.

4 But it came to pass in the fifty 
and sixth year of the reign of the 
judges, there were a dissenters who 
went up from the Nephites unto the  
Lamanites; and they succeeded with 
those others in b stirring them up to  
anger against the Nephites; and they  
were all that year preparing for war.
5 And  in  the  fifty  and  seventh 
year they did come down against 
the  Nephites  to  battle,  and  they 
did commence the work of death; 
yea, insomuch that in the fifty and 
eighth year of the reign of the judges 
they succeeded in obtaining a pos-
session  of  the  land  of  Zarahemla; 
yea, and also all the lands, even unto 
the land which was near the land  
Bountiful.

6 And the Nephites and the armies 

of Moronihah were driven even into 
the land of Bountiful;

7 And there they did fortify against 
the Lamanites, from the west sea, 
even unto the east; it being a a day’s 
journey for a Nephite, on the line 
which they had fortified and sta-
tioned their armies to defend their 
north country.

8 And  thus  those  a dissenters  of 
the  Nephites,  with  the  help  of  a 
numerous army of the Lamanites, 
had obtained all the possession of 
the Nephites which was in the land 
southward. And all this was done 
in the fifty and eighth and ninth 
years of the reign of the judges.

9 And it came to pass in the sixti-
eth year of the reign of the judges, 
Moronihah  did  succeed  with  his 
armies in obtaining many parts of 
the land; yea, they regained many 
cities  which  had  fallen  into  the 
hands of the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass in the sixty 
and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges they succeeded in regaining 
even the half of all their possessions.
11 Now this great loss of the Neph-
ites, and the great slaughter which 
was among them, a would not have 
happened had it not been for their 
b wickedness and their abomination 
which was among them; yea, and it 
was among those also who professed 
to belong to the church of God.

12 And it was because of the a pride 
of their hearts, because of their ex-
ceeding b riches, yea, it was because 
of  their  oppression  to  the  c poor, 
withholding  their  food  from  the 
hungry, withholding their clothing 
from the naked, and smiting their 
humble brethren upon the cheek, 
making  a  d mock  of  that  which 
was  sacred,  denying  the  spirit  of 
prophecy  and  of  revelation,  mur-
dering, plundering, lying, stealing,

committing adultery, rising up in 
great  contentions,  and  deserting 
away into the land of Nephi, among 
the Lamanites—

13 And because of this their great 
wickedness,  and  their  a boastings  
in  their  own  strength,  they  were 
left in their own strength; therefore  
they  did  not  prosper,  but  were  
afflicted  and  smitten,  and  driven 
before  the  Lamanites,  until  they 
had  lost  possession  of  almost  all 
their lands.

14 But  behold,  Moronihah  did 
a preach many things unto the peo-
ple because of their iniquity, and 
also  b Nephi  and  Lehi,  who  were 
the  sons  of  Helaman,  did  preach 
many things unto the people, yea, 
and did prophesy many things unto  
them  concerning  their  iniquities, 
and what should come unto them 
if they did not repent of their sins.
15 And it came to pass that they 
did repent, and inasmuch as they 
did repent they did begin to prosper.
16 For when Moronihah saw that 
they did repent he did venture to 
a lead them forth from place to place, 
and  from  city  to  city,  even  until 
they had regained the one-half of  
their  property  and  the  one-half  
of all their lands.

17 And thus ended the sixty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.
18 And it came to pass in the sixty 
and second year of the reign of the 
judges,  that  Moronihah  could  ob-
tain no more possessions over the 
Lamanites.

19 Therefore  they  did  abandon 
their design to obtain the remain-
der of their lands, for so numerous 
were the Lamanites that it became 
impossible for the Nephites to ob-
tain more power over them; there-
fore Moronihah did employ all his 

armies in maintaining those parts 
which he had taken.

20 And it came to pass, because of 
the greatness of the number of the 
Lamanites the Nephites were in great 
fear, lest they should be overpow-
ered, and trodden down, and slain,  
and destroyed.

21 Yea, they began to remember 
the a prophecies of Alma, and also the 
b words of Mosiah; and they saw that 
they had been a c stiffnecked people, 
and that they had set at d naught the  
commandments of God;

22 And that they had altered and 
trampled under their feet the a laws 
of Mosiah, or that which the Lord 
commanded him to give unto the 
people; and they saw that their laws 
had  become  corrupted,  and  that 
they had become a wicked people, 
insomuch  that  they  were  wicked 
even like unto the Lamanites.

23 And because of their iniquity 
the church had begun to a dwindle; 
and they began to disbelieve in the 
spirit of prophecy and in the spirit 
of revelation; and the judgments of  
God did stare them in the face.

24 And they saw that they had be-
come a weak, like unto their brethren,  
the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of 
the Lord did no more preserve them; 
yea, it had withdrawn from them 
because the Spirit of the Lord doth 
not b dwell in c unholy d temples—

25 Therefore the Lord did cease to 
preserve them by his miraculous and 
matchless power, for they had fallen 
into a state of a unbelief and awful 
wickedness; and they saw that the 
Lamanites were exceedingly more 
numerous than they, and except they 
should b cleave unto the Lord their  
God they must unavoidably perish.
26 For behold, they saw that the 
strength  of  the  Lamanites  was  as

great as their strength, even man for 
man. And thus had they fallen into 
this great transgression; yea, thus 
had  they  become  a weak,  because  
of their transgression, in the space of  
b not many years.

CHAPTER 5
Nephi  and  Lehi  devote  themselves  to 
preaching—Their names invite them to 
pattern their lives after their forebears—
Christ  redeems  those  who  repent—
Nephi and Lehi make many converts 
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles 
them—A cloud of darkness overshad-
ows three hundred people—The earth 
shakes, and a voice commands men to 
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with 
angels, and the multitude is encircled 
by fire. About 30 b.c.
And it came to pass that in this same 
year, behold, a Nephi b delivered up 
the judgment-seat to a man whose 
name was c Cezoram.

2 For as their laws and their gov-
ernments were established by the 
a voice of the people, and they who 
b chose  evil  were  c more  numerous 
than they who chose good, therefore 
they were d ripening for destruction, 
for the laws had become corrupted.
3 Yea,  and  this  was  not  all;  they 
were  a  a stiffnecked  people,  inso-
much that they could not be gov-
erned by the law nor justice, save 
it were to their destruction.

4 And it came to pass that Nephi 
had become weary because of their 
iniquity;  and  he  yielded  up  the 
judgment-seat,  and  took  it  upon 
him to preach the word of God all 
the remainder of his days, and his 
brother Lehi also, all the remain-
der of his days;

5 For they remembered the words 
which their a father Helaman spake 
unto them. And these are the words 
which he spake:

6 Behold,  my  sons,  I  desire  that 
ye  should  remember  to  keep  the 
commandments  of  God;  and  I 
would that ye should declare unto 
the people these words. Behold, I 
have given unto you the names of 
our  first  a parents  who  came  out  
of the land of Jerusalem; and this 
I have done that when you remem-
ber your names ye may remember 
them; and when ye remember them 
ye may remember their works; and 
when ye remember their works ye 
may know how that it is said, and 
also written, that they were b good.
7 Therefore, my sons, I would that 
ye  should  do  that  which  is  good, 
that it may be said of you, and also 
written, even as it has been said and 
written of them.

8 And now my sons, behold I have 
somewhat  more  to  desire  of  you, 
which  desire  is,  that  ye  may  not 
do these things that ye may boast, 
but that ye may do these things to 
lay up for yourselves a a treasure in 
heaven, yea, which is eternal, and 
which  fadeth  not  away;  yea,  that 
ye may have that b precious gift of 
eternal life, which we have reason 
to suppose hath been given to our 
fathers.

9 O remember, remember, my sons, 
the  a words  which  king  Benjamin 
spake unto his people; yea, remem-
ber that there is no other way nor 
means whereby man can be saved, 
only  through  the  b atoning  blood  
of  Jesus  Christ,  who  shall  come; 
yea, remember that he cometh to 
c redeem the d world.

10 And remember also the words 
which  Amulek  spake  unto  Zeez-
rom,  a in  the  city  of  Ammonihah; 
for he said unto him that the Lord 
surely should come to redeem his 
people, but that he should not come  
to redeem them in their sins, but to 
redeem them from their sins.

11 And he hath power given unto 
him  from  the  Father  to  redeem 
them from their sins because of re-
pentance; therefore he hath  a sent 
his  angels  to  declare  the  tidings 
of  the  conditions  of  repentance, 
which bringeth unto the power of 
the Redeemer, unto the salvation of  
their souls.

12 And now, my sons, remember, 
remember that it is upon the a rock 
of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the 
Son of God, that ye must build your 
b foundation;  that  when  the  devil 
shall send forth his mighty winds, 
yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, 
when  all  his  hail  and  his  mighty 
c storm shall beat upon you, it shall 
have no power over you to drag you 
down to the gulf of misery and end-
less wo, because of the rock upon 
which ye are built, which is a sure 
foundation, a foundation whereon 
if men build they cannot fall.

13 And it came to pass that these 
were  the  words  which  Helaman 
a taught  to  his  sons;  yea,  he  did 
teach them many things which are 
not written, and also many things 
which are written.

14 And  they  did  remember  his 
words;  and  therefore  they  went 
forth, keeping the commandments 
of  God,  to  teach  the  word  of  God 
among all the people of Nephi, be-
ginning at the city Bountiful;

15 And  from  thenceforth  to  the 

city  of  Gid;  and  from  the  city  of 
Gid to the city of Mulek;

16 And even from one city to an-
other,  until  they  had  gone  forth 
a among  all  the  people  of  Nephi 
who  were  in  the  land  southward; 
and from thence into the land of 
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.
17 And it came to pass that they 
did a preach with great b power, inso-
much that they did confound many 
of those c dissenters who had gone 
over from the Nephites, insomuch 
that they came forth and did con-
fess  their  sins  and  were  baptized 
unto repentance, and immediately 
returned to the Nephites to endeavor 
to  repair  unto  them  the  wrongs 
which they had done.

18 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did preach unto the Laman-
ites with such great power and author-
ity, for they had power and authority 
given  unto  them  that  they  might  
a speak, and they also had what they 
should speak given unto them—

19 Therefore they did speak unto 
the great astonishment of the La-
manites,  to  the  convincing  them, 
insomuch that there were eight thou-
sand of the Lamanites who were in  
the land of Zarahemla and round 
about  a baptized  unto  repentance, 
and were convinced of the  b wick-
edness  of  the  c traditions  of  their 
fathers.

20 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did proceed from thence 
to go to the a land of Nephi.

21 And it came to pass that they 
were taken by an army of the La-
manites and cast into a prison; yea, 
even in that same prison in which 
Ammon and his brethren were cast 
by the servants of Limhi.

22 And after they had been cast 
into  prison  many  days  without 
food, behold, they went forth into 
the prison to take them that they 
might slay them.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi were encircled about a as 
if by b fire, even insomuch that they 
durst not lay their hands upon them 
for fear lest they should be burned. 
Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were 
not burned; and they were as stand-
ing in the midst of fire and were 
not burned.

24 And when they saw that they 
were encircled about with a a pillar 
of fire, and that it burned them not, 
their hearts did take courage.

25 For they saw that the Laman-
ites durst not lay their hands upon 
them; neither durst they come near 
unto them, but stood as if they were 
struck dumb with amazement.

26 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did stand forth and began 
to speak unto them, saying:  a Fear 
not, for behold, it is God that has 
shown  unto  you  this  marvelous 
thing, in the which is shown unto 
you that ye cannot lay your hands 
on us to slay us.

27 And  behold,  when  they  had 
said these words, the earth shook 
exceedingly,  and  the  walls  of  the 
prison  did  shake  as  if  they  were 
about to tumble to the earth; but 
behold, they did not fall. And be-
hold, they that were in the prison 
were Lamanites and Nephites who 
were dissenters.

28 And it came to pass that they 
were  overshadowed  with  a  cloud 
of a darkness, and an awful solemn 
fear came upon them.

29 And it came to pass that there 
came a a voice as if it were above the 
cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, 

repent ye, and seek no more to de-
stroy my b servants whom I have sent  
unto you to declare good tidings.

30 And it came to pass when they 
heard this a voice, and beheld that 
it was not a voice of thunder, nei-
ther  was  it  a  voice  of  a  great  tu-
multuous noise, but behold, it was 
a  b still  voice  of  perfect  mildness, 
as if it had been a whisper, and it 
did pierce even to the very soul—
31 And notwithstanding the mild-
ness of the voice, behold the earth 
shook exceedingly, and the walls of 
the prison trembled again, as if it 
were about to tumble to the earth; 
and behold the cloud of darkness, 
which had overshadowed them, did 
not disperse—

32 And  behold  the  voice  came 
again,  saying:  a Repent  ye,  repent 
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand; and seek no more to destroy 
my servants. And it came to pass 
that the earth shook again, and the 
walls trembled.

33 And also again the third time the 
voice came, and did speak unto them 
marvelous words which a cannot be 
uttered by man; and the walls did 
tremble again, and the earth shook  
as if it were about to divide asunder.
34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites could not flee because 
of the cloud of darkness which did 
overshadow them; yea, and also they 
were immovable because of the fear 
which did come upon them.

35 Now there was one among them 
who was a Nephite by birth, who 
had once belonged to the church of 
God but had dissented from them.
36 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
turned him about, and behold, he 
saw through the cloud of darkness 
the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and be-
hold, they did a shine exceedingly,

even  as  the  faces  of  angels.  And 
he  beheld  that  they  did  lift  their 
eyes  to  heaven;  and  they  were  in 
the attitude as if talking or lifting 
their  voices  to  some  being  whom 
they beheld.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  this 
man  did  cry  unto  the  multitude, 
that they might turn and look. And 
behold, there was power given unto 
them that they did turn and look; 
and  they  did  behold  the  faces  of 
Nephi and Lehi.

38 And  they  said  unto  the  man: 
Behold,  what  do  all  these  things 
mean,  and  who  is  it  with  whom 
these men do converse?

39 Now  the  man’s  name  was 
Amina dab.  And  Aminadab  said 
unto them: They do converse with 
the angels of God.

40 And it came to pass that the La-
manites said unto him: a What shall 
we do, that this cloud of darkness 
may  be  removed  from  overshad-
owing us?

41 And Aminadab said unto them: 
You must a repent, and cry unto the 
voice, even until ye shall have b faith 
in Christ, who was taught unto you 
by Alma, and  c Amulek, and Zeez-
rom; and when ye shall do this, the 
cloud of darkness shall be removed 
from overshadowing you.

42 And it came to pass that they 
all did begin to cry unto the voice 
of him who had shaken the earth; 
yea,  they  did  cry  even  until  the 
cloud of darkness was dispersed.

43 And it came to pass that when 
they cast their eyes about, and saw 
that the cloud of darkness was dis-
persed from overshadowing them, 
behold,  they  saw  that  they  were 
a encircled  about,  yea  every  soul, 
by a pillar of fire.

44 And a Nephi and b Lehi were in 
the midst of them; yea, they were 
encircled about; yea, they were as 

if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet 
it did harm them not, neither did 
it take hold upon the walls of the 
prison;  and  they  were  filled  with 
that c joy which is unspeakable and 
full of glory.

45 And behold, the a Holy Spirit of 
God did come down from heaven, 
and did enter into their hearts, and  
they  were  filled  as  if  with  fire,  
and they could  b speak forth mar-
velous words.

46 And it came to pass that there 
came  a  voice  unto  them,  yea,  a 
pleasant voice, as if it were a whis-
per, saying:

47 a Peace, peace be unto you, be-
cause of your faith in my Well Be-
loved, who was from the foundation 
of the world.

48 And now, when they heard this 
they cast up their eyes as if to be-
hold from whence the voice came; 
and behold, they saw the a heavens 
open;  and  angels  came  down  out 
of  heaven  and  ministered  unto  
them.

49 And  there  were  about  three 
hundred souls who saw and heard 
these things; and they were bidden 
to go forth and marvel not, neither 
should they doubt.

50 And it came to pass that they 
did go forth, and did minister unto 
the  people,  declaring  throughout 
all the regions round about all the 
things which they had heard and 
seen, insomuch that the more part 
of the Lamanites were a convinced 
of  them,  because  of  the  great-
ness  of  the  evidences  which  they  
had received.

51 And as many as were a convinced 
did  lay  down  their  weapons  of  
war, and also their hatred and the 
tradition of their fathers.

52 And it came to pass that they 
did a yield up unto the Nephites the 
lands of their possession.

HELAMAN 6  : 1–12

CHAPTER 6

The righteous Lamanites preach to the 
wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper 
during  an  era  of  peace  and  plenty—
Lucifer, the author of sin, stirs up the 
hearts of the wicked and the Gadianton 
robbers in murder and wickedness—The 
robbers take over the Nephite govern-
ment. About 29–23 b.c.
And it came to pass that when the 
sixty and second year of the reign 
of the judges had ended, all these 
things had happened and the La-
manites had become, the more part 
of them, a righteous people, inso-
much that their a righteousness did 
exceed that of the Nephites, because 
of their firmness and their steadi-
ness in the faith.

2 For behold, there were many of 
the Nephites who had become a hard-
ened  and  impenitent  and  grossly 
wicked,  insomuch  that  they  did 
reject the word of God and all the 
preaching and prophesying which 
did come among them.

3 Nevertheless, the people of the 
church did have great joy because 
of  the  conversion  of  the  Laman-
ites, yea, because of the church of  
God,  which  had  been  established 
among them. And they did a fellow-
ship one with another, and did re-
joice one with another, and did have  
great joy.

4 And it came to pass that many 
of  the  Lamanites  did  come  down 
into  the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and 
did declare unto the people of the 
Nephites the manner of their a con-
version,  and  did  exhort  them  to 
faith and repentance.

5 Yea, and many did a preach with 
exceedingly great power and author-
ity, unto the bringing down many 

of them into the depths of humil-
ity, to be the humble followers of 
God and the Lamb.

6 And it came to pass that many of 
the Lamanites did go into the land 
northward;  and  also  a Nephi  and 
b Lehi went into the c land northward, 
to preach unto the people. And thus 
ended the sixty and third year.

7 And behold, there was peace in 
all the land, insomuch that the Neph-
ites did go into whatsoever part of 
the land they would, whether among  
the Nephites or the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did also go whithersoever  
they would, whether it were among 
the Lamanites or among the Neph-
ites;  and  thus  they  did  have  free  
intercourse  one  with  another,  to  
a buy  and  to  sell,  and  to  get  gain, 
according to their desire.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
became exceedingly rich, both the 
Lamanites  and  the  Nephites;  and 
they did have an exceeding plenty 
of  a gold,  and  of  silver,  and  of  all 
manner of precious metals, both in  
the land south and in the land north.
10 Now the land south was called 
a Lehi, and the land north was called 
b Mulek, which was after the c son of 
Zedekiah;  for  the  Lord  did  bring 
Mulek into the land north, and Lehi 
into the land south.

11 And behold, there was all man-
ner of gold in both these lands, and 
of silver, and of precious ore of ev-
ery kind; and there were also cu-
rious workmen, who did a work all 
kinds of ore and did refine it; and 
thus they did become rich.

12 They did raise grain in abun-
dance, both in the north and in the 
south; and they did flourish exceed-
ingly, both in the north and in the

south. And they did multiply and 
wax exceedingly strong in the land. 
And they did raise many flocks and 
herds, yea, many fatlings.

13 Behold  their  women  did  toil 
and spin, and did a make all manner 
of b cloth, of fine-twined linen and 
cloth of every kind, to clothe their 
nakedness. And thus the sixty and 
fourth year did pass away in peace.
14 And in the sixty and fifth year 
they did also have great joy and peace, 
yea,  much  preaching  and  many 
prophecies concerning that which 
was to come. And thus passed away  
the sixty and fifth year.

15 And it came to pass that in the 
sixty and sixth year of the reign of 
the judges, behold,  a Cezoram was 
murdered by an unknown hand as 
he sat upon the judgment-seat. And 
it  came  to  pass  that  in  the  same 
year, that his son, who had been ap-
pointed by the people in his stead, 
was also murdered. And thus ended  
the sixty and sixth year.

16 And  in  the  commencement 
of  the  sixty  and  seventh  year  the 
people began to grow exceedingly 
wicked again.

17 For behold, the Lord had blessed 
them  so  long  with  the  a riches  of 
the world that they had not been 
stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to 
bloodshed; therefore they began to 
set their hearts upon their riches; 
yea, they began to seek to get gain 
that  they  might  be  lifted  up  one 
above another; therefore they began 
to commit b secret murders, and to 
rob and to plunder, that they might 
get gain.

18 And now behold, those murder-
ers and plunderers were a band who 
had been formed by Kishkumen and 
a Gadianton. And now it had come 
to pass that there were many, even 
among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s  

band. But behold, they were more 
numerous among the more wicked 
part  of  the  Lamanites.  And  they 
were called Gadianton’s robbers and  
murderers.

19 And it was they who did mur-
der the chief judge a Cezoram, and 
his son, while in the judgment-seat; 
and behold, they were not found.

20 And now it came to pass that 
when  the  Lamanites  found  that 
there were robbers among them they 
were  exceedingly  sorrowful;  and 
they did use every means in their 
power to destroy them off the face  
of the earth.

21 But  behold,  Satan  did  stir  up 
the a hearts of the more part of the 
Nephites, insomuch that they did 
unite with those bands of robbers, 
and did enter into their covenants 
and  their  oaths,  that  they  would 
protect and preserve one another in 
whatsoever difficult circumstances 
they  should  be  placed,  that  they 
should not suffer for their murders, 
and  their  plunderings,  and  their  
b stealings.

22 And it came to pass that they 
did have their signs, yea, their a se-
cret signs, and their b secret words; 
and this that they might distinguish 
a brother who had entered into the 
covenant, that whatsoever wicked-
ness his brother should do he should 
not be injured by his brother, nor by 
those who did belong to his band, 
who had taken this covenant.

23 And thus they might murder, 
and plunder, and steal, and commit  
a whoredoms  and  all  manner  of 
wickedness,  contrary  to  the  laws  
of their country and also the laws of  
their God.

24 And whosoever of those who be-
longed to their band should reveal 
unto the world of their a wickedness 
and their abominations, should be

tried, not according to the laws of 
their country, but according to the 
laws  of  their  wickedness,  which 
had been given by Gadianton and 
Kishkumen.

25 Now behold, it is these secret 
a oaths and covenants which Alma 
commanded  his  son  should  not 
go forth unto the world, lest they 
should be a means of bringing down 
the people unto destruction.

26 Now behold, those a secret oaths 
and covenants did not come forth 
unto Gadianton from the b records 
which were delivered unto Helaman; 
but behold, they were put into the  
heart of   c Gadianton by that d same be-
ing who did entice our first parents  
to partake of the forbidden fruit—
27 Yea, that same being who did 
plot  with  a Cain,  that  if  he  would 
murder his brother Abel it should 
not be known unto the world. And 
he did plot with Cain and his fol-
lowers from that time forth.

28 And also it is that same being 
who  put  it  into  the  hearts  of  the 
people to a build a tower sufficiently 
high that they might get to heaven. 
And it was that same being who led 
on the people who came from that 
tower  into  this  land;  who  spread 
the works of darkness and abomi-
nations over all the face of the land, 
until he dragged the people down 
to an b entire destruction, and to an 
everlasting hell.

29 Yea, it is that same being who 
put it into the heart of a Gadianton 
to still carry on the work of dark-
ness, and of secret murder; and he 
has brought it forth from the begin-
ning of man even down to this time.
30 And behold, it is he who is the 
a author of all sin. And behold, he 
doth carry on his works of darkness 

and secret murder, and doth hand 
down their plots, and their oaths, 
and their covenants, and their plans 
of awful wickedness, from genera-
tion to generation according as he 
can get hold upon the hearts of the 
children of men.

31 And  now  behold,  he  had  got 
great hold upon the hearts of the 
Nephites; yea, insomuch that they 
had become exceedingly wicked; yea, 
the more part of them had turned 
out  of  the  a way  of  righteousness,  
and did b trample under their feet 
the commandments of God, and did  
turn  unto  their  own  ways,  and  
did build up unto themselves c idols 
of their gold and their silver.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  all 
these iniquities did come unto them 
in  the  space  of  a not  many  years,  
insomuch that a more part of it had 
come  unto  them  in  the  sixty  and 
seventh  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges over the people of Nephi.

33 And they did grow in their in-
iquities in the sixty and eighth year  
also, to the great sorrow and lam-
entation of the righteous.

34 And thus we see that the a Neph-
ites did begin to dwindle in unbe-
lief,  and  grow  in  wickedness  and 
abominations, while the Lamanites 
began to grow exceedingly in the 
knowledge of their God; yea, they 
did begin to keep his statutes and 
commandments,  and  to  walk  in 
truth and uprightness before him.
35 And thus we see that the Spirit 
of  the  Lord  began  to  a withdraw 
from the Nephites, because of the 
wickedness  and  the  hardness  of 
their hearts.

36 And thus we see that the Lord 
began to pour out his a Spirit upon 
the  Lamanites,  because  of  their

easiness and b willingness to believe 
in his words.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  did  hunt  the  band  of 
robbers  of  Gadianton;  and  they 
did preach the word of God among 
the more wicked part of them, in-
somuch that this band of robbers 
was utterly destroyed from among 
the Lamanites.

38 And  it  came  to  pass  on  the 
other hand, that the Nephites did 
build them up and support them, 
beginning at the more wicked part 
of them, until they had overspread 
all  the  land  of  the  Nephites,  and 
had seduced the more part of the 
righteous until they had come down 
to believe in their works and par-
take of their spoils, and to join with 
them in their secret murders and 
combinations.

39 And thus they did obtain the 
sole  management  of  the  govern-
ment, insomuch that they did tram-
ple under their feet and smite and 
rend and turn their backs upon the 
a poor and the meek, and the hum-
ble followers of God.

40 And thus we see that they were 
in an awful state, and a ripening for 
an everlasting destruction.

41 And it came to pass that thus 
ended  the  sixty  and  eighth  year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

The Prophecy of Nephi, the Son of  
Helaman—God threatens the people 
of Nephi that he will visit them in 
his anger, to their utter destruction 
except  they  repent  of  their  wick-
edness. God smiteth the people of 
Nephi with pestilence; they repent 
and turn unto him. Samuel, a Laman-
ite, prophesies unto the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 7 through 16.

CHAPTER 7

Nephi is rejected in the north and returns 
to Zarahemla—He prays upon his gar-
den tower and then calls upon the people 
to repent or perish. About 23–21 b.c.

Behold, now it came to pass in the 
sixty and ninth year of the reign of 
the judges over the people of the 
Nephites,  that  Nephi,  the  son  of 
Helaman, a returned to the land of 
Zarahemla from the land northward.
2 For he had been forth among the 
people who were in the land north-
ward, and did preach the word of 
God unto them, and did prophesy 
many things unto them;

3 And they did a reject all his words, 
insomuch  that  he  could  not  stay 
among  them,  but  returned  again 
unto the land of his nativity.

4 And seeing the people in a state 
of  such  awful  wickedness,  and 
those Gadianton robbers filling the  
judgment-seats—having  a usurped 
the power and authority of the land; 
laying  aside  the  commandments 
of God, and not in the least aright 
before him; doing no justice unto 
the children of men;

5 Condemning  the  righteous  be-
cause of their righteousness; letting 
the guilty and the wicked go a un-
punished because of their b money; 
and moreover to be held in office 
at the head of government, to rule 
and  do  according  to  their  wills, 
that they might get gain and glory 
of the  c world, and, moreover, that 
they might the more easily commit 
adultery,  and  steal,  and  kill,  and 
do according to their own wills—

6 Now this great iniquity had come 
upon the Nephites, in the space of 
a not many years; and when Nephi 
saw it, his heart was swollen with 
sorrow within his breast; and he did 
exclaim in the agony of his soul:

7 Oh,  that  I  could  have  had  my 
days  in  the  days  when  my  father 
Nephi first came out of the land of 
Jerusalem, that I could have a joyed 
with him in the promised land; then 
were his people easy to be entreated, 
b firm to keep the commandments  
of God, and slow to be led to do iniq-
uity; and they were quick to hearken 
unto the words of the Lord—

8 Yea, if my days could have been 
in those days, then would my soul 
have had joy in the righteousness 
of my brethren.

9 But behold, I am consigned that 
these are my days, and that my soul 
shall be filled with a sorrow because of 
this the wickedness of my brethren.
10 And behold, now it came to pass  
that it was upon a tower, which was  
in  the  a garden  of  Nephi,  which  
was by the highway which led to  
the chief market, which was in the  
city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi 
had bowed himself upon the tower 
which  was  in  his  garden,  which 
tower was also near unto the garden  
gate by which led the highway.

11 And it came to pass that there 
were  certain  men  passing  by  and 
saw Nephi as he was pouring out his 
soul unto God upon the a tower; and 
they ran and told the people what 
they had seen, and the people came 
together  in  multitudes  that  they 
might know the cause of so great  
mourning  for  the  wickedness  of 
the people.

12 And now, when Nephi arose he 
beheld  the  multitudes  of  people 
who had gathered together.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
opened  his  mouth  and  said  unto 
them: Behold, a why have ye gath-
ered  yourselves  together?  That  I  
may tell you of your iniquities?

14 Yea,  because  I  have  got  upon 
my  tower  that  I  might  pour  out 
my soul unto my God, because of 
the exceeding sorrow of my heart, 
which is because of your iniquities!
15 And because of my a mourning 
and lamentation ye have gathered 
yourselves  together,  and  do  mar-
vel;  yea,  and  ye  have  great  need 
to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel 
because ye are given away that the 
devil  has  got  so  great  hold  upon  
your hearts.

16 Yea, how could you have given 
way  to  the  enticing  of  him  who  
is seeking to hurl away your souls 
down  to  a everlasting  misery  and 
endless wo?

17 O repent ye, repent ye!  a Why 
will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto 
the  Lord  your  God.  Why  has  he 
forsaken you?

18 It  is  because  you  have  hard-
ened your hearts; yea, ye will not 
a hearken unto the voice of the b good 
shepherd;  yea,  ye  have  c provoked 
him to anger against you.

19 And behold, instead of  a gath-
ering  you,  except  ye  will  repent, 
behold, he shall scatter you forth 
that ye shall become meat for dogs 
and wild beasts.

20 O, how could you have a forgot-
ten your God in the very day that 
he has delivered you?

21 But behold, it is to get a gain, to 
be  b praised of men, yea, and that 
ye might get gold and silver. And 
ye  have  set  your  hearts  upon  the 
c riches and the vain things of this 
world, for the which ye do murder, 
and  plunder,  and  steal,  and  bear 
d false witness against your neigh-
bor, and do all manner of iniquity.
22 And for this cause a wo shall come 
unto  you  except  ye  shall  repent.

For  if  ye  will  not  repent,  behold, 
this  b great city, and also all those 
great cities which are round about, 
which are in the land of our pos-
session,  shall  be  taken  away  that 
ye shall have no place in them; for 
behold, the Lord will not grant unto 
you  c strength,  as  he  has  hitherto 
done,  to  withstand  against  your  
enemies.

23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: 
I will not show unto the wicked of 
my strength, to one more than the 
other,  save  it  be  unto  those  who 
repent  of  their  sins,  and  hearken 
unto  my  words.  Now  therefore,  I 
would  that  ye  should  behold,  my 
brethren, that it shall be a better for 
the Lamanites than for you except 
ye shall repent.

24 For behold, they are more righ-
teous than you, for they have not 
sinned against that great knowledge 
which ye have received; therefore 
the Lord will be merciful unto them; 
yea, he will a lengthen out their days 
and increase their seed, even when 
thou shalt be utterly b destroyed ex-
cept thou shalt repent.

25 Yea,  wo  be  unto  you  because 
of  that  great  abomination  which 
has come among you; and ye have 
united  yourselves  unto  it,  yea,  to 
that a secret band which was estab-
lished by Gadianton!

26 Yea,  a wo shall come unto you 
because of that pride which ye have 
suffered to enter your hearts, which 
has lifted you up beyond that which 
is good because of your exceedingly 
great riches!

27 Yea, wo be unto you because of 
your wickedness and abominations!
28 And except ye repent ye shall 
perish; yea, even your lands shall 
be taken from you, and ye shall be 
destroyed from off the face of the  
earth.

29 Behold now, I do not say that 

these  things  shall  be,  of  myself, 
because  it  is  not  of  myself  that  
I a know these things; but behold, I  
b know that these things are true be-
cause the Lord God has made them 
known unto me, therefore I testify 
that they shall be.

CHAPTER 8

Corrupt judges seek to incite the peo-
ple against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, 
Zenos,  Zenock,  Ezias,  Isaiah,  Jere-
miah,  Lehi,  and  Nephi  all  testified 
of  Christ—By  inspiration  Nephi  an-
nounces the murder of the chief judge. 
About 23–21 b.c.
And now it came to pass that when 
Nephi had said these words, behold, 
there were men who were judges, 
who  also  belonged  to  the  secret 
band of Gadianton, and they were 
angry, and they cried out against 
him, saying unto the people: Why 
do ye not seize upon this man and 
bring  him  forth,  that  he  may  be 
condemned according to the crime 
which he has done?

2 Why  seest  thou  this  man,  and 
hearest him revile against this peo-
ple and against our law?

3 For  behold,  Nephi  had  spoken 
unto them concerning the corrupt-
ness of their law; yea, many things 
did Nephi speak which cannot be 
written; and nothing did he speak 
which  was  contrary  to  the  com-
mandments of God.

4 And  those  judges  were  angry 
with him because he a spake plainly 
unto them concerning their secret 
works  of  darkness;  nevertheless, 
they durst not lay their own hands 
upon him, for they feared the peo-
ple lest they should cry out against 
them.

5 Therefore they did cry unto the 
people, saying: Why do you suffer 
this man to revile against us? For

behold  he  doth  condemn  all  this 
people, even unto destruction; yea, 
and also that these our  a great cit-
ies shall be taken from us, that we 
shall have no place in them.

6 And  now  we  know  that  this  is 
impossible, for behold, we are a pow-
erful, and our cities great, therefore 
our  enemies  can  have  no  power  
over us.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  thus 
they did a stir up the people to anger 
against Nephi, and raised conten-
tions among them; for there were 
some who did cry out: b Let this man 
alone,  for  he  is  a  good  man,  and  
those  things  which  he  saith  will 
surely come to pass except we repent;
8 Yea, behold, all the judgments 
will  come  upon  us  which  he  has 
testified unto us; for we know that 
he has testified aright unto us con-
cerning our iniquities. And behold 
they are many, and he a knoweth as 
well  all  things  which  shall  befall 
us as he knoweth of our iniquities;
9 Yea, and behold, if he had not 
been a prophet he could not have 
a testified concerning those things.
10 And it came to pass that those 
people who sought to destroy Nephi 
were compelled because of their fear, 
that  they  did  not  lay  their  hands 
on him; therefore he began again  
to  speak  unto  them,  seeing  that 
he had gained favor in the eyes of 
some, insomuch that the remainder 
of them did fear.

11 Therefore he was constrained 
to  speak  more  unto  them  saying: 
Behold, my brethren, have ye not 
read that God gave power unto one 
man, even Moses, to smite upon the 
waters  of  the  a Red  Sea,  and  they 
parted hither and thither, insomuch  

that  the  Israelites,  who  were  our 
fathers,  came  through  upon  dry 
ground, and the waters closed upon 
the  armies  of  the  Egyptians  and 
swallowed them up?

12 And now behold, if God gave 
unto  this  man  such  power,  then 
why should ye dispute among your-
selves, and say that he hath given 
unto me no power whereby I may 
a know  concerning  the  judgments 
that  shall  come  upon  you  except 
ye repent?

13 But, behold, ye not only deny 
my words, but ye also deny all the 
words  which  have  been  spoken 
by our fathers, and also the words 
which  were  spoken  by  this  man, 
Moses, who had such great power 
given  unto  him,  yea,  the  words 
which he hath spoken concerning 
the coming of the Messiah.

14 Yea, did he not bear record that 
the Son of God should come? And 
as he a lifted up the brazen serpent 
in the wilderness, even so shall he 
be lifted up who should come.

15 And  as  many  as  should  look 
upon that serpent should a live, even 
so as many as should look upon the 
Son of God with faith, having a con-
trite spirit, might b live, even unto 
that life which is eternal.

16 And  now  behold,  Moses  did 
not only testify of these things, but 
also a all the holy prophets, from his 
days even to the days of Abraham.
17 Yea, and behold, a Abraham saw 
of his coming, and was filled with 
gladness and did rejoice.

18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, 
that  Abraham  not  only  knew  of 
these things, but there were a many 
before  the  days  of  Abraham  who 
were called by the  b order of God;

yea, even after the order of his Son; 
and  this  that  it  should  be  shown 
unto  the  people,  a  great  many 
thousand years before his coming, 
that even redemption should come  
unto them.

19 And now I would that ye should 
know, that even since the days of 
Abraham  there  have  been  many 
prophets that have testified these 
things;  yea,  behold,  the  prophet 
a Zenos  did  testify  boldly;  for  the 
which he was slain.

20 And behold, also a Zenock, and 
also  b Ezias,  and  also  c Isaiah,  and 
d Jeremiah,  ( Jeremiah  being  that 
same prophet who testified of the 
destruction  of  e Jerusalem)  and 
now we know that Jerusalem was 
destroyed  according  to  the  words 
of  Jeremiah.  O  then  why  not  the 
Son of God come, according to his 
prophecy ?

21 And now will you dispute that 
a Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye 
say that the b sons of Zedekiah were 
not slain, all except it were c Mulek? 
Yea, and do ye not behold that the 
seed of Zedekiah are with us, and 
they  were  driven  out  of  the  land 
of  Jerusalem?  But  behold,  this  is 
not all—

22 Our  father  Lehi  was  driven  
out  of  Jerusalem  because  he  a tes-
tified  of  these  things.  Nephi  also  
testified  of  these  things,  and  also 
almost all of our fathers, even down 
to this time; yea, they have testified 
of the b coming of Christ, and have 
looked forward, and have rejoiced 
in his day which is to come.

23 And behold, he is God, and he 

is a with them, and he did manifest 
himself unto them, that they were 
redeemed  by  him;  and  they  gave 
unto  him  glory,  because  of  that 
which is to come.

24 And now, seeing ye know these 
things  and  cannot  deny  them  ex-
cept ye shall lie, therefore in this 
ye have sinned, for ye have rejected 
all  these  things,  notwithstanding  
so many a evidences which ye have 
received; yea, even ye have received  
b all things, both things in heaven, 
and  all  things  which  are  in  the  
earth,  as  a  witness  that  they  are  
true.

25 But behold, ye have rejected the 
truth,  and  a rebelled  against  your 
holy  God;  and  even  at  this  time, 
in stead of laying up for yourselves 
b treasures in heaven, where nothing 
doth corrupt, and where nothing can  
come which is unclean, ye are heap-
ing up for yourselves wrath against 
the day of c judgment.

26 Yea,  even  at  this  time  ye  are 
ripening, because of your murders 
and your a fornication and wicked-
ness,  for  everlasting  destruction; 
yea,  and  except  ye  repent  it  will 
come unto you soon.

27 Yea,  behold  it  is  now  even  at 
your doors; yea, go ye in unto the 
judgment-seat, and search; and be-
hold, your judge is murdered, and 
he a lieth in his blood; and he hath 
been murdered b by his brother, who 
seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.
28 And behold, they both belong 
to your secret band, whose a author  
is Gadianton and the evil one who 
seeketh to destroy the souls of men.

HELAMAN 9  : 1–14

CHAPTER 9

Messengers  find  the  chief  judge  dead 
at the judgment seat—They are impris-
oned and later released—By inspiration 
Nephi identifies Seantum as the mur-
derer—Nephi is accepted by some as a 
prophet. About 23–21 b.c.

Behold, now it came to pass that 
when  Nephi  had  spoken  these 
words, certain men who were among 
them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, 
even  there  were  a five  who  went, 
and they said among themselves, as  
they went:

2 Behold, now we will know of a 
surety whether this man be a prophet  
and God hath commanded him to 
prophesy  such  marvelous  things 
unto us. Behold, we do not a believe  
that he hath; yea, we do not believe 
that he is a prophet; nevertheless, 
if this thing which he has said con-
cerning the chief judge be true, that 
he  be  dead,  then  will  we  believe 
that the other words which he has 
spoken are true.

3 And it came to pass that they ran 
in  their  might,  and  came  in  unto 
the judgment-seat; and behold, the 
chief judge had fallen to the earth, 
and did a lie in his blood.

4 And now behold, when they saw 
this they were astonished exceed-
ingly,  insomuch  that  they  fell  to 
the earth; for they had not believed 
the words which Nephi had spoken 
concerning the chief judge.

5 But  now,  when  they  saw  they 
believed, and fear came upon them 
lest all the judgments which Nephi 
had spoken a should come upon the 
people; therefore they did quake, 
and had fallen to the earth.

6 Now,  immediately  when  the 
judge had been murdered—he being 
stabbed by his brother by a garb of 
secrecy, and he fled, and the servants  
ran and told the people, raising the 
cry of murder among them;

7 And behold the people did gather  

themselves together unto the place 
of the judgment-seat—and behold, 
to  their  astonishment  they  saw 
those a five men who had fallen to 
the earth.

8 And  now  behold,  the  people 
knew nothing concerning the mul-
titude who had gathered together 
at the a garden of Nephi; therefore 
they said among themselves: These 
men are they who have murdered 
the judge, and God has smitten them 
that they could not flee from us.

9 And it came to pass that they laid 
hold on them, and bound them and 
cast  them  into  prison.  And  there 
was  a  proclamation  sent  abroad 
that the judge was slain, and that 
the murderers had been taken and 
were cast into prison.

10 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow  the  people  did  assemble 
themselves together to a mourn and 
to  b fast, at the burial of the great 
chief judge who had been slain.

11 And thus also those judges who 
were at the garden of Nephi, and 
heard his words, were also gathered 
together at the burial.

12 And it came to pass that they 
inquired among the people, saying: 
Where are the five who were sent to 
inquire concerning the chief judge 
whether he was dead? And they an-
swered  and  said:  Concerning  this 
five whom ye say ye have sent, we 
know not; but there are five who are 
the murderers, whom we have cast  
into prison.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judges desired that they should be 
brought;  and  they  were  brought, 
and behold they were the five who 
were sent; and behold the judges in-
quired of them to know concerning 
the matter, and they told them all 
that they had done, saying:

14 We ran and came to the place 
of  the  judgment-seat,  and  when 
we  saw  all  things  even  as  Nephi 
had  testified,  we  were  astonished

insomuch that we fell to the earth; 
and when we were recovered from 
our astonishment, behold they cast 
us into a prison.

15 Now, as for the murder of this 
man,  we  know  not  who  has  done 
it;  and  only  this  much  we  know, 
we ran and came a according as ye 
desired, and behold he was dead, 
according to the words of Nephi.

16 And now it came to pass that 
the judges did expound the matter 
unto  the  people,  and  did  cry  out 
against Nephi, saying: Behold, we 
know  that  this  Nephi  must  have 
agreed  with  some  one  to  slay  the 
judge, and then he might declare 
it unto us, that he might convert us 
unto his faith, that he might raise 
himself to be a great man, chosen 
of God, and a prophet.

17 And now behold, we will detect 
this man, and he shall confess his 
fault and make known unto us the 
true murderer of this judge.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
five  were  liberated  on  the  day  of 
the burial. Nevertheless, they did 
rebuke  the  judges  in  the  words 
which  they  had  spoken  against 
Nephi, and did contend with them 
one by one, insomuch that they did 
confound them.

19 Nevertheless, they caused that 
Nephi should be taken and bound 
and brought before the multitude, 
and they began to question him in 
divers ways that they might cross 
him,  that  they  might  accuse  him 
to death—

20 Saying unto him: Thou art con-
federate; who is this man that hath 
done this murder? Now tell us, and 
acknowledge thy fault; saying, Be-
hold  here  is  a money;  and  also  we 
will grant unto thee thy life if thou 
wilt  tell  us,  and  acknowledge  the 
agreement which thou hast made 
with him.

21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye 

a fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye 
blind, and ye b stiffnecked people, 
do ye know how long the Lord your 
God will suffer you that ye shall go 
on in this your way of sin?

22 O  ye  ought  to  begin  to  howl 
and  a mourn, because of the great 
destruction which at this time doth 
await you, except ye shall repent.

23 Behold ye say that I have agreed 
with a man that he should murder 
Seezoram, our chief judge. But be-
hold,  I  say  unto  you,  that  this  is 
because  I  have  testified  unto  you 
that ye might know concerning this 
thing; yea, even for a witness unto 
you, that I did know of the wicked-
ness and abominations which are 
among you.

24 And because I have done this, 
ye  say  that  I  have  agreed  with  a 
man that he should do this thing; 
yea, because I showed unto you this 
sign ye are angry with me, and seek 
to destroy my life.

25 And now behold, I will show 
unto you another sign, and see if 
ye  will  in  this  thing  seek  to  de-
stroy me.

26 Behold  I  say  unto  you:  Go  to 
the house of Seantum, who is the 
a brother of Seezoram, and say unto 
him—

27 Has  Nephi,  the  pretended 
prophet, who doth prophesy so much 
evil concerning this people, agreed 
with  thee,  in  the  which  ye  have 
murdered  Seezoram,  who  is  your  
brother?

28 And behold, he shall say unto 

you, Nay.

29 And ye shall say unto him: Have 

ye murdered your brother?

30 And he shall stand with fear, 
and wist not what to say. And be-
hold, he shall deny unto you; and 
he shall make as if he were aston-
ished; nevertheless, he shall declare 
unto you that he is innocent.

31 But  behold,  ye  shall  examine

him, and ye shall find blood upon 
the skirts of his cloak.

32 And  when  ye  have  seen  this, 
ye shall say: From whence cometh 
this blood? Do we not know that it 
is the blood of your brother?

us the thoughts of our hearts, and 
also  has  told  us  things;  and  even 
he  has  brought  unto  our  knowl-
edge the true murderer of our chief  
judge.

33 And then shall he tremble, and 
shall look pale, even as if death had 
come upon him.

34 And then shall ye say: Because 
of this fear and this paleness which 
has come upon your face, behold, 
we know that thou art guilty.

35 And  then  shall  greater  fear 
come upon him; and then shall he 
confess unto you, and deny no more 
that he has done this murder.

36 And  then  shall  he  say  unto 
you,  that  I,  Nephi,  know  nothing 
concerning the matter save it were 
given unto me by the power of God. 
And then shall ye know that I am 
an honest man, and that I am sent 
unto you from God.

37 And it came to pass that they 
went  and  did,  even  according  as 
Nephi had said unto them. And be-
hold, the words which he had said 
were true; for according to the words 
he did deny; and also according to 
the words he did confess.

38 And he was brought to prove 
that he himself was the very mur-
derer, insomuch that the five were 
set at liberty, and also was Nephi.
39 And  there  were  some  of  the 
Nephites who believed on the words 
of  Nephi;  and  there  were  some 
also, who believed because of the 
testimony of the five, for they had 
been  converted  while  they  were  
in prison.

40 And  now  there  were  some 
among  the  people,  who  said  that 
Nephi was a prophet.

41 And there were others who said: 
Behold, he is a god, for except he 
was  a  god  he  could  not  a know  of 
all things. For behold, he has told 

CHAPTER 10
The  Lord  gives  Nephi  the  sealing 
power—He is empowered to bind and 
loose on earth and in heaven—He com-
mands the people to repent or perish—
The Spirit carries him from multitude 
to multitude. About 21–20 b.c.
And it came to pass that there arose 
a division among the people, inso-
much that they divided hither and 
thither and went their ways, leaving 
Nephi alone, as he was standing in 
the midst of them.

2 And it came to pass that Nephi 
went his way towards his own house, 
a pondering upon the things which 
the Lord had shown unto him.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  as  he  was 
thus pondering—being much cast 
down because of the wickedness of 
the  people  of  the  Nephites,  their 
secret works of darkness, and their 
murderings, and their plunderings, 
and all manner of iniquities—and 
it came to pass as he was thus pon-
dering in his heart, behold, a a voice 
came unto him saying:

4 a Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those 
things  which  thou  hast  done;  for  
I have beheld how thou hast with 
b unwearyingness declared the word,  
which I have given unto thee, unto 
this people. And thou hast not feared 
them,  and  hast  not  sought  thine  
c own life, but hast sought my d will, 
and to keep my commandments.

5 And now, because thou hast done 
this with such unwearyingness, be-
hold, I will bless thee forever; and I 
will make thee mighty in word and 
in deed, in faith and in works; yea, 
even that a all things shall be b done

unto thee according to thy  c word, 
for thou shalt d not ask that which 
is contrary to my will.

6 Behold,  thou  art  Nephi,  and  I 
am God. Behold, I declare it unto 
thee in the presence of mine angels, 
that ye shall have power over this 
people,  and  shall  smite  the  earth 
with a famine, and with pestilence, 
and  destruction,  according  to  the 
wickedness of this people.

7 Behold, I give unto you a power, 
that  whatsoever  ye  shall  b seal  on 
earth  shall  be  sealed  in  heaven; 
and  whatsoever  ye  shall  loose  on 
earth shall be loosed in heaven; and 
thus  shall  ye  have  power  among 
this people.

8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this 
temple it shall be rent in twain, it 
shall be done.

9 And  if  ye  shall  say  unto  this 
a mountain, Be thou cast down and 
become smooth, it shall be done.

10 And behold, if ye shall say that 
God shall smite this people, it shall 
come to pass.

11 And  now  behold,  I  command 
you,  that  ye  shall  go  and  declare 
unto this people, that thus saith the 
Lord God, who is the Almighty: Ex-
cept ye repent ye shall be smitten, 
even unto a destruction.

12 And  behold,  now  it  came  to 
pass that when the Lord had spoken 
these words unto Nephi, he did stop 
and did not go unto his own house, 
but did return unto the multitudes 
who  were  scattered  about  upon 
the face of the land, and began to 
declare unto them the word of the 
Lord which had been spoken unto 
him, concerning their destruction 
if they did not repent.

13 Now behold, a notwithstanding 
that  great  miracle  which  Nephi 
had done in telling them concern-
ing  the  death  of  the  chief  judge, 

they  did  harden  their  hearts  and 
did not hearken unto the words of  
the Lord.

14 Therefore  Nephi  did  declare 
unto  them  the  word  of  the  Lord, 
saying: Except ye repent, thus saith 
the Lord, ye shall be a smitten even 
unto destruction.

15 And it came to pass that when 
Nephi had declared unto them the 
word, behold, they did still harden 
their hearts and would not hearken 
unto his words; therefore they did 
a revile against him, and did seek to 
lay their hands upon him that they 
might cast him into prison.

16 But behold, the power of God 
was with him, and they could not 
take  him  to  cast  him  into  prison, 
for he was taken by the Spirit and 
a conveyed  away  out  of  the  midst 
of them.

17 And it came to pass that thus 
he did go forth in the Spirit, from 
multitude to multitude, declaring 
the word of God, even until he had 
declared it unto them all, or sent it 
forth among all the people.

18 And it came to pass that they 
would not hearken unto his words; 
and there began to be contentions, 
insomuch that they were divided 
against  themselves  and  began  to 
slay one another with the sword.

19 And thus ended the seventy and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

HELAMAN 11  : 1–15

And now it came to pass in the sev-
enty and second year of the reign 
of the judges that the contentions 
did increase, insomuch that there 
were wars throughout all the land 
among all the people of Nephi.

2 And it was this a secret band of 
robbers who did carry on this work 
of destruction and wickedness. And 
this war did last all that year; and 
in the seventy and third year it did 
also last.

3 And it came to pass that in this 
year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, 
saying:

4 O Lord, do not suffer that this 
people  shall  be  destroyed  by  the 
sword; but O Lord, rather a let there 
be  a  b famine  in  the  land,  to  stir 
them  up  in  remembrance  of  the 
Lord their God, and perhaps they 
will repent and turn unto thee.

5 And  so  it  was  done,  according 
to the words of Nephi. And there 
was a great famine upon the land, 
among all the people of Nephi. And 
thus in the seventy and fourth year 
the famine did continue, and the 
work of destruction did cease by the 
sword but became sore by famine.
6 And this work of destruction did 
also  continue  in  the  seventy  and 
fifth year. For the earth was smitten 
that it was a dry, and did not yield 
forth grain in the season of grain; 
and the whole earth was smitten, 
even among the Lamanites as well 
as among the Nephites, so that they 
were smitten that they did perish 
by thousands in the more wicked 
parts of the land.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people saw that they were about to 
perish by famine, and they began 
to  a remember the Lord their God; 
and  they  began  to  remember  the 
words of Nephi.

8 And the people a began to plead 
with  their  chief  judges  and  their 

leaders, that they would say unto 
Nephi: Behold, we know that thou 
art  a  man  of  God,  and  therefore 
cry unto the Lord our God that he 
turn away from us this famine, lest 
all the words which thou hast spo-
ken  concerning  our  b destruction 
be fulfilled.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judges did say unto Nephi, accord-
ing to the words which had been 
desired.  And  it  came  to  pass  that 
when  Nephi  saw  that  the  people 
had  a repented  and  did  humble 
themselves  in  sackcloth,  he  cried 
again unto the Lord, saying:

10 O Lord, behold this people re-
penteth; and they have swept away 
the band of Gadianton from amongst 
them insomuch that they have be-
come  extinct,  and  they  have  con-
cealed their secret plans in the earth.
11 Now,  O  Lord,  because  of  this 
their humility wilt thou turn away 
thine  anger,  and  let  thine  anger 
be appeased in the destruction of 
those wicked men whom thou hast 
already destroyed.

12 O  Lord,  wilt  thou  turn  away 
thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and  
cause that this famine may cease in  
this land.

13 O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto 
me, and cause that it may be done ac-
cording to my words, and send forth  
a rain  upon  the  face  of  the  earth, 
that she may bring forth her fruit, 
and her grain in the season of grain.
14 O Lord, thou didst hearken unto 
a my words when I said, Let there 
be a famine, that the pestilence of 
the sword might cease; and I know 
that  thou  wilt,  even  at  this  time, 
hearken unto my words, for thou 
saidst that: If this people repent I 
will spare them.

15 Yea,  O  Lord,  and  thou  seest 
that they have repented, because of 
the famine and the pestilence and

destruction which has come unto 
them.

16 And  now,  O  Lord,  wilt  thou 
turn  away  thine  anger,  and  try 
again if they will serve thee? And 
if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them 
according to thy words which thou 
hast said.

17 And it came to pass that in the 
seventy and sixth year the Lord did 
turn away his anger from the peo-
ple,  and  caused  that  a rain  should 
fall upon the earth, insomuch that 
it did bring forth her fruit in the 
season of her fruit. And it came to 
pass that it did bring forth her grain 
in the season of her grain.

18 And behold, the people did re-
joice and glorify God, and the whole 
face of the land was filled with re-
joicing; and they did no more seek to 
destroy Nephi, but they did esteem 
him as a a great prophet, and a man 
of God, having great power and au-
thority given unto him from God.
19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, 
was not a  a whit behind him as to 
things pertaining to righteousness.
20 And  thus  it  did  come  to  pass 
that the people of Nephi began to 
prosper again in the land, and be-
gan to build up their waste places, 
and began to multiply and spread, 
even until they did a cover the whole 
face of the land, both on the north-
ward and on the southward, from 
the sea west to the sea east.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
seventy and sixth year did end in 
peace. And the seventy and seventh  
year began in peace; and the a church 
did spread throughout the face of all 
the land; and the more part of the 
people, both the Nephites and the  
Lamanites, did belong to the church; 
and they did have exceedingly great 
peace in the land; and thus ended 
the seventy and seventh year.

22 And also they had peace in the 

seventy and eighth year, save it were 
a few contentions concerning the 
points of doctrine which had been 
laid down by the prophets.

23 And in the seventy and ninth 
year there began to be much strife. 
But it came to pass that Nephi and 
Lehi, and many of their brethren 
who  knew  concerning  the  true 
points  of  doctrine,  having  many 
a revelations  daily,  therefore  they 
did preach unto the people, inso-
much that they did put an end to 
their strife in that same year.

24 And it came to pass that in the 
eightieth  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges  over  the  people  of  Nephi, 
there were a certain number of the 
dissenters from the people of Nephi, 
who  had  some  years  before  gone  
over unto the Lamanites, and taken 
upon  themselves  the  name  of  La-
manites, and also a certain number 
who were real descendants of the 
Lamanites, being stirred up to anger  
by  them,  or  by  those  dissenters, 
therefore they commenced a a war 
with their brethren.

25 And they did commit murder 
and plunder; and then they would 
retreat  back  into  the  mountains, 
and into the wilderness and secret 
places, hiding themselves that they 
could not be discovered, receiving 
daily an addition to their numbers, 
inasmuch as there were dissenters 
that went forth unto them.

26 And thus in time, yea, even in 
the space of a not many years, they 
became an exceedingly great band 
of robbers; and they did search out 
all the b secret plans of Gadianton; 
and  thus  they  became  robbers  of 
Gadianton.

27 Now behold, these robbers did 
make great havoc, yea, even great 
destruction  among  the  people  of 
Nephi, and also among the people 
of the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that it was 
expedient  that  there  should  be  a 
stop  put  to  this  work  of  destruc-
tion; therefore they sent an army 
of strong men into the wilderness 
and upon the mountains to search 
out  this  band  of  robbers,  and  to 
destroy them.

29 But behold, it came to pass that 
in that same year they were driven 
back  even  into  their  own  lands. 
And thus ended the eightieth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement of the eighty and 
first year they did go forth again 
against  this  band  of  robbers,  and 
did  destroy  many;  and  they  were 
also visited with much destruction.
31 And they were again obliged to 
return out of the wilderness and out 
of the a mountains unto their own 
lands,  because  of  the  exceeding 
greatness of the numbers of those 
robbers who infested the mountains 
and the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that thus 
ended  this  year.  And  the  robbers 
did still increase and wax strong, 
insomuch  that  they  did  defy  the 
whole armies of the Nephites, and 
also of the Lamanites; and they did 
cause great fear to come unto the 
people upon all the face of the land.
33 Yea,  for  they  did  visit  many 
parts of the land, and did do great 
destruction unto them; yea, did kill 
many,  and  did  carry  away  others 
captive  into  the  wilderness,  yea, 
and more especially their women 
and their children.

34 Now this great evil, which came 
unto  the  people  because  of  their 
iniquity, did stir them up again in 
a remembrance of the Lord their God.
35 And thus ended the eighty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.

36 And in the eighty and second 
year they began again to a forget the 
Lord their God. And in the eighty 
and third year they began to wax 
strong in iniquity. And in the eighty 
and fourth year they did not mend 
their ways.

37 And it came to pass in the eighty 
and fifth year they did wax stron-
ger and stronger in their pride, and 
in their wickedness; and thus they  
were a ripening again for destruction.
38 And thus ended the eighty and 

fifth year.

CHAPTER 12

Men  are  unstable  and  foolish  and 
quick  to  do  evil—The  Lord  chastens 
His people—The nothingness of men is 
compared with the power of God—In 
the day of judgment, men will gain ev-
erlasting life or everlasting damnation. 
About 6 b.c.

And thus we can behold how false, 
and  also  the  unsteadiness  of  the 
hearts of the children of men; yea, 
we  can  see  that  the  Lord  in  his 
great infinite goodness doth bless 
and  a prosper those who put their 
b trust in him.

2 Yea, and we may see at the very 
a time  when  he  doth  b prosper  his 
people, yea, in the increase of their 
fields, their flocks and their herds, 
and in gold, and in silver, and in all 
manner of c precious things of every 
kind  and  art;  sparing  their  lives,  
and  delivering  them  out  of  the 
hands of their enemies; softening 
the hearts of their enemies that they 
should  not  declare  wars  against 
them;  yea,  and  in  fine,  doing  all 
things for the welfare and happiness 
of his people; yea, then is the time 
that they do  d harden their hearts, 
and do e forget the Lord their God, 
and do f  trample under their feet the

Holy One—yea, and this because of 
their  ease,  and  their  exceedingly 
great prosperity.

3 And thus we see that except the 
Lord doth a chasten his people with 
many afflictions, yea, except he doth 
visit them with b death and with ter-
ror, and with famine and with all 
manner of pestilence, they will not  
c remember him.

4 O  how  a foolish,  and  how  vain, 
and how evil, and devilish, and how 
b quick to do iniquity, and how slow 
to do good, are the children of men; 
yea, how quick to hearken unto the 
words  of  the  evil  one,  and  to  set 
their c hearts upon the vain things of  
the world!

5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up 
in a pride; yea, how quick to b boast, 
and do all manner of that which is 
iniquity; and how slow are they to 
remember the Lord their God, and 
to give ear unto his counsels, yea, 
how slow to c walk in wisdom’s paths!
6 Behold, they do not desire that 
the Lord their God, who hath a cre-
ated them, should b rule and reign 
over  them;  notwithstanding  his 
great  goodness  and  his  mercy  to-
wards them, they do set at c naught 
his counsels, and they will not that 
he should be their guide.

7 O how great is the a nothingness of 
the children of men; yea, even they  
are b less than the dust of the earth.
8 For behold, the dust of the earth 
moveth hither and thither, to the 
dividing asunder, at the command 
of our great and everlasting God.

9 Yea, behold at his a voice do the 

hills  and  the  mountains  tremble 
and b quake.

10 And by the a power of his voice 
they  are  broken  up,  and  become 
smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.
11 Yea, by the power of his voice 

doth the a whole earth shake;

12 Yea, by the power of his voice, 
do  the  foundations  rock,  even  to 
the very center.

13 Yea,  and  if  he  say  unto  the 

earth—Move—it is moved.

14 Yea, if he say unto the a earth—
Thou shalt b go back, that it c lengthen 
out the day for many hours—it is 
done;

15 And  thus,  according  to  his 
word the a earth goeth back, and it 
appeareth unto man that the b sun 
standeth still; yea, and behold, this 
is so; for surely it is the earth that 
moveth and not the sun.

16 And behold, also, if he say unto 
the a waters of the great deep—b Be 
thou dried up—it is done.

17 Behold,  if  he  say  unto  this 
mountain—Be thou raised up, and 
a come over and fall upon that city, 
that it be buried up—behold it is 
done.

18 And behold, if a man a hide up a 
treasure in the earth, and the Lord 
shall say—Let it be  b accursed, be-
cause  of the  iniquity  of him  who 
hath hid it up—behold, it shall be 
accursed.

19 And if the Lord shall say—Be 
thou  accursed,  that  no  man  shall 
find thee from this time henceforth 
and forever—behold, no man getteth 
it henceforth and forever.

20 And behold, if the Lord shall 
say unto a man—Because of thine 
iniquities,  thou shalt  be  accursed 
a forever—it shall be done.

21 And if the Lord shall say—Be-
cause of thine iniquities thou shalt 
be a cut off from my presence—he 
will cause that it shall be so.

22 And wo unto him to whom he 
shall say this, for it shall be unto 
him that will do iniquity, and he 
cannot be a saved; therefore, for this 
cause, that men might be saved, hath 
repentance been declared.

23 Therefore, blessed are they who  
will repent and hearken unto the 
voice of the Lord their God; for these  
are they that shall be saved.

24 And may God grant, in his great  
fulness, that men might be brought 
unto repentance and good works, that 
they might be restored unto grace  
for a grace, according to their works.
25 And I would that all men might 
be saved. But we read that in the 
a great and last day there are some 
who shall be cast out, yea, who shall  
be  cast  off  from  the  b presence  of 
the Lord;

26 Yea, who shall be consigned to 
a state of endless misery, fulfilling 
the words which say: They that have 
done good shall have  a everlasting 
life; and they that have done evil 
shall have everlasting b damnation. 
And thus it is. Amen.

The  prophecy  of  S amuel,  the  
Lamanite, to the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 13 through 15.

CHAPTER 13

Samuel  the  Lamanite  prophesies  the 
destruction  of  the  Nephites  unless 

they  repent—They  and  their  riches 
are cursed—They reject and stone the 
prophets,  are  encircled  about  by  de-
mons, and seek for happiness in doing 
iniquity. About 6 b.c.

And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
eighty and sixth year, the Nephites  
did still remain in wickedness, yea, 
in great wickedness, while the a La-
manites did observe strictly to keep 
the commandments of God, accord-
ing to the law of Moses.

2 And it came to pass that in this  
year there was one a Samuel, a b La-
manite, came into the land of Zara-
hemla, and began to preach unto the  
people. And it came to pass that he 
did preach, many days, repentance 
unto the people, and they did c cast 
him out, and he was about to d return  
to his own land.

3 But behold, the a voice of the Lord 
came unto him, that he should re-
turn again, and prophesy unto the 
people  whatsoever  things  should 
come into his b heart.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
would not suffer that he should en-
ter into the city; therefore he went 
and got upon the a wall thereof, and 
stretched forth his hand and cried 
with a loud voice, and b prophesied 
unto the people whatsoever things 
the Lord put into his heart.

5 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the 
words of the Lord which he doth put  
into my heart; and behold he hath 
put it into my heart to say unto this 
people  that  the  a sword  of  justice 
hangeth over this people; and four 
hundred years pass not away save 
the  sword  of  justice  falleth  upon 
this people.

this  people,  and  it  surely  cometh 
unto this people, and nothing can 
save this people save it be repentance  
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, 
who  surely  shall  come  into  the 
world, and shall suffer many things 
and shall be slain for his people.

7 And behold, an a angel of the Lord 
hath declared it unto me, and he 
did bring b glad tidings to my soul. 
And  behold,  I  was  sent  unto  you 
to declare it unto you also, that ye 
might have glad tidings; but behold 
ye would c not receive me.

8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: 
Because  of  the  hardness  of  the 
hearts of the people of the Neph-
ites, except they repent I will take 
away my word from them, and I will 
a withdraw my Spirit from them, and 
I will suffer them no longer, and I 
will turn the hearts of their brethren  
against them.

9 And  a four hundred years shall 
not pass away before I will cause 
that  they  shall  be  smitten;  yea,  I 
will visit them with the sword and 
with famine and with pestilence.

10 Yea,  I  will  visit  them  in  my 
fierce  anger,  and  there  shall  be 
those  of  the  a fourth  generation 
who shall live, of your enemies, to 
behold your utter destruction; and 
this shall surely come except ye re-
pent, saith the Lord; and those of the 
fourth generation shall visit your  
destruction.

11 But if ye will repent and a return 
unto the Lord your God I will turn 
away  mine  anger,  saith  the  Lord; 
yea,  thus  saith  the  Lord,  blessed 
are they who will repent and turn 
unto me, but wo unto him that re-
penteth not.

12 Yea, a wo unto this great city of 
Zarahemla; for behold, it is because 
of those who are righteous that it 

is  saved;  yea,  wo  unto  this  great 
city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, 
that there are many, yea, even the 
more  part  of  this  great  city,  that 
will  harden  their  hearts  against 
me, saith the Lord.

13 But blessed are they who will 
repent, for them will I spare. But 
behold, if it were not for the righ-
teous who are in this great city, be-
hold, I would cause that a fire should 
come  down  out  of  heaven  and  
b destroy it.

14 But behold, it is for the righ-
teous’  sake  that  it  is  spared.  But 
behold, the time cometh, saith the 
Lord,  that  when  ye  shall  cast  out 
the righteous from among you, then 
shall ye be a ripe for destruction; yea, 
wo be unto this great city, because 
of the wickedness and abominations 
which are in her.

15 Yea,  and  wo  be  unto  the  city 
of Gideon, for the wickedness and 
abominations which are in her.

16 Yea,  and  wo  be  unto  all  the 
cities which are in the land round 
about, which are possessed by the 
Nephites,  because  of  the  wicked-
ness and abominations which are  
in them.

17 And  behold,  a  a curse  shall 
come upon the land, saith the Lord 
of  Hosts,  because  of  the  people’s 
sake  who  are  upon  the  land,  yea, 
because  of  their  wickedness  and 
their abominations.

18 And it shall come to pass, saith 
the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and 
true  God,  that  whoso  shall  a hide 
up treasures in the earth shall find 
them again no more, because of the 
great curse of the land, save he be 
a righteous man and shall hide it 
up unto the Lord.

19 For I will, saith the Lord, that 
they shall hide up their a treasures

unto me; and cursed be they who 
hide not up their treasures unto me; 
for none hideth up their treasures 
unto me save it be the righteous; and 
he that hideth not up his treasures 
unto me, cursed is he, and also the 
treasure, and none shall redeem it 
because of the curse of the land.

20 And  the  day  shall  come  that 
they shall hide up their treasures, 
because they have set their hearts 
upon riches; and because they have 
set their hearts upon their riches, 
and  will  hide  up  their  treasures 
when  they  shall  flee  before  their 
enemies;  because  they  will  not 
hide them up unto me, cursed be 
they and also their treasures; and 
in that day shall they be smitten, 
saith the Lord.

21 Behold  ye,  the  people  of  this 
great  city,  and  hearken  unto  my 
words; yea, hearken unto the words 
which the Lord saith; for behold, he 
saith  that  ye  are  a cursed  because 
of  your  riches,  and  also  are  your 
riches cursed because ye have set 
your hearts upon them, and have 
not b hearkened unto the words of 
him who gave them unto you.

22 Ye do not remember the Lord 
your God in the things with which 
he hath blessed you, but ye do al-
ways remember your a riches, not to 
thank the Lord your God for them; 
yea, your hearts are not drawn out 
unto  the  Lord,  but  they  do  swell 
with  great  pride,  unto  b boasting, 
and  unto  great  c swelling,  d envy-
ings, strifes, malice, persecutions, 
and  murders,  and  all  manner  of  
iniquities.

23 For  this  cause  hath  the  Lord 
God caused that a curse should come 
upon the land, and also upon your 

riches,  and  this  because  of  your  
iniquities.

24 Yea,  wo  unto  this  people,  be-
cause of this time which has arrived, 
that ye do  a cast out the prophets, 
and do mock them, and cast stones 
at them, and do slay them, and do 
all manner of iniquity unto them, 
even as they did of old time.

25 And now when ye talk, ye say: 
If our days had been in the days of 
our  a fathers  of  old,  we  would  not 
have b slain the prophets; we would 
not  have  stoned  them,  and  cast  
them out.

26 Behold ye are worse than they; 
for as the Lord liveth, if a a prophet 
come among you and declareth unto 
you the word of the Lord, which tes-
tifieth of your b sins and iniquities, 
ye are c angry with him, and cast him 
out and seek all manner of ways to 
destroy him; yea, you will say that 
he is a d false e prophet, and that he 
is  a  sinner,  and  of  the  devil,  be-
cause he f testifieth that your deeds  
are evil.

27 But behold, if a man shall come 
among you and shall say: Do this, 
and there is no iniquity; do that and 
ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: 
a Walk after the pride of your own 
hearts; yea, walk after the pride of 
your eyes, and do whatsoever your 
heart desireth—and if a man shall 
come among you and say this, ye 
will  receive  him,  and  say  that  he 
is a b prophet.

28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye 
will give unto him of your substance; 
ye will give unto him of your gold, 
and of your silver, and ye will clothe 
him  with  costly  apparel;  and  be-
cause he speaketh a flattering words 
unto  you,  and  he  saith  that  all  is

well,  then  ye  will  not  find  fault 
with him.

29 O  ye  wicked  and  ye  perverse 
generation;  ye  hardened  and  ye 
a stiffnecked people, how long will ye 
suppose that the Lord will suffer you? 
Yea, how long will ye suffer your-
selves to be led by b foolish and c blind  
guides? Yea, how long will ye d choose  
darkness rather than e light?

30 Yea,  behold,  the  anger  of  the 
Lord is already kindled against you; 
behold, he hath cursed the land be-
cause of your iniquity.

31 And behold, the time cometh 
that  he  curseth  your  riches,  that 
they become a slippery, that ye can-
not hold them; and in the days of 
your poverty ye cannot retain them.
32 And in the days of your poverty 
ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in 
vain shall ye cry, for your desolation 
is already come upon you, and your 
destruction is made sure; and then 
shall ye weep and howl in that day, 
saith the Lord of Hosts. And then 
shall ye lament, and say:

33 O  a that  I  had  repented,  and 
had  not  killed  the  prophets,  and 
b stoned  them,  and  cast  them  out. 
Yea,  in  that  day  ye  shall  say:  O 
that we had remembered the Lord 
our God in the day that he gave us 
our  riches,  and  then  they  would 
not have become slippery that we 
should lose them; for behold, our 
riches are gone from us.

34 Behold, we lay a tool here and 
on the morrow it is gone; and be-
hold, our swords are taken from us  
in the day we have sought them for  
battle.

35 Yea, we have hid up our a trea-
sures and they have slipped away 
from  us,  because  of  the  curse  of 
the land.

36 O that we had repented in the  

day that the word of the Lord came 
unto  us;  for  behold  the  land  is 
cursed, and all things are become 
slippery, and we cannot hold them.
37 Behold, we are surrounded by  
a demons, yea, we are encircled about 
by  the  angels  of  him  who  hath  
sought to destroy our souls. Behold, 
our  iniquities  are  great.  O  Lord, 
canst thou not turn away thine an-
ger from us? And this shall be your 
language in those days.

38 But behold, your a days of pro-
bation are past; ye have  b procras-
tinated  the  day  of  your  salvation 
until it is everlastingly too late, and 
your destruction is made sure; yea, 
for ye have sought all the days of 
your lives for that which ye could 
not obtain; and ye have sought for 
c happiness in doing iniquity, which 
thing is d contrary to the nature of 
that righteousness which is in our 
great and Eternal Head.

39 O  ye  people  of  the  land,  that 
ye  would  hear  my  words!  And  I 
pray that the anger of the Lord be 
turned away from you, and that ye 
would repent and be saved.

CHAPTER 14

Samuel predicts light during the night 
and a new star at Christ’s birth—Christ 
redeems men from temporal and spir-
itual  death—The  signs  of  His  death 
include three days of darkness, the rend-
ing of the rocks, and great upheavals 
of nature. About 6 b.c.
And now it came to pass that a Sam-
uel,  the  Lamanite,  did  prophesy 
a  great  many  more  things  which 
cannot be written.

2 And behold, he said unto them:

to redeem all those who shall be-
lieve on his name.

3 And behold, this will I give unto 
you  for  a  a sign  at  the  time  of  his 
coming; for behold, there shall be 
great  lights  in  heaven,  insomuch 
that in the night before he cometh 
there shall be no darkness, insomuch 
that it shall appear unto man as if 
it was day.

4 Therefore,  there  shall  be  one 
a day  and  a  night  and  a  day,  as  if 
it were one day and there were no 
night;  and  this  shall  be  unto  you 
for a sign; for ye shall know of the 
rising of the sun and also of its set-
ting; therefore they shall know of a 
surety that there shall be two days 
and a night; nevertheless the night 
shall not be darkened; and it shall 
be the night before he is b born.

5 And  behold,  there  shall  a  new 
a star arise, such an one as ye never 
have beheld; and this also shall be 
a sign unto you.

6 And behold this is not all, there 
shall be many a signs and wonders 
in heaven.

7 And it shall come to pass that ye  
shall all be amazed, and wonder, inso-
much that ye shall a fall to the earth.
8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
whosoever shall a believe on the Son  
of God, the same shall have ever-
lasting life.

9 And behold, thus hath the Lord 
commanded me, by his angel, that 
I  should  come  and  tell  this  thing 
unto you; yea, he hath commanded 
that I should prophesy these things 
unto  you;  yea,  he  hath  said  unto 
me:  Cry  unto  this  people,  repent 
and prepare the way of the Lord.

10 And  now,  because  I  am  a  La-
manite, and have spoken unto you 
the  words  which  the  Lord  hath 
commanded me, and because it was 
hard against you, ye are angry with 
me and do seek to destroy me, and 
have a cast me out from among you.
11 And ye shall  a hear my words, 
for, for this intent have I come up 
upon the walls of this city, that ye 
might hear and know of the judg-
ments of God which do await you 
because of your iniquities, and also 
that ye might know the conditions 
of repentance;

12 And also that ye might know of 
the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of God, the a Father of heaven and of 
earth, the Creator of all things from 
the beginning; and that ye might 
know  of  the  signs  of  his  coming, 
to the intent that ye might believe 
on his name.

13 And if ye a believe on his name 
ye will repent of all your sins, that 
thereby ye may have a remission of 
them through his b merits.

14 And  behold,  again,  another 
sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of 
his a death.

15 For  behold,  he  surely  must 
die that a salvation may come; yea, 
it  behooveth  him  and  becometh  
expedient that he b dieth, to bring to 
pass the c resurrection of the dead, 
that thereby men may be brought 
into the d presence of the Lord.

16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth 
to pass the  a resurrection, and  b re-
deemeth all mankind from the first 
death—that spiritual death; for all 
mankind, by the c fall of Adam be-
ing  d cut  off  from  the  presence  of

the Lord, are considered as e dead, 
both as to things temporal and to 
things spiritual.

17 But behold, the resurrection of 
Christ  a redeemeth  mankind,  yea, 
even  all  mankind,  and  bringeth 
them back into the presence of the  
Lord.

18 Yea,  and  it  bringeth  to  pass 
the  condition  of  repentance,  that 
whosoever  repenteth  the  same  is 
not a hewn down and cast into the 
fire; but whosoever repenteth not is 
hewn down and cast into the fire; 
and there cometh upon them again 
a  b spiritual  death,  yea,  a  second 
death, for they are cut off again as to 
things pertaining to righteousness.
19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, 
lest  by  knowing  these  things  and 
not doing them ye shall suffer your-
selves to come under condemnation, 
and ye are brought down unto this 
second death.

20 But behold, as I said unto you 
concerning another a sign, a sign of 
his death, behold, in that day that 
he shall suffer death the sun shall 
be darkened and refuse to give his 
b light unto you; and also the moon 
and the stars; and there shall be no 
light upon the face of this land, even 
from the time that he shall suffer 
death, for the space of c three days, 
to the time that he shall rise again 
from the dead.

21 Yea,  at  the  time  that  he  shall 
yield up the  a ghost there shall be 
b thunderings and lightnings for the 
space of many hours, and the earth 
shall  shake  and  tremble;  and  the 
c rocks which are upon the face of 
this earth, which are both above the 
earth and beneath, which ye know  
at this time are solid, or the more 

part of it is one solid mass, shall be 
d broken up;

22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain, 
and  shall  ever  after  be  a found  in 
seams  and  in  cracks,  and  in  bro-
ken fragments upon the face of the 
whole  earth,  yea,  both  above  the 
earth and beneath.

23 And  behold,  there  shall  be 
great a tempests, and there shall be 
many mountains laid low, like unto 
a valley, and there shall be many 
places which are now called  b val-
leys which shall become mountains, 
whose height is great.

24 And a many highways shall be 
broken  up,  and  many  cities  shall 
become desolate.

25 And  many  a graves  shall  be 
opened, and shall yield up many of 
their dead; and many saints shall 
appear unto many.

26 And behold, thus hath the a an-
gel spoken unto me; for he said unto 
me that there should be thunder-
ings  and  lightnings  for  the  space 
of many hours.

27 And he said unto me that while 
the  thunder  and  the  lightning 
lasted, and the tempest, that these 
things should be, and that a darkness 
should cover the face of the whole 
earth for the space of three days.

28 And  the  angel  said  unto  me 
that many shall see greater things 
than these, to the intent that they 
might believe that a these signs and 
these wonders should come to pass 
upon  all  the  face  of  this  land,  to 
the intent that there should be no 
cause for unbelief among the chil-
dren of men—

soever will believe might be saved, 
and that whosoever will not believe,

a a righteous judgment might come 
upon them; and also if they are con-
demned they bring upon themselves 
their own condemnation.

30 And now remember, remember, 
my brethren, that whosoever perish-
eth,  perisheth  unto  a himself;  and 
whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it  
unto himself; for behold, ye are b free; 
ye  are  permitted  to  act  for  your-

unto you a c knowledge and he hath  
made you free.

31 He hath given unto you that ye 
might a know good from evil, and he 
hath given unto you that ye might 
b choose  life  or  death;  and  ye  can 
do good and be c restored unto that 
which is good, or have that which is  
good restored unto you; or ye can 
do evil, and have that which is evil 
restored unto you.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord chastened the Nephites because 
He loved them—Converted Lamanites 
are firm and steadfast in the faith—The 
Lord will be merciful unto the Lamanites 
in the latter days. About 6 b.c.

And now, my beloved brethren, be-
hold, I declare unto you that except 
ye  shall  repent  your  houses  shall  
be left unto you a desolate.

2 Yea, except ye repent, your women  
shall have great cause to mourn in 
the day that they shall give suck; for 
ye shall attempt to flee and there 
shall be no place for  a refuge; yea, 
and wo unto them which are b with 
child, for they shall be heavy and 
cannot  flee;  therefore,  they  shall 
be trodden down and shall be left 
to perish.

3 Yea, wo unto this  a people who 

are called the b people of Nephi ex-
cept they shall repent, when they 
shall see all these signs and wonders 
which shall be showed unto them;  
for behold, they have been a chosen  
people of the Lord; yea, the people 
of  Nephi  hath  he  loved,  and  also 
hath  he  c chastened  them;  yea,  in 
the days of their iniquities hath he 
chastened them because he loveth 
them.

4 But  behold  my  brethren,  the  
a Lamanites hath he hated because 
their deeds have been evil continu-
ally, and this because of the iniquity 
of  the  b tradition  of  their  fathers. 
But  behold,  salvation  hath  come 
unto them through the preaching 
of  the  Nephites;  and  for  this  in-
tent hath the Lord c prolonged their  
days.

5 And I would that ye should be-
hold  that  the  a more  part  of  them 
are in the path of their duty, and 
they do walk circumspectly before 
God, and they do observe to keep 
his commandments and his statutes 
and his judgments according to the 
law of Moses.

6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more 
part  of  them  are  doing  this,  and 
they are striving with a unwearied 
diligence that they may bring the 
remainder of their brethren to the 
knowledge of the truth; therefore 
there are many who do add to their 
numbers daily.

7 And behold, ye do know of your-
selves, for ye have witnessed it, that 
as many of them as are brought to 
the knowledge of the truth, and to 
know of the wicked and abominable 
traditions of their fathers, and are 
led to believe the holy scriptures, 
yea,  the  prophecies  of  the  holy

leadeth them to faith on the Lord, 
and unto repentance, which faith 
and repentance bringeth a a change 
of heart unto them—

8 Therefore, as many as have come 
to this, ye know of yourselves are 
a firm and steadfast in the faith, and 
in the thing wherewith they have 
been made free.

9 And ye know also that they have 
a buried their weapons of war, and 
they fear to take them up lest by 
any means they should sin; yea, ye 
can  see  that  they  fear  to  sin—for 
behold they will suffer themselves 
that they be trodden down and slain 
by their enemies, and will not lift 
their swords against them, and this 
because of their b faith in Christ.

10 And  now,  because  of  their 
a steadfastness when they do believe 
in that thing which they do believe, 
for because of their firmness when 
they are once enlightened, behold, 
the Lord shall bless them and pro-
long  their  days,  notwithstanding 
their iniquity—

11 Yea, even if they should dwindle 
in unbelief the Lord shall a prolong 
their days, until the time shall come 
which hath been spoken of by our 
fathers,  and  also  by  the  prophet 
b Zenos, and many other prophets, 
concerning the c restoration of our 
brethren, the Lamanites, again to 
the knowledge of the truth—

12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the 
latter  times  the  a promises  of  the 
Lord  have  been  extended  to  our 
brethren, the Lamanites; and not-
withstanding the many afflictions 
which they shall have, and notwith-
standing  they  shall  be  b driven  to 
and fro upon the face of the earth, 
and be hunted, and shall be smit-
ten and scattered abroad, having no 

place for c refuge, the Lord shall be 
d merciful unto them.

13 And  this  is  according  to  the 
prophecy, that they shall again be 
a brought  to  the  true  knowledge, 
which  is  the  knowledge  of  their 
Redeemer, and their great and true 
b shepherd, and be numbered among 
his c sheep.

14 Therefore  I  say  unto  you,  it 
shall be  a better for them than for 
you except ye repent.

15 For  behold,  a had  the  mighty 
works been shown unto them which 
have  been  shown  unto  you,  yea, 
unto them who have dwindled in 
unbelief because of the traditions 
of their fathers, ye can see of your-
selves that they never would again 
have dwindled in unbelief.

16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will  
not  utterly  destroy  them,  but  I  
will  cause  that  in  the  day  of  my 
wis dom  they  shall  a return  again 
unto me, saith the Lord.

17 And  now  behold,  saith  the 
Lord, concerning the people of the 
Nephites:  If  they  will  not  repent, 
and observe to do my will, I will ut-
terly a destroy them, saith the Lord, 
because of their unbelief notwith-
standing  the  many  mighty  works 
which  I  have  done  among  them; 
and  as  surely  as  the  Lord  liveth 
shall these things be, saith the Lord.

HELAMAN 16  : 1–15

And now, it came to pass that there 
were  many  who  heard  the  words 
of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he 
spake upon the  a walls of the city. 
And as many as believed on his word 
went  forth  and  sought  for  Nephi; 
and when they had come forth and 
found him they confessed unto him 
their sins and denied not, desiring 
that they might be b baptized unto 
the Lord.

2 But as many as there were who 
did not believe in the words of Sam-
uel were a angry with him; and they 
cast stones at him upon the wall, 
and also many shot arrows at him 
as he stood upon the wall; but the 
Spirit  of  the  Lord  was  with  him, 
insomuch  that  they  could  not  hit 
him with their stones neither with 
their arrows.

3 Now  when  they  saw  that  they 
could not hit him, there were many 
more who did believe on his words, 
insomuch that they went away unto 
Nephi to be baptized.

4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, 
and  prophesying,  and  preaching, 
crying repentance unto the people, 
showing signs and wonders, working 
a miracles  among  the  people,  that 
they  might  know  that  the  Christ 
must b shortly come—

5 Telling  them  of  things  which 
must shortly come, that they might 
know and remember at the time of 
their  coming  that  they  had  been 
made known unto them beforehand, 
to the intent that they might believe; 
therefore as many as believed on the 
words  of  Samuel  went  forth  unto 
him to be baptized, for they came 
repenting and confessing their sins.
6 But the a more part of them did 
not believe in the words of Samuel; 
therefore when they saw that they 
could not hit him with their stones 
and their arrows, they cried unto 
their  captains,  saying:  b Take  this 
fellow  and  bind  him,  for  behold 

he c hath a devil; and because of the 
power of the devil which is in him 
we cannot hit him with our stones 
and our arrows; therefore take him 
and bind him, and away with him.
7 And  as  they  went  forth  to  lay 
their hands on him, behold, he did 
cast  himself  down  from  the  wall, 
and did flee out of their lands, yea, 
even  unto  his  own  country,  and 
began  to  preach  and  to  prophesy 
a among his own people.

8 And behold, he was never heard 
of more among the Nephites; and 
thus were the affairs of the people.
9 And thus ended the eighty and 
sixth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

10 And thus ended also the eighty 
and seventh year of the reign of the 
judges, the more part of the people 
remaining in their pride and wick-
edness, and the lesser part walking 
more circumspectly before God.

11 And these were the conditions 
also, in the eighty and eighth year 
of the reign of the judges.

12 And there was but little altera-
tion  in  the  affairs  of  the  people, 
save it were the people began to be 
more hardened in iniquity, and do 
more and more of that which was 
a contrary to the commandments of 
God, in the eighty and ninth year 
of the reign of the judges.

13 But it came to pass in the nine-
tieth year of the reign of the judges, 
there were a great signs given unto 
the people, and wonders; and the 
words  of  the  prophets  b began  to 
be fulfilled.

14 And  a angels  did  appear  unto 
men,  wise  men,  and  did  declare 
unto them glad tidings of great joy; 
thus in this year the scriptures be-
gan to be fulfilled.

15 Nevertheless, the people began 
to  harden  their  hearts,  all  save  it 
were the most believing part of them,  
both of the Nephites and also of the

Lamanites,  and  began  to  depend 
upon their a own strength and upon 
their own wisdom, saying:

16 Some  things  they  may  have 
guessed right, among so many; but 
behold, we know that all these great 
and marvelous works cannot come 
to pass, of which has been spoken.
17 And they began to reason and to 
contend among themselves, saying:
18 That it is a not reasonable that 
such a being as a Christ shall come; 
if so, and he be the Son of God, the 
Father of heaven and of earth, as it 
has been spoken, why will he not 
show himself unto us as well as unto 
them who shall be at Jerusalem?

19 Yea, why will he not show him-
self  in  this  land  as  well  as  in  the 
land of Jerusalem?

20 But behold, we know that this is 
a wicked a tradition, which has been 
handed down unto us by our fathers,  
to cause us that we should believe 
in some great and marvelous thing 
which should come to pass, but not 
among us, but in a land which is 
far distant, a land which we know 
not; therefore they can keep us in 
ignorance, for we cannot b witness 
with our own eyes that they are true.
21 And they will, by the cunning 
and the mysterious arts of the evil 

one, work some great mystery which 
we cannot understand, which will 
keep  us  down  to  be  servants  to 
their words, and also servants unto 
them, for we depend upon them to 
teach  us  the  word;  and  thus  will 
they keep us in ignorance if we will 
yield ourselves unto them, all the 
days of our lives.

22 And many more things did the 
people a imagine up in their hearts, 
which were foolish and b vain; and 
they were much disturbed, for Sa-
tan did stir them up to do iniquity 
continually;  yea,  he  did  go  about 
spreading c rumors and contentions 
upon all the face of the land, that 
he might harden the hearts of the 
people against that which was good 
and against that which should come.
23 And  notwithstanding  the 
signs and the wonders which were 
wrought among the people of the 
Lord, and the many miracles which 
they did, Satan did get great hold 
upon the hearts of the people upon 
all the face of the land.

24 And thus ended the ninetieth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

25 a And  thus  ended  the  book  of 
Helaman, according to the record 
of Helaman and his sons.

increase,  and  the  Gadianton  robbers 
slaughter many. About a.d. 1–4.

NOW it came to pass that the 

ninety  and  first  year  had 
passed away and it was a six 
hundred years from the time that 
Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in 
the  year  that  b Lachoneus  was  the 
chief judge and the governor over 
the land.

2 And  a Nephi,  the  son  of  Hela-
man, had departed out of the land 
of  Zarahemla,  giving  charge  unto 
his son b Nephi, who was his eldest 
son, concerning the c plates of brass, 
and d all the records which had been 
kept,  and  all  those  things  which 
had been kept sacred from the de-
parture of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

3 Then  he  a departed  out  of  the 
land, and b whither he went, no man 
knoweth;  and  his  son  Nephi  did 
keep the records in his stead, yea, 
the record of this people.

4 And it came to pass that in the 
commencement of the ninety and 
second year, behold, the prophecies 
of the prophets began to be fulfilled 
more  fully;  for  there  began  to  be 
a greater signs and greater miracles 
wrought among the people.

land; and the people who believed 
began  to  be  very  sorrowful,  lest 
by any means those things which 
had been spoken might not come  
to pass.

8 But behold, they did watch stead-
fastly for a that day and that night 
and  that  day  which  should  be  as 
one day as if there were no night, 
that  they  might  know  that  their 
faith had not been vain.

9 Now it came to pass that there 
was a day set apart by the  a unbe-
lievers, that all those who believed 
in those traditions should be b put to 
death except the c sign should come 
to pass, which had been given by 
Samuel the prophet.

10 Now it came to pass that when 
Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this 
wickedness of his people, his heart 
was exceedingly sorrowful.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
went out and bowed himself down 
upon the earth, and cried mightily 
to his God in behalf of his people, 
yea,  those  who  were  about  to  be 
destroyed because of their faith in 
the tradition of their fathers.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
cried  mightily  unto  the  Lord  a all 
that day; and behold, the b voice of 
the Lord came unto him, saying:

5 But there were some who began 
to say that the time was past for the 
words to be fulfilled, which were 
a spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.
6 And they began to a rejoice over 
their brethren, saying: Behold the 
time is past, and the words of Sam-
uel are not fulfilled; therefore, your 
joy and your faith concerning this 
thing hath been vain.

7 And it came to pass that they did 
make a great uproar throughout the

world, and to do the d will, e both f of 
the Father and of the Son—of the 
Father  because  of  me,  and  of  the 
Son because of my flesh. And be-
hold, the time is at hand, and this 
night shall the sign be given.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
words  which  came  unto  Nephi 
were  fulfilled,  according  as  they 
had been spoken; for behold, at the 
going down of the  a sun there was 
b no darkness; and the people began 
to be astonished because there was 
no darkness when the night came.
16 And  there  were  many,  who 
had not believed the words of the 
prophets, who a fell to the earth and 
became  as  if  they  were  dead,  for 
they knew that the great  b plan of 
destruction which they had laid for 
those who believed in the words of 
the prophets had been frustrated; 
for the sign which had been given 
was already at hand.

17 And they began to know that 
the Son of God must shortly appear; 
yea, in fine, all the people upon the 
face  of  the  whole  earth  from  the 
a west to the east, both in the land 
north and in the land south, were 
so exceedingly astonished that they 
fell to the earth.

18 For they knew that the proph-
ets had testified of these things for 
many years, and that the sign which 
had been given was already at hand; 
and they began to fear because of 
their iniquity and their unbelief.

19 And it came to pass that there 
was no darkness in all that night, 
but it was as light as though it was 
mid-day. And it came to pass that the 
sun did rise in the morning again, 
according to its proper order; and 
they knew that it was the day that 
the Lord should be a born, because 
of the b sign which had been given.

20 And it had come to pass, yea, 
all things, every whit, according to 
the words of the prophets.

21 And it came to pass also that 
a new  a star did appear, according 
to the word.

22 And it came to pass that from 
this  time  forth  there  began  to  be 
a lyings sent forth among the people, 
by Satan, to harden their hearts, to 
the intent that they might not be-
lieve in those  b signs and wonders 
which they had seen; but notwith-
standing these lyings and deceivings 
the  c more  part  of  the  people  did 
believe, and were converted unto  
the Lord.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi 
went forth among the people, and 
also  many  others,  baptizing  unto 
repentance, in the which there was 
a great a remission of sins. And thus 
the  people  began  again  to  have 
peace in the land.

24 And there were no contentions, 
save  it  were  a  few  that  began  to 
preach,  endeavoring  to  prove  by 
the a scriptures that it was no more 
expedient  to  observe  the  law  of 
Moses. Now in this thing they did 
err,  having  not  understood  the  
scriptures.

25 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
soon became converted, and were 
convinced of the error which they 
were  in,  for  it  was  made  known 
unto them that the law was not yet 
a fulfilled, and that it must be ful-
filled in every whit; yea, the word 
came  unto  them  that  it  must  be 
fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle 
should not pass away till it should 
all  be  fulfilled;  therefore  in  this 
same year were they brought to a 
knowledge  of  their  error  and  did 
b confess their faults.

year did pass away, bringing a glad 
tidings unto the people because of 
the signs which did come to pass, 
according to the words of the proph-
ecy of all the holy prophets.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
ninety and third year did also pass 
away in peace, save it were for the 
Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon 
the a mountains, who did infest the 
land; for so strong were their holds 
and  their  secret  places  that  the 
people could not overpower them; 
therefore  they  did  commit  many 
murders, and did do much slaugh-
ter among the people.

28 And it came to pass that in the 
ninety and fourth year they began 
to  increase  in  a  great  degree,  be-
cause there were many dissenters 
of the Nephites who did flee unto 
them,  which  did  cause  much  sor-
row unto those Nephites who did 
remain in the land.

29 And there was also a cause of 
much sorrow among the Lamanites; 
for behold, they had many children 
who did grow up and began to wax 
strong in years, that they became for 
themselves, and were a led away by 
some who were b Zoramites, by their 
lyings and their flattering words, 
to join those Gadianton robbers.

30 And thus were the Lamanites 
afflicted also, and began to decrease 
as to their faith and righteousness, 
because  of  the  wickedness  of  the 
a rising generation.

CHAPTER 2
Wickedness and abominations increase 
among the people—The Nephites and 
Lamanites unite to defend themselves 
against the Gadianton robbers—Con-
verted  Lamanites  become  white  and 
are called Nephites. About a.d. 5–16.
And  it  came  to  pass  that  thus 
passed  away  the  ninety  and  fifth 

year also, and the people began to 
forget  those  a signs  and  wonders 
which they had heard, and began 
to be less and less astonished at a 
sign or a wonder from heaven, in-
somuch that they began to be hard 
in their hearts, and blind in their 
minds, and began to disbelieve all 
which they had heard and seen—

2 a Imagining up some vain thing 
in their hearts, that it was wrought 
by  men  and  by  the  power  of  the 
devil,  to  lead  away  and  b deceive  
the hearts of the people; and thus 
did  Satan  get  possession  of  the 
hearts  of  the  people  again,  inso-
much that he did blind their eyes 
and lead them away to believe that 
the doctrine of Christ was a c foolish 
and a vain thing.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the  
people began to wax strong in wick-
edness and abominations; and they 
did not believe that there should be 
any more signs or wonders given; 
and  Satan  did  a go  about,  leading 
away  the  hearts  of  the  people, 
tempting them and causing them 
that they should do great wickedness  
in the land.

4 And  thus  did  pass  away  the 
ninety  and  sixth  year;  and  also  
the  ninety  and  seventh  year;  and 
also  the  ninety  and  eighth  year; 
and also the ninety and ninth year;
5 And  also  an  hundred  years 
had passed away since the days of  
a Mosiah,  who  was  king  over  the 
people of the Nephites.

6 And six hundred and nine years 
had  passed  away  since  Lehi  left  
Jerusalem.

7 And nine years had passed away 
from the time when the sign was 
given, which was spoken of by the 
prophets, that Christ should come 
into the world.

8 Now  the  Nephites  began  to 
a reckon their time from this period

when the sign was given, or from 
the coming of Christ; therefore, nine 
years had passed away.

9 And Nephi, who was the father 
of Nephi, who had the charge of the 
records, a did not return to the land 
of Zarahemla, and could nowhere 
be found in all the land.

10 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did still a remain in wickedness, 
notwithstanding the much preach-
ing  and  prophesying  which  was 
sent among them; and thus passed 
away the tenth year also; and the 
eleventh year also passed away in  
iniquity.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  
thirteenth year there began to be 
wars  and  contentions  throughout 
all the land; for the a Gadianton rob-
bers had become so b numerous, and  
did  slay  so  many  of  the  people,  
and did lay waste so many cities, and  
did  spread  so  much  death  and 
carnage throughout the land, that 
it  became  expedient  that  all  the 
people, both the Nephites and the 
Lamanites,  should  take  up  arms 
against them.

12 Therefore,  all  the  Lamanites 
who had become converted unto the 
Lord did unite with their brethren, 
the Nephites, and were compelled, 
for the a safety of their lives and their 
women and their children, to take 
up  arms  against  those  Gadianton  
robbers, yea, and also to maintain 
their rights, and the privileges of  
their church and of their worship,  
and their freedom and their b liberty.
13 And it came to pass that before 
this thirteenth year had passed away 
the Nephites were threatened with 
utter  destruction  because  of  this 
war, which had become exceedingly  
sore.

14 And it came to pass that those 
Lamanites who had united with the 
Nephites  were  numbered  among 
the Nephites;

15 And their a curse was taken from 
them, and their skin became b white 
like unto the Nephites;

16 And their young men and their 
daughters became exceedingly fair, 
and  they  were  numbered  among  
the Nephites, and were called Neph-
ites. And thus ended the thirteenth  
year.

17 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fourteenth year, 
the  war  between  the  robbers  and 
the people of Nephi did continue 
and did become exceedingly sore; 
nevertheless, the people of Nephi 
did  gain  some  advantage  of  the 
robbers,  insomuch  that  they  did 
drive them back out of their lands 
into the mountains and into their 
secret places.

18 And thus ended the fourteenth  
year. And in the fifteenth year they  
did come forth against the people 
of Nephi; and because of the wick-
edness of the people of Nephi, and 
their many contentions and dissen-
sions,  the  Gadianton  robbers  did 
gain many advantages over them.

19 And thus ended the fifteenth 
year, and thus were the people in 
a state of many afflictions; and the 
a sword of destruction did hang over 
them,  insomuch  that  they  were 
about  to  be  smitten  down  by  it, 
and this because of their iniquity.

CHAPTER 3

Giddianhi,  the  Gadianton  leader,  de-
mands that Lachoneus and the Neph-
ites  surrender  themselves  and  their 
lands—Lachoneus  appoints  Gidgid-
doni as chief captain of the armies—
The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla 
and  Bountiful  to  defend  themselves.  
About a.d. 16–18.
And now it came to pass that in the 
sixteenth year from the coming of 
Christ, a Lachoneus, the governor of 
the land, received an epistle from  

  9 a  3 Ne. 1:3 (2–3).

the leader and the governor of this 
band of robbers; and these were the 
words which were written, saying:
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief 
governor of the land, behold, I write 
this epistle unto you, and do give 
unto you exceedingly great praise 
because of your firmness, and also 
the  firmness  of  your  people,  in 
a maintaining that which ye suppose 
to be your right and b liberty; yea, 
ye do stand well, as if ye were sup-
ported by the hand of a god, in the 
defence of your liberty, and your 
property, and your country, or that  
which ye do call so.

3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, 
most  noble  Lachoneus,  that  ye 
should be so foolish and vain as to 
suppose that ye can stand against 
so many brave men who are at my 
command, who do now at this time 
stand in their arms, and do await 
with great anxiety for the word—
Go  down  upon  the  Nephites  and 
a destroy them.

4 And I, knowing of their uncon-
querable spirit, having proved them 
in the field of battle, and knowing of 
their everlasting hatred towards you 
because of the many wrongs which 
ye have done unto them, therefore 
if they should come down against 
you they would visit you with utter 
destruction.

5 Therefore  I  have  written  this  
epistle,  sealing  it  with  mine  own 
hand, feeling for your welfare, be-
cause of your firmness in that which 
ye believe to be right, and your noble  
spirit in the field of battle.

6 Therefore I write unto you, desir-
ing that ye would yield up unto this 
my people, your cities, your lands, 
and your possessions, rather than 
that they should visit you with the 
sword and that destruction should 
come upon you.

7 Or  in  other  words,  yield  your-

selves up unto us, and unite with 
us  and  become  acquainted  with 
our a secret works, and become our 
brethren that ye may be like unto 
us—not our slaves, but our brethren 
and partners of all our substance.
8 And behold, I a swear unto you, 
if ye will do this, with an oath, ye 
shall not be destroyed; but if ye will 
not do this, I swear unto you with 
an oath, that on the morrow month I 
will command that my armies shall 
come down against you, and they 
shall not stay their hand and shall 
spare not, but shall slay you, and 
shall  let  fall  the  sword  upon  you 
even until ye shall become extinct.
9 And  behold,  I  am  a Giddianhi; 
and I am the governor of this the 
b secret society of Gadianton; which 
society  and  the  works  thereof  I 
know to be c good; and they are of 
d ancient date and they have been 
handed down unto us.

10 And  I  write  this  epistle  unto 
you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye 
will deliver up your lands and your 
possessions, without the shedding 
of blood, that this my people may 
recover  their  rights  and  a govern-
ment,  who  have  dissented  away 
from you because of your wicked-
ness in retaining from them their 
rights of government, and except ye 
do this, I will avenge their wrongs. 
I am Giddianhi.

11 And now it came to pass when 
Lachoneus received this epistle he 
was  exceedingly  astonished,  be-
cause of the boldness of Giddianhi 
demanding  the  possession  of  the 
land  of  the  Nephites,  and  also  of 
threatening the people and aveng-
ing  the  wrongs  of  those  that  had 
received  no  wrong,  save  it  were 
they had  a wronged themselves by 
dissenting away unto those wicked 
and abominable robbers.

the governor, was a just man, and 
could  not  be  frightened  by  the 
demands  and  the  threatenings  of 
a  a robber;  therefore  he  did  not 
heark en to the epistle of Giddianhi, 
the governor of the robbers, but he 
did cause that his people should cry 
unto the Lord for b strength against 
the  time  that  the  robbers  should 
come down against them.

13 Yea,  he  sent  a  proclamation 
among  all  the  people,  that  they 
should a gather together their women, 
and their children, their flocks and  
their herds, and all their substance, 
save it were their land, unto one place.
14 And he caused that a fortifica-
tions should be built round about 
them,  and  the  strength  thereof 
should be exceedingly great. And 
he caused that armies, both of the 
Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of 
all them who were numbered among 
the Nephites, should be placed as 
guards round about to watch them, 
and to guard them from the robbers 
day and night.

15 Yea, he said unto them: As the 
Lord liveth, except ye repent of all 
your  iniquities,  and  cry  unto  the 
Lord, ye will in nowise be a delivered  
out of the hands of those Gadianton  
robbers.

16 And  so  great  and  marvelous 
were the words and prophecies of 
Lachoneus that they did cause fear 
to come upon all the people; and 
they did exert themselves in their 
might to do according to the words 
of Lachoneus.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  La-
choneus did appoint chief captains  
over all the armies of the Nephites, 
to command them at the time that 
the robbers should come down out 
of the wilderness against them.

18 Now the chiefest among all the 

chief captains and the great com-
mander  of  all  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites  was  appointed,  and  his 
name was a Gidgiddoni.

19 Now it was the custom among 
all the Nephites to appoint for their 
chief captains, (save it were in their 
times of wickedness) some one that 
had  the  a spirit  of  revelation  and 
also prophecy; therefore, this Gid-
giddoni was a great prophet among 
them, as also was the chief judge.
20 Now the people said unto Gid-
giddoni: a Pray unto the Lord, and let 
us go up upon the mountains and 
into  the  wilderness,  that  we  may 
fall upon the robbers and destroy 
them in their own lands.

21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: 
The Lord a forbid; for if we should 
go up against them the Lord would 
b deliver us into their hands; there-
fore  we  will  prepare  ourselves  in 
the center of our lands, and we will 
gather all our armies together, and 
we will not go against them, but we  
will wait till they shall come against 
us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if 
we do this he will deliver them into 
our hands.

22 And it came to pass in the sev-
enteenth year, in the latter end of 
the  year,  the  proclamation  of  La-
choneus had gone forth throughout 
all the face of the land, and they 
had taken their a horses, and their 
chariots,  and  their  cattle,  and  all 
their  flocks,  and  their  herds,  and 
their grain, and all their substance, 
and did march forth by thousands 
and by tens of thousands, until they 
had  all  gone  forth  to  the  b place 
which  c had  been  appointed  that 
they should gather themselves to-
gether, to defend themselves against  
their enemies.

appointed  was  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla,  and  the  land  which  was 
between  the  land  Zarahemla  and 
the  land  b Bountiful,  yea,  to  the 
line which was between the c land 
Bountiful and the land Desolation.
24 And there were a great many 
thousand people who were called 
Nephites,  who  did  gather  them-
selves  together  in  this  land.  Now 
Lachoneus  did  cause  that  they 
should gather themselves together 
in the land a southward, because of 
the great curse which was upon the 
b land northward.

25 And they did fortify themselves 
against their enemies; and they did 
dwell in one land, and in one body, 
and they did fear the words which 
had  been  spoken  by  Lachoneus, 
insomuch that they did repent of 
all their sins; and they did put up 
their a prayers unto the Lord their 
God, that he would deliver them in 
the time that their enemies should 
come down against them to battle.
26 And they were exceedingly sor-
rowful  because  of  their  enemies. 
And Gidgiddoni did cause that they 
should make a weapons of war of ev-
ery kind, and they should be strong 
with armor, and with shields, and 
with bucklers, after the manner of 
his instruction.

CHAPTER 4

The Nephite armies defeat the Gadian-
ton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his 
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The 
Nephites praise the Lord for their vic-
tories. About a.d. 19–22.
And it came to pass that in the lat-
ter end of the eighteenth year those 
armies  of   a robbers  had  prepared 
for battle, and began to come down 
and  to  sally  forth  from  the  hills, 
and out of the mountains, and the 

wilderness, and their strongholds, 
and  their  b secret  places,  and  be-
gan to take possession of the lands, 
both which were in the land south 
and which were in the land north,  
and began to take possession of all 
the lands which had been c deserted 
by the Nephites, and the cities which 
had been left desolate.

2 But behold, there were no wild 
beasts  nor  a game  in  those  lands 
which  had  been  deserted  by  the 
Nephites,  and  there  was  no  game 
for the robbers save it were in the 
wilderness.

3 And the robbers could not exist 
save it were in the wilderness, for 
the want of food; for the Nephites 
had  left  their  lands  desolate,  and 
had gathered their flocks and their 
herds and all their substance, and 
they were in one body.

4 Therefore, there was no chance 
for the robbers to plunder and to 
obtain food, save it were to come 
up in open battle against the Neph-
ites; and the Nephites being in one 
body, and having so great a num-
ber, and having reserved for them-
selves provisions, and a horses and 
cattle, and flocks of every kind, that 
they  might  subsist  for  the  space 
of b seven years, in the which time 
they did hope to destroy the rob-
bers from off the face of the land; 
and  thus  the  eighteenth  year  did  
pass away.

5 And it came to pass that in the 
nineteenth  year  Giddianhi  found 
that it was expedient that he should 
go up to battle against the Neph-
ites, for there was a no way that they 
could subsist save it were to plun-
der and rob and murder.

6 And they durst not spread them-
selves upon the face of the land in-
somuch that they could raise grain, 
lest the Nephites should come upon

them and slay them; therefore Gid-
dianhi  gave  commandment  unto 
his  armies  that  in  this  year  they 
should go up to battle against the  
Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that they did 
come up to battle; and it was in the 
sixth month; and behold, great and 
terrible was the day that they did 
come up to battle; and they were 
girded about after the manner of 
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin 
about  their  loins,  and  they  were 
dyed in blood, and their heads were 
shorn,  and  they  had  head-plates 
upon them; and great and terrible 
was the appearance of the armies of 
Giddianhi, because of their armor,  
and  because  of  their  being  dyed 
in blood.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Nephites, when they 
saw  the  appearance  of  the  army 
of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the 
earth, and did lift their cries to the 
Lord their God, that he would spare 
them and deliver them out of the 
hands of their enemies.

9 And it came to pass that when 
the  armies  of  Giddianhi  saw  this 
they  began  to  shout  with  a  loud 
voice, because of their joy, for they 
had supposed that the Nephites had 
fallen with fear because of the ter-
ror of their armies.

10 But  in  this  thing  they  were 
disappointed, for the Nephites did 
not  a fear  them;  but  they  did  fear 
their God and did supplicate him 
for b protection; therefore, when the 
armies of Giddianhi did rush upon 
them they were prepared to meet 
them;  yea,  in  the  strength  of  the 
Lord they did receive them.

11 And the battle commenced in 
this the sixth month; and great and 
terrible was the battle thereof, yea, 
great and terrible was the a slaughter 
thereof, insomuch that there never 
was  known  so  great  a  slaughter 
among all the people of Lehi since 
he left Jerusalem.

12 And  notwithstanding  the 
a threatenings and the oaths which 
Giddianhi  had  made,  behold,  the 
Nephites did beat them, insomuch 
that they did fall back from before 
them.

13 And it came to pass that a Gid-
giddoni commanded that his armies 
should  pursue  them  as  far  as  the 
borders of the wilderness, and that 
they  should  not  spare  any  that 
should fall into their hands by the 
way; and thus they did pursue them 
and did slay them, to the borders 
of the wilderness, even until they 
had fulfilled the commandment of 
Gidgiddoni.

14 And it came to pass that Gid-
dianhi, who had stood and fought 
with boldness, was pursued as he 
fled; and being weary because of 
his much fighting he was overtaken 
and slain. And thus was the end of 
Giddianhi the robber.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Nephites did return 
again to their place of security. And 
it came to pass that this nineteenth 
year  did  pass  away,  and  the  rob-
bers did not come again to battle; 
neither did they come again in the 
twentieth year.

16 And in the twenty and first year 
they did not come up to battle, but 
they came up on all sides to lay siege 
round about the people of Nephi; 
for  they  did  suppose  that  if  they 
should cut off the people of Nephi 
from their a lands, and should hem 
them in on every side, and if they 
should cut them off from all their 
outward privileges, that they could 
cause them to yield themselves up 
according to their wishes.

17 Now they had appointed unto 
themselves  another  leader,  whose 
name  was  Zemnarihah;  therefore 
it was Zemnarihah that did cause 
that this siege should take place.

18 But  behold,  this  was  an  ad-
vantage to the Nephites; for it was 
impossible  for  the  robbers  to  lay

siege sufficiently long to have any 
effect upon the Nephites, because 
of  their  a much  b provision  which 
they had laid up in store,

19 And because of the scantiness 
of  provisions  among  the  robbers; 
for behold, they had nothing save 
it were meat for their subsistence, 
which meat they did obtain in the 
wilderness;

20 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a wild game became scarce in the wil-
derness insomuch that the robbers 
were about to perish with hunger.
21 And the Nephites were continu-
ally  marching  out  by  day  and  by 
night, and falling upon their armies, 
and cutting them off by thousands 
and by tens of thousands.

22 And thus it became the desire of 
the people of Zemnarihah to with-
draw from their design, because of 
the great destruction which came 
upon them by night and by day.

23 And it came to pass that Zem-
narihah did give command unto his 
people that they should withdraw 
themselves  from  the  siege,  and 
march into the furthermost parts 
of the land northward.

24 And  now,  Gidgiddoni  being 
aware of their design, and knowing 
of  their  weakness  because  of  the 
want of food, and the great slaugh-
ter  which  had  been  made  among 
them, therefore he did send out his 
armies in the night-time, and did 
cut off the way of their retreat, and 
did place his armies in the way of 
their retreat.

25 And  this  did  they  do  in  the 
night-time, and got on their march 
beyond the robbers, so that on the 
morrow,  when  the  robbers  began 
their march, they were met by the 
armies of the Nephites both in their 
front and in their rear.

26 And the robbers who were on 
the south were also cut off in their 

places  of  retreat.  And  all  these 
things were done by command of 
Gidgiddoni.

27 And  there  were  many  thou-
sands who did yield themselves up 
prisoners  unto  the  Nephites,  and 
the remainder of them were slain.
28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, 
was taken and hanged upon a tree, 
yea, even upon the top thereof un-
til  he  was  dead.  And  when  they 
had hanged him until he was dead 
they did fell the tree to the earth, 
and  did  cry  with  a  loud  voice,  
saying:

29 May the Lord preserve his peo-
ple in righteousness and in holiness 
of heart, that they may cause to be 
felled to the earth all who shall seek 
to slay them because of power and 
secret  combinations,  even  as  this 
man hath been felled to the earth.
30 And they did rejoice and cry 
again with one voice, saying: May 
the a God of Abraham, and the God 
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, pro-
tect this people in righteousness, so 
long as they shall b call on the name 
of their God for c protection.

31 And it came to pass that they 
did break forth, all as one, in sing-
ing,  and  a praising  their  God  for 
the great thing which he had done 
for them, in preserving them from 
falling  into  the  hands  of  their  
enemies.

32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to 
the Most High God. And they did 
cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord 
God a Almighty, the Most High God.
33 And their hearts were swollen 
with joy, unto the gushing out of 
many  tears,  because  of  the  great 
goodness of God in delivering them 
out of the hands of their enemies; 
and  they  knew  it  was  because  of 
their repentance and their humility 
that they had been delivered from 
an everlasting destruction.

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites repent and forsake their 
sins—Mormon writes the history of his 
people and declares the everlasting word 
to them—Israel will be gathered in from 
her long dispersion. About a.d. 22–26.

And now behold, there was not a 
living  soul  among  all  the  people 
of the Nephites who did a doubt in 
the least the words of all the holy 
prophets who had spoken; for they 
knew  that  it  must  needs  be  that 
they must be fulfilled.

2 And they knew that it must be 
expedient that Christ had come, be-
cause of the many signs which had 
been given, according to the words 
of the prophets; and because of the 
things which had come to pass al-
ready they knew that it must needs 
be that all things should come to 
pass according to that which had 
been spoken.

3 Therefore  they  did  forsake  all 
their sins, and their abominations, 
and their whoredoms, and did serve  
God with all diligence day and night.
4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when  they  had  taken  all  the  rob-
bers prisoners, insomuch that none 
did escape who were not slain, they 
did cast their prisoners into prison, 
and did cause the word of God to be 
preached unto them; and as many 
as would repent of their sins and 
a enter  into  a  b covenant  that  they 
would murder no more were set at  
c liberty.

5 But as many as there were who 
did not enter into a covenant, and 
who did still continue to have those 
a secret murders in their hearts, yea, 
as many as were found breathing 
out threatenings against their breth-
ren were condemned and punished 
according to the law.

6 And  thus  they  did  put  an  end 

to  all  those  wicked,  and  secret, 
and  abominable  combinations, 
in  the  which  there  was  so  much 
wickedness, and so many murders 
committed.

7 And  thus  had  the  a twenty  and 
second year passed away, and the 
twenty and third year also, and the 
twenty and fourth, and the twenty 
and fifth; and thus had twenty and 
five years passed away.

8 And there had many things tran-
spired which, in the eyes of some, 
would be great and marvelous; nev-
ertheless, they cannot all be written 
in this book; yea, this book cannot 
contain  even  a  a hundredth  part 
of what was done among so many 
people in the space of twenty and 
five years;

9 But  behold  there  are  a records 
which do contain b all the proceed-
ings of this people; and a c shorter  
but  true  account  was  given  by 
Nephi.

10 Therefore  I  have  made  my 
a record  of  these  things  according 
to the record of Nephi, which was 
engraven on the plates which were 
called the b plates of Nephi.

11 And  behold,  I  do  make  the 
record on plates which I have made 
with mine own hands.

12 And behold, I am called a Mor-
mon, being called after the b land of 
Mormon, the land in which Alma 
did establish the church among the 
people, yea, the first church which 
was established among them after 
their transgression.

13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God. I have been 
a called of him to declare his word 
among his people, that they might 
have everlasting life.

14 And it hath become expedient 
that I, according to the will of God,

gone hence, who were the holy ones,  
should be fulfilled according to their  
faith, should make a a record of these 
things which have been done—

15 Yea, a a small record of that which  
hath taken place from the time that 
Lehi left Jerusalem, even down un-
til the present time.

16 Therefore I do make my record 
from the accounts which have been 
given by those who were before me, 
until the commencement of my day;
17 And then I do make a a record of 
the things which I have seen with 
mine own eyes.

18 And I know the record which I 
make to be a just and a true record; 
nevertheless there are many things 
which, according to our a language, 
we are not able to b write.

19 And now I make an end of my 
saying,  which  is  of  myself,  and 
proceed to give my account of the 
things which have been before me.
20 I am Mormon, and a pure a de-
scendant of Lehi. I have reason to 
bless my God and my Savior Jesus 
Christ, that he brought our fathers 
out of the land of Jerusalem, (and 
b no one knew it save it were him-
self  and  those  whom  he  brought 
out of that land) and that he hath 
given me and my people so much 
knowledge  unto  the  salvation  of  
our souls.

21 Surely  he  hath  a blessed  the 
house  of  b Jacob,  and  hath  been 
c merciful unto the seed of Joseph.
22 And a insomuch as the children 
of  Lehi  have  kept  his  command-
ments  he  hath  blessed  them  and 
prospered  them  according  to  his 
word.

23 Yea, and surely shall he again 
bring a a remnant of the seed of Jo-
seph to the b knowledge of the Lord 
their God.

24 And as surely as the Lord liv-
eth, will he a gather in from the four 
quarters of the earth all the rem-
nant of the b seed of Jacob, who are 
scattered abroad upon all the face 
of the earth.

25 And as he hath a covenanted with 
all the house of Jacob, even so shall 
the  covenant  wherewith  he  hath 
covenanted with the house of Jacob 
be  fulfilled  in  his  own  due  time, 
unto  the  b restoring  all  the  house 
of Jacob unto the knowledge of the 
covenant that he hath covenanted  
with them.

26 And then shall they a know their 
Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God; and then shall they be 
gathered in from the four quarters 
of the earth unto their own lands, 
from whence they have been dis-
persed;  yea,  as  the  Lord  liveth  so 
shall it be. Amen.

CHAPTER 6
The Nephites prosper—Pride, wealth, 
and  class  distinctions  arise —The 
Church is rent with dissensions—Sa-
tan leads the people in open rebellion—
Many prophets cry repentance and are 
slain—Their murderers conspire to take 
over the government. About a.d. 26–30.
And now it came to pass that the 
people of the Nephites did all return 
to  their  own  lands  in  the  twenty 
and  sixth  year,  every  man,  with 
his family, his flocks and his herds, 
his  a horses and his cattle, and all

things whatsoever did belong unto 
them.

2 And it came to pass that they had 
a not eaten up all their provisions; 
therefore they did take with them 
all that they had not devoured, of 
all their grain of every kind, and 
their gold, and their silver, and all 
their precious things, and they did 
return to their own lands and their 
possessions, both on the north and 
on the south, both on the land north-
ward and on the land southward.

3 And  they  granted  unto  those 
robbers  who  had  a entered  into  a 
covenant to keep the peace of the 
land, who were desirous to remain 
Lamanites, lands, according to their 
numbers, that they might have, with 
their labors, wherewith to subsist 
upon; and thus they did establish 
peace in all the land.

4 And they began again to prosper 
and to wax great; and the twenty 
and sixth and seventh years passed 
away,  and  there  was  great  a order 
in the land; and they had formed 
their laws according to equity and 
justice.

5 And now there was nothing in 
all  the  land  to  hinder  the  people 
from prospering continually, except 
they should fall into transgression.
6 And now it was a Gidgiddoni, and 
the  judge,  b Lachoneus,  and  those 
who  had  been  appointed  leaders, 
who had established this great peace 
in the land.

7 And it came to pass that there 
were many cities built anew, and 
there were many old cities repaired.
8 And there were many a highways 
cast  up,  and  many  roads  made, 
which  led  from  city  to  city,  and 
from land to land, and from place 
to place.

9 And thus passed away the twenty 
and eighth year, and the people had 
continual peace.

10 But it came to pass in the twenty 
and ninth year there began to be 
some disputings among the people; 
and some were lifted up unto pride 
and a boastings because of their ex-
ceedingly  great  riches,  yea,  even 
unto great persecutions;

11 For  there  were  many  a mer-
chants in the land, and also many 
b lawyers, and many officers.

12 And  the  people  began  to  be 
distinguished by ranks, according 
to their  a riches and their chances 
for learning; yea, some were b igno-
rant because of their poverty, and 
others did receive great  c learning 
because of their riches.

13 Some were lifted up in pride, and 
others  were  exceedingly  humble;  
some did return railing for railing, 
while others would receive railing 
and  a persecution  and  all  manner 
of b afflictions, and would not turn 
and c revile again, but were humble 
and penitent before God.

14 And thus there became a great 
inequality in all the land, insomuch 
that the church began to be broken 
up; yea, insomuch that in the thirti-
eth year the church was broken up 
in all the land save it were among 
a few of the Lamanites who were 
converted unto the true faith; and 
a they would not depart from it, for 
they were firm, and steadfast, and 
immovable, willing with all  b dili-
gence to keep the commandments 
of the Lord.

15 Now the cause of this iniquity 
of the people was this—a Satan had 
great b power, unto the stirring up 
of the people to do all manner of 
iniquity, and to the puffing them up

with pride, tempting them to seek 
for power, and authority, and c riches, 
and the vain things of the world.

16 And thus Satan did lead away 
the hearts of the people to do all 
manner of iniquity; therefore they 
had enjoyed peace but a few years.
17 And thus, in the commencement 
of  the  thirtieth  year—the  people 
having been a delivered up for the 
space of a long time to be carried 
about  by  the  b temptations  of  the 
devil whithersoever he desired to 
carry them, and to do whatsoever 
iniquity he desired they should—
and thus in the commencement of 
this, the thirtieth year, they were in 
a state of awful wickedness.

18 Now  they  did  not  sin  a igno-
rantly, for they knew the b will of God 
concerning  them,  for  it  had  been 
taught  unto  them;  therefore  they  
did wilfully c rebel against God.

19 And now it was in the days of 
Lachoneus, the son of a Lachoneus, 
for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his 
father  and  did  govern  the  people  
that year.

20 And there began to be men a in-
spired from heaven and sent forth, 
standing among the people in all 
the land, preaching and testifying 
boldly of the sins and iniquities of 
the people, and testifying unto them 
concerning the redemption which 
the Lord would make for his peo-
ple, or in other words, the resurrec-
tion of Christ; and they did testify 
boldly of his b death and sufferings.
21 Now  there  were  many  of  the 
people who were exceedingly an-
gry because of those who testified 
of these things; and those who were 
angry were chiefly the chief judges, 
and they who a had been high priests 
and lawyers; yea, all those who were 

lawyers were angry with those who 
testified of these things.

22 Now there was no lawyer nor 
judge  nor  high  priest  that  could 
have power to condemn any one to 
death save their condemnation was 
signed by the governor of the land.
23 Now there were many of those 
a who testified of the things pertain-
ing to Christ who testified boldly, 
who were taken and put to death 
b secretly  by  the  judges,  that  the 
knowledge of their death came not 
unto the governor of the land until 
after their death.

24 Now behold, this was contrary 
to  the  laws  of  the  land,  that  any 
man should be put to death except 
they had power from the governor 
of the land—

25 Therefore a complaint came up 
unto the land of Zarahemla, to the 
governor of the land, against these 
judges  who  had  condemned  the 
prophets of the Lord unto  a death, 
not according to the law.

26 Now it came to pass that they 
were taken and brought up before 
the judge, to be judged of the crime 
which they had done, according to 
the a law which had been given by 
the people.

27 Now it came to pass that those 
judges had many friends and kin-
dreds; and the remainder, yea, even 
almost all the lawyers and the high 
priests,  did  gather  themselves  to-
gether, and unite with the kindreds 
of those judges who were to be tried 
according to the law.

28 And they did enter into a a cov-
enant  one  with  another,  yea,  even 
into that covenant which was given 
by them of old, which covenant was 
given and administered by the b devil, 
to combine against all righteousness.

29 Therefore  they  did  combine 
against the people of the Lord, and 
enter  into  a  covenant  to  destroy 
them, and to deliver those who were 
guilty of murder from the grasp of 
justice, which was about to be ad-
ministered according to the law.

30 And they did set at defiance the 
law and the rights of their country; 
and they did covenant one with an-
other to destroy the governor, and 
to establish a a king over the land, 
that  the  land  should  no  more  be 
at  b liberty  but  should  be  subject 
unto kings.

CHAPTER 7

The chief judge is murdered, the gov-
ernment  is  destroyed,  and  the  people 
divide  into  tribes—Jacob,  an  anti-
Christ, becomes king of a secret com-
bination—Nephi preaches repentance 
and  faith  in  Christ—Angels  minister 
to him daily, and he raises his brother 
from the dead—Many repent and are 
baptized. About a.d. 30–33.
Now behold, I will show unto you 
that they did not establish a king 
over the land; but in this same year, 
yea,  the  thirtieth  year,  they  did 
destroy  upon  the  judgment-seat, 
yea, did murder the chief judge of 
the land.

2 And the people were divided one 
against another; and they did a sepa-
rate one from another into tribes, 
every man according to his family 
and  his  kindred  and  friends;  and 
thus they did destroy the govern-
ment of the land.

3 And  every  tribe  did  appoint  a 
chief  or  a  leader  over  them;  and 
thus they became tribes and lead-
ers of tribes.

4 Now behold, there was no man 
among them save he had much fam-
ily and many kindreds and friends; 
therefore  their  tribes  became  ex-
ceedingly great.

5 Now all this was done, and there 
were no wars as yet among them; 
and all this iniquity had come upon 
the people a because they did b yield 
themselves unto the power of Satan.
6 And the regulations of the gov-
ernment  were  destroyed,  because 
of  the  a secret  combination  of  the 
friends and kindreds of those who 
murdered the prophets.

7 And they did cause a great con-
tention in the land, insomuch that 
the more righteous part of the peo-
ple had nearly all become wicked; 
yea, there were but few righteous 
men among them.

8 And thus six years had not passed 
away  since  the  more  part  of  the 
people had turned from their righ-
teousness, like the dog to his a vomit, 
or  like  the  sow  to  her  wallowing  
in the mire.

9 Now  this  secret  combination, 
which  had  brought  so  great  iniq-
uity  upon  the  people,  did  gather 
themselves together, and did place 
at their head a man whom they did 
call Jacob;

10 And  they  did  call  him  their 
king;  therefore  he  became  a  king 
over this wicked band; and he was 
one of the chiefest who had given 
his voice against the prophets who 
testified of Jesus.

11 And it came to pass that they 
were  not  so  strong  in  number  as 
the tribes of the people, who were 
united together save it were their 
leaders  did  establish  their  laws, 
every  one  according  to  his  tribe; 
nevertheless they were enemies; not-
withstanding they were not a righ-
teous people, yet they were united 
in the hatred of those who had en-
tered into a covenant to a destroy the  
government.

12 Therefore,  Jacob  seeing  that 
their enemies were more numerous

people that they should take their 
flight into the northernmost part of 
the land, and there build up unto 
themselves a a kingdom, until they 
were joined by dissenters, (for he 
flattered them that there would be 
many dissenters) and they become 
sufficiently strong to contend with 
the tribes of the people; and they 
did so.

13 And so speedy was their march 
that it could not be impeded until 
they had gone forth out of the reach 
of the people. And thus ended the 
thirtieth  year;  and  thus  were  the 
affairs of the people of Nephi.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
thirty and first year that they were 
divided  into  tribes,  every  man 
according  to  his  family,  kindred 
and friends; nevertheless they had 
come  to  an  agreement  that  they 
would not go to war one with an-
other; but they were not united as 
to their laws, and their manner of 
government, for they were estab-
lished  according  to  the  minds  of 
those  who  were  their  chiefs  and 
their leaders. But they did estab-
lish very strict laws that one tribe 
should not trespass against another, 
insomuch that in some degree they 
had peace in the land; nevertheless, 
their hearts were turned from the 
Lord their God, and they did stone 
the  a prophets  and  did  cast  them 
out from among them.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that 
a Nephi—having been visited by an-
gels and also the voice of the Lord, 
therefore having seen angels, and 
being eye-witness, and having had 
power given unto him that he might 
know  concerning  the  ministry  of 
Christ, and also being eye-witness 
to  their  quick  return  from  righ-
teousness unto their wickedness and  
abominations;

16 Therefore,  being  a grieved  for 
the  hardness  of  their  hearts  and 
the blindness of their minds—went 
forth  among  them  in  that  same 
year, and began to testify, boldly, 
repentance  and  remission  of  sins 
through  faith  on  the  Lord  Jesus  
Christ.

17 And  he  did  minister  many 
things unto them; and all of them 
cannot  be  written,  and  a  part  of 
them would not suffice, therefore 
they are not written in this book. 
And Nephi did minister with a power 
and with great authority.

18 And it came to pass that they 
were angry with him, even because 
he  had  greater  power  than  they, 
for it were a not possible that they 
could disbelieve his words, for so 
great was his faith on the Lord Jesus 
Christ that angels did minister unto  
him daily.

19 And in the name of Jesus did he 
cast out devils and a unclean spirits; 
and even his b brother did he c raise 
from the dead, after he had been 
stoned and suffered death by the 
people.

20 And the people saw it, and did 
witness of it, and were angry with 
him because of his power; and he 
did also do  a many more miracles, 
in  the  sight  of  the  people,  in  the 
name of Jesus.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
thirty and first year did pass away, 
and there were but few who were 
converted  unto  the  Lord;  but  as 
many as were converted did truly 
signify unto the people that they 
had been a visited by the power and 
b Spirit of God, which was in Jesus 
Christ, in whom they believed.

22 And as many as had devils cast 
out  from  them,  and  were  a healed 
of their sicknesses and their infir-
mities, did truly manifest unto the

people that they had been wrought 
upon by the Spirit of God, and had 
been  healed;  and  they  did  show 
forth  signs  also  and  did  do  some 
miracles among the people.

23 Thus  passed  away  the  thirty 
and  second  year  also.  And  Nephi 
did cry unto the people in the com-
mencement of the thirty and third 
year; and he did preach unto them 
repentance and remission of sins.
24 Now  I  would  have  you  to  re-
member also, that there were none 
who were brought unto a repentance 
who were not baptized with water.
25 Therefore, there were ordained 
of Nephi, men unto this ministry, 
that all such as should come unto 
them should be a baptized with wa-
ter, and this as a witness and a tes-
timony  before  God,  and  unto  the 
people, that they had repented and 
received a b remission of their sins.
26 And  there  were  many  in  the 
commencement  of  this  year  that 
were  baptized  unto  repentance; 
and thus the more part of the year 
did pass away.

CHAPTER 8
Tempests,  earthquakes,  fires,  whirl-
winds,  and  physical  upheavals  attest 
the crucifixion of Christ—Many people 
are  destroyed—Darkness  covers  the 
land for three days—Those who remain 
bemoan their fate. About a.d. 33–34.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  ac-
cording to our record, and we know 
our record to be a true, for behold, 
it  was  a  b just  man  who  did  keep 
the record—for he truly did c many 
d miracles in the e name of Jesus; and 

there was not any man who could 
do a miracle in the name of Jesus 
save he were cleansed every whit 
from his iniquity—

2 And  now  it  came  to  pass,  if 
there  was  no  mistake  made  by 
this  man  in  the  reckoning  of  our 
time, the a thirty and third year had  
passed away;

3 And  the  people  began  to  look 
with great earnestness for the sign  
which had been given by the prophet  
Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the 
time that there should be a darkness 
for the space of three days over the 
face of the land.

4 And  there  began  to  be  great 
a doubtings and b disputations among 
the  people,  notwithstanding  so 
many signs had been given.

5 And it came to pass in the a thirty 
and fourth year, in the first month, 
on  the  fourth  day  of  the  month, 
there arose a great b storm, such an 
one as never had been known in all  
the land.

6 And there was also a great and 
terrible tempest; and there was ter-
rible a thunder, insomuch that it did 
b shake the whole earth as if it was 
about to divide asunder.

7 And  there  were  exceedingly 
sharp lightnings, such as never had 
been known in all the land.

8 And the a city of Zarahemla did 

take fire.

9 And the city of a Moroni did b sink 
into the depths of the sea, and the 
inhabitants thereof were drowned.
10 And the earth was carried up 
upon the city of a Moronihah, that in 
the place of the city there became 
a great b mountain.

11 And there was a great and ter-
rible destruction in the land south-
ward.

12 But behold, there was a more 
great  and  terrible  destruction  in 
the  land  northward;  for  behold, 
the  a whole  face  of  the  land  was 
changed,  because  of  the  tempest 
and the whirlwinds, and the thun-
derings and the lightnings, and the 
exceedingly  great  quaking  of  the 
whole earth;

13 And  the  a highways  were  bro-
ken  up,  and  the  level  roads  were 
spoiled,  and  many  smooth  places 
became rough.

14 And many  a great and notable 
cities were  b sunk, and many were 
c burned,  and  many  were  shaken 
till the buildings thereof had fallen 
to  the  earth,  and  the  inhabitants 
thereof were slain, and the places 
were left desolate.

15 And  there  were  some  cities 
which  remained;  but  the  damage 
thereof was exceedingly great, and 
there were many in them who were  
slain.

16 And there were some who were 
carried away in the a whirlwind; and 
whither they went no man knoweth,  
save they know that they were car-
ried away.

17 And thus the face of the whole 
earth became deformed, because of 
the tempests, and the thunderings, 
and the lightnings, and the quaking 
of the earth.

18 And  behold,  the  rocks  were 
rent in twain; they were broken up 
upon the face of the whole earth, 
insomuch  that  they  were  a found 
in broken fragments, and in seams 
and in cracks, upon all the face of 
the land.

19 And it came to pass that when 
the thunderings, and the lightnings, 
and  the  storm,  and  the  tempest, 

and the quakings of the earth did 
cease—for behold, they did last for 
about  the  space  of  a three  b hours; 
and  it  was  said  by  some  that  the 
time was greater; nevertheless, all 
these great and terrible things were 
done  in  about  the  space  of  three 
hours—and then behold, there was 
c darkness upon the face of the land.
20 And it came to pass that there 
was thick darkness upon all the face 
of the land, insomuch that the in-
habitants thereof who had not fallen  
could a feel the b vapor of darkness;
21 And there could be no light, be-
cause of the darkness, neither can-
dles, neither torches; neither could 
there be fire kindled with their fine 
and exceedingly dry wood, so that 
there could not be any light at all;
22 And  there  was  not  any  light 
seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, nei-
ther the sun, nor the moon, nor the 
stars, for so great were the mists of 
darkness which were upon the face 
of the land.

23 And it came to pass that it did 
last for the space of three days that 
there was no light seen; and there 
was great mourning and a howling 
and weeping among all the people 
continually;  yea,  great  were  the 
groanings of the people, because of 
the darkness and the great destruc-
tion which had come upon them.

24 And  in  one  place  they  were 
heard to cry, saying: O that we had 
repented  a before  this  great  and 
terrible  day,  and  then  would  our 
brethren  have  been  spared,  and 
they would not have been b burned 
in that great city Zarahemla.

25 And in another place they were 
heard to cry and mourn, saying: O 
that  we  had  repented  before  this 
great  and  terrible  day,  and  had 
not killed and stoned the prophets,  
and cast them out; then would our

mothers and our fair daughters, and 
our children have been spared, and 
not  have  been  buried  up  in  that 
great  city  a Moronihah.  And  thus 
were  the  howlings  of  the  people 
great and terrible.

CHAPTER 9
In the darkness, the voice of Christ pro-
claims the destruction of many people 
and  cities  for  their  wickedness—He 
also proclaims His divinity, announces 
that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and 
invites men to come unto Him and be 
saved. About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that there was a 
a voice heard among all the inhabi-
tants of the earth, upon all the face 
of this land, crying:

2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo 
unto the inhabitants of the whole 
earth except they shall a repent; for 
the devil b laugheth, and his angels 
rejoice, because of the slain of the 
fair sons and daughters of my peo-
ple; and it is because of their iniq-
uity  and  abominations  that  they 
are fallen!

3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla 
have I  a burned with fire, and the 
inhabitants thereof.

4 And behold, that great city Mo-
roni have I caused to be a sunk in the  
depths of the sea, and the inhabi-
tants thereof to be drowned.

5 And behold, that great city a Mo-
ronihah have I covered with earth, 
and the inhabitants thereof, to hide 
their iniquities and their abomina-
tions from before my face, that the 
blood of the prophets and the saints 
shall not come any more unto me 
against them.

6 And  behold,  the  city  of  Gilgal 
have I caused to be sunk, and the 
inhabitants thereof to be buried up 
in the depths of the earth;

7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and 
the  inhabitants  thereof,  and  the 
city of Mocum and the inhabitants 
thereof, and the city of a Jerusalem 
and  the  inhabitants  thereof;  and 
b waters have I caused to come up 
in the stead thereof, to hide their 
wickedness and abominations from 
before my face, that the c blood of 
the  prophets  and  the  saints  shall 
d not  come  up  any  more  unto  me 
against them.

8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, 
and  the  city  of  Gadiomnah,  and 
the  city  of  Jacob,  and  the  city  of 
Gimgimno, all these have I caused 
to be sunk, and made a hills and val-
leys in the places thereof; and the 
inhabitants thereof have I b buried 
up  in  the  depths  of  the  earth,  to 
hide their wickedness and abomi-
nations from before my face, that 
the blood of the prophets and the 
saints should not come up any more 
unto me against them.

9 And  behold,  that  great  city 
Jacobu gath,  which  was  inhabited 
by the people of king Jacob, have I  
caused to be burned with fire be-
cause of their sins and their a wick-
edness,  which  was  above  all  the 
wickedness of the whole earth, be-
cause of their b secret murders and 
combinations; for it was they that did 
c destroy the peace of my people and 
the government of the land; there-
fore I did cause them to be burned, 
to  d destroy  them  from  before  my 
face, that the blood of the prophets 
and the saints should not come up  
unto me any more against them.

10 And behold, the city of Laman, 
and the city of Josh, and the city 
of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, 
have  I  caused  to  be  burned  with 
fire,  and  the  inhabitants  thereof, 
because of their wickedness in cast-
ing out the prophets, and stoning 
those whom I did send to declare 
unto them concerning their wick-
edness and their abominations.

11 And  because  they  did  cast 
them all out, that there were none 
righteous among them, I did send 
down a fire and destroy them, that 
their wickedness and abominations 
might be hid from before my b face, 
that the blood of the prophets and 
the saints whom I sent among them 
might  not  cry  unto  me  c from  the 
ground against them.

12 And a many great destructions 
have I caused to come upon this land,  
and  upon  this  people,  because  of 
their wickedness and their abomi-
nations.

13 O all ye that are a spared because 
ye were more b righteous than they, 
will ye not now return unto me, and  
repent  of  your  sins,  and  be  con-
verted, that I may c heal you?

14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye 
will  a come unto me ye shall have 
b eternal life. Behold, mine c arm of 
mercy is extended towards you, and 
whosoever  will  come,  him  will  I 
receive; and blessed are those who 
come unto me.

15 Behold,  I  am  Jesus  Christ  the 
Son of God. I a created the heavens 

and the earth, and all things that in 
them are. I was with the Father from 
the beginning. b I am in the Father,  
and  the  Father  in  me;  and  in  me 
hath the Father glorified his name.
16 I came unto my own, and my 
own  a received  me  not.  And  the 
scriptures b concerning my coming 
are fulfilled.

17 And as many as have received 
me, to them have I a given to become 
the sons of God; and even so will I 
to as many as shall believe on my 
name, for behold, by me b redemp-
tion cometh, and c in me is the d law 
of Moses fulfilled.

18 I am the a light and the life of 
the world. I am b Alpha and Omega, 
the beginning and the end.

19 And ye shall offer up unto me 
a no  more  the  shedding  of  blood; 
yea, your sacrifices and your burnt 
offerings shall be done away, for I 
will accept none of your sacrifices 
and your burnt offerings.

20 And ye shall offer for a a sacri-
fice unto me a broken heart and a 
contrite spirit. And whoso cometh 
unto me with a broken heart and a 
contrite spirit, him will I b baptize 
with fire and with the Holy Ghost, 
even as the Lamanites, because of 
their faith in me at the time of their 
conversion, were baptized with fire 
and with the Holy Ghost, and they 
knew it not.

21 Behold, I have come unto the 
world  to  bring  a redemption  unto  
the world, to save the world from sin.

CHAPTER 10
There is silence in the land for many 
hours—The voice of Christ promises to 
gather His people as a hen gathers her 
chickens—The more righteous part of 
the people have been preserved. About 
a.d. 34–35.
And  now  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
that all the people of the land did 
a hear these sayings, and did witness 
of it. And after these sayings there 
was silence in the land for the space 
of many hours;

2 For so great was the astonishment  
of the people that they did cease la-
menting and howling for the loss of  
their kindred which had been slain; 
therefore there was silence in all the 
land for the space of many hours.
3 And it came to pass that there 
came a voice again unto the people, 
and all the people did hear, and did 
witness of it, saying:

4 O ye people of these a great cit-
ies which have fallen, who are de-
scendants of Jacob, yea, who are of 
the house of Israel, how oft have I 
b gathered  you  as  a  hen  gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, and 
have c nourished you.

5 And again, a how oft would I have 
gathered  you  as  a  hen  gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, yea, 
O ye people of the house of Israel, 
who have fallen; yea, O ye people 

of the house of Israel, ye that dwell 
at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; 
yea, how oft would I have gathered 
you as a hen gathereth her chick-
ens, and ye would not.

6 O ye house of Israel whom I have 
a spared, how oft will I gather you 
as  a  hen  gathereth  her  chickens 
under her wings, if ye will repent 
and b return unto me with full pur-
pose of c heart.

7 But  if  not,  O  house  of  Israel, 
the places of your dwellings shall 
become a desolate until the time of 
the  fulfilling  of  the  b covenant  to 
your fathers.

8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
after  the  people  had  heard  these 
words, behold, they began to weep 
and howl a again because of the loss 
of their kindred and friends.

9 And it came to pass that thus did 
the three days pass away. And it was 
in the morning, and the a darkness 
dispersed from off the face of the 
land,  and  the  earth  did  cease  to 
tremble, and the  b rocks did cease 
to rend, and the dreadful groanings 
did cease, and all the tumultuous 
noises did pass away.

10 And  the  earth  did  cleave  to-
gether again, that it stood; and the 
a mourning, and the weeping, and 
the wailing of the people who were 
spared  alive  did  cease;  and  their 
mourning was turned into joy, and 
their lamentations into the b praise 
and  thanksgiving  unto  the  Lord 
Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.

11 And  thus  far  were  the  a scrip-
tures  b fulfilled  which  had  been 
spoken by the prophets.

12 And it was the a more righteous 
part of the people who were saved, 
and it was they who received the

prophets and stoned them not; and it  
was they who had not shed the blood 
of the saints, who were spared—

13 And they were spared and were 
not sunk and buried up in the earth; 
and they were not drowned in the 
depths of the sea; and they were not 
burned by fire, neither were they 
fallen upon and crushed to death; 
and they were not carried away in 
the whirlwind; neither were they 
overpowered by the vapor of smoke 
and of darkness.

14 And now, whoso readeth, let him 
understand; he that hath the scrip-
tures, let him a search them, and see 
and behold if all these deaths and  
destructions by fire, and by smoke, 
and  by  b tempests,  and  by  whirl-
winds, and by the c opening of the 
earth to receive them, and all these 
things  are  not  unto  the  fulfilling 
of  the  prophecies  of  many  of  the  
holy prophets.

15 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Yea, 
many have testified of these things 
at the coming of Christ, and were 
a slain because they testified of these  
things.

16 Yea,  the  prophet  a Zenos  did 
testify  of  these  things,  and  also 
Zenock  spake  b concerning  these 
things, because they testified par-
ticularly concerning us, who are the  
remnant of their seed.

17 Behold,  our  father  Jacob  also 
testified concerning a a remnant of 
the seed of Joseph. And behold, are  
not  we  a  remnant  of  the  seed  of  
Joseph? And these things which tes-
tify of us, are they not written upon 
the plates of brass which our father 
Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

18 And it came to pass that in the 
ending of the thirty and fourth year, 
behold, I will show unto you that the 
people of Nephi who were spared, 
and also those who had been called 

a Lamanites, who had been spared, 
did have great favors shown unto 
them, and great b blessings poured 
out upon their heads, insomuch that 
soon after the c ascension of Christ 
into heaven he did truly manifest 
himself unto them—

19 a Showing his body unto them, 
and  ministering  unto  them;  and 
an account of his ministry shall be 
given hereafter. Therefore for this 
time I make an end of my sayings.

Jesus Christ did show himself unto 
the people of Nephi, as the multi-
tude were gathered together in the 
land  Bountiful,  and  did  minister 
unto them; and on this wise did he 
show himself unto them.

Comprising chapters 11 through 26.

CHAPTER 11
The  Father  testifies  of  His  Beloved 
Son—Christ  appears  and  proclaims 
His  Atonement—The  people  feel  the 
wound  marks  in  His  hands  and  feet 
and side—They cry Hosanna—He sets  
forth the mode and manner of baptism 
—The  spirit  of  contention  is  of  the 
devil—Christ’s  doctrine  is  that  men 
should believe and be baptized and re-
ceive the Holy Ghost. About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that there 
were  a  great  multitude  a gathered 
together,  of  the  people  of  Nephi, 
round about the temple which was 
in  the  land  b Bountiful;  and  they 
were marveling and wondering one 
with another, and were showing one 
to another the  c great and marvel-
ous change which had taken place.
2 And they were also conversing 
about  this  Jesus  Christ,  of  whom 
the a sign had been given concern-
ing his death.

3 And it came to pass that while 
they were thus conversing one with 
another, they heard a a voice as if it 
came out of heaven; and they cast 
their  eyes  round  about,  for  they 
understood  not  the  voice  which 
they heard; and it was not a harsh 
voice, neither was it a loud voice; 
nevertheless, and notwithstanding 
it being a b small voice it did c pierce 
them  that  did  hear  to  the  center, 
insomuch  that  there  was  no  part 
of their frame that it did not cause 
to quake; yea, it did pierce them to 
the very soul, and did cause their 
hearts to burn.

4 And it came to pass that again 
they heard the voice, and they a un-
derstood it not.

5 And again the third time they did 
hear the voice, and did a open their 
ears to hear it; and their eyes were  
towards the sound thereof; and they 
did look steadfastly towards heaven, 
from whence the sound came.

6 And behold, the third time they 
did  understand  the  voice  which 
they heard; and it said unto them:
7 Behold  my  a Beloved  Son,  b in 
whom I am well pleased, in whom 
I  have  glorified  my  name—hear 
ye him.

8 And it came to pass, as they un-
derstood  they  cast  their  eyes  up 
again towards heaven; and behold, 
they  a saw  a  Man  b descending  out 
of heaven; and he was clothed in a 
white robe; and he came down and 
stood in the midst of them; and the 
eyes of the whole multitude were 
turned upon him, and they durst 
not open their mouths, even one to  

another, and wist not what it meant, 
for they thought it was an angel that 
had appeared unto them.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
stretched forth his hand and spake 
unto the people, saying:

10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom 
the  prophets  testified  shall  come 
into the world.

11 And  behold,  I  am  the  a light 
and  the  life  of  the  world;  and  I 
have drunk out of that bitter b cup 
which the Father hath given me, and 
have glorified the Father in c taking 
upon me the sins of the world, in 
the which I have suffered the d will 
of the Father in all things from the 
beginning.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had spoken these words the 
whole multitude a fell to the earth; 
for  they  remembered  that  it  had 
been  b prophesied  among  them 
that  Christ  should  c show  himself 
unto them after his ascension into  
heaven.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 

a Lord spake unto them saying:

14 Arise and come forth unto me, 
that  ye  may  a thrust  your  hands 
into my side, and also that ye may 
b feel the prints of the nails in my 
hands and in my feet, that ye may 
know that I am the c God of Israel, 
and  the  God  of  the  whole  d earth, 
and have been slain for the sins of  
the world.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
multitude  went  forth,  and  thrust 
their hands into his side, and a did 
feel  the  prints  of  the  nails  in  his 
hands and in his feet; and this they

did do, going forth one by one un-
til they had all gone forth, and did 
see  with  their  eyes  and  did  feel 
with their hands, and did know of 
a surety and did bear record, that 
it was he, of whom it was written 
by the prophets, that should come.
16 And  when  they  had  all  gone 
forth and had witnessed for them-
selves,  they  did  cry  out  with  one 
accord, saying:

17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name 
of the Most High God! And they did 
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and 
did a worship him.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
spake unto a Nephi (for Nephi was 
among the multitude) and he com-
manded him that he should come 
forth.

19 And Nephi arose and went forth, 
and a bowed himself before the Lord 
and did b kiss his feet.

20 And the Lord commanded him 
that he should a arise. And he arose 
and stood before him.

21 And the Lord said unto him: I 
give unto you a power that ye shall 
b baptize this people when I am again 
ascended into heaven.

22 And again the Lord called a oth-
ers,  and  said  unto  them  likewise; 
and  he  gave  unto  them  power  to 
baptize. And he said unto them: On 
this wise shall ye baptize; and there 
shall be b no disputations among you.
23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso 
repenteth of his sins through your 
a words, and b desireth to be baptized 

in my name, on this wise shall ye 
baptize them—Behold, ye shall go 
down and c stand in the water, and 
in my name shall ye baptize them.
24 And now behold, these are the 
words  which  ye  shall  say,  calling 
them by name, saying:

25 Having a authority given me of 
Jesus  Christ,  I  baptize  you  in  the 
name of the b Father, and of the Son,  
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

26 And  then  shall  ye  a immerse 
them in the water, and come forth 
again out of the water.

27 And after this manner shall ye 
a baptize in my name; for behold, ver-
ily I say unto you, that the Father, 
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are 
b one; and I am in the Father, and 
the  Father  in  me,  and  the  Father 
and I are one.

28 And according as I have com-
manded you thus shall ye baptize. 
And there shall be no a disputations 
among you, as there have hitherto 
been; neither shall there be dispu-
tations among you concerning the 
points of my doctrine, as there have 
hitherto been.

29 For verily, verily I say unto you, 
he that hath the spirit of a conten-
tion is not of me, but is of the b devil, 
who is the father of contention, and 
he  stirreth  up  the  hearts  of  men 
to  contend  with  anger,  one  with  
another.

is  my  doctrine,  that  such  things 
a should be done away.

31 Behold,  verily,  verily,  I  say 
unto  you,  I  will  declare  unto  you 
my a doctrine.

32 And this is my  a doctrine, and 
it is the doctrine which the Father 
hath  given  unto  me;  and  I  bear 
b record of the Father, and the Father 
beareth record of me, and the c Holy 
Ghost beareth record of the Father 
and me; and I bear record that the 
Father commandeth all men, every-
where, to repent and believe in me.
33 And  whoso  believeth  in  me, 
and is a baptized, the same shall be 
b saved; and they are they who shall 
c inherit the kingdom of God.

34 And  whoso  believeth  not  in 
me, and is not  a baptized, shall be 
damned.

35 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that this is my doctrine, and I bear 
record  of  it  from  the  Father;  and 
whoso  a believeth  in  me  believeth  
in  the  Father  also;  and  unto  him 
will the Father bear record of me, 
for he will visit him b with fire and 
with the c Holy Ghost.

36 And thus will the Father bear 
record of me, and the a Holy Ghost 
will  bear  record  unto  him  of  the 
Father and me; for the Father, and 
I, and the Holy Ghost are b one.

37 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  ye 
must repent, and a become as a b little  
child, and be baptized in my name, 
or ye can in nowise receive these 
things.

38 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  ye 
must repent, and be baptized in my 

name, and become as a little a child, 
or  ye  can  in  nowise  inherit  the  
kingdom of God.

39 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that this is my a doctrine, and whoso 
b buildeth upon this buildeth upon 
my rock, and the c gates of hell shall 
not prevail against them.

40 And whoso shall a declare more 
or  less  than  this,  and  establish  it 
for my doctrine, the same cometh 
of  evil,  and  is  not  built  upon  my 
rock; but he buildeth upon a b sandy 
foundation,  and  the  gates  of  hell 
stand  open  to  receive  such  when 
the floods come and the winds beat  
upon them.

41 Therefore,  go  forth  unto  this 
people, and declare the words which 
I  have  spoken,  unto  the  ends  of  
the earth.

CHAPTER 12
Jesus calls and commissions the twelve 
disciples—He delivers to the Nephites a 
discourse similar to the Sermon on the 
Mount—He speaks the Beatitudes—His 
teachings  transcend  and  take  prece-
dence over the law of Moses—Men are 
commanded  to  be  perfect  even  as  He 
and His Father are perfect—Compare 
Matthew 5. About a.d. 34.
a And  it  came  to  pass  that  when 
Jesus had spoken these words unto 
Nephi, and to those who had been

who had been called, and received

and cried unto them, saying: d Blessed 
are ye if ye shall give heed unto the 
words of these twelve whom I have 
e chosen from among you to minis-
ter  unto  you,  and  to  be  your  ser-
vants; and unto them I have given 
power that they may baptize you 
with  water;  and  after  that  ye  are 
baptized with water, behold, I will 
baptize you with fire and with the 
Holy  Ghost;  therefore  blessed  are 
ye if ye shall believe in me and be 
baptized, after that ye have seen me  
and know that I am.

who  shall  a believe  in  your  words 
because  that  ye  shall  testify  that 
ye have seen me, and that ye know 
that I am. Yea, blessed are they who 
shall  b believe in your  c words, and 
d come down into the depths of hu-
mility  and  be  baptized,  for  they 
shall be visited e with fire and with 
the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a 
remission of their sins.

3 Yea, blessed are the a poor in spirit 
who  b come  unto  me,  for  theirs  is 
the kingdom of heaven.

4 And again, blessed are all they that  
a mourn, for they shall be b comforted.
5 And blessed are the a meek, for 

they shall inherit the b earth.

6 And  blessed  are  all  they  who 
do a hunger and b thirst after c righ-
teousness, for they shall be d filled 
with the Holy Ghost.

7 And  blessed  are  the  a merciful, 

for they shall obtain mercy.

8 And blessed are all the a pure in 

heart, for they shall b see God.

9 And blessed are all the a peace-
makers, for they shall be called the 
b children of God.

10 And blessed are all they who 
are a persecuted for my name’s sake, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 And blessed are ye when men 
shall a revile you and persecute, and 
shall say all manner of evil against 
you falsely, for my sake;

12 For a ye shall have great joy and 
be exceedingly glad, for great shall 
be your  b reward in heaven; for so 
c persecuted they the prophets who 
were before you.

13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I 
give unto you to be the a salt of the 
earth; but if the salt shall lose its 
savor wherewith shall the earth be 
salted? The salt shall be thenceforth 
good for nothing, but to be cast out  
and to be trodden under foot of men.
14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I 
give unto you to be the light of this 
people. A city that is set on a hill 
cannot be hid.

15 Behold, do men light a a candle 
and put it under a bushel? Nay, but 
on a candlestick, and it giveth light 
to all that are in the house;

16 Therefore  let  your  a light  so 
shine before this people, that they 
may see your good works and b glo-
rify your Father who is in heaven.
17 Think  not  that  I  am  come  to 
destroy  the  law  or  the  prophets.

I  am  not  come  to  destroy  but  to  
fulfil;

18 For verily I say unto you, a one 
jot nor one tittle hath not passed 
away  from  the  b law,  but  in  me  it 
hath all been fulfilled.

19 And behold, I have given you 
the  law  and  the  commandments 
of my Father, that ye shall believe 
in me, and that ye shall repent of 
your sins, and come unto me with a 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 
Behold,  ye  have  the  command-
ments before you, and the b law is  
fulfilled.

20 Therefore a come unto me and 
be  ye  saved;  for  verily  I  say  unto 
you, that except ye shall keep my 
b commandments, which I have com-
manded you at this time, ye shall 
in no case enter into the kingdom 
of heaven.

21 Ye have heard that it hath been 
said by them of old time, and it is 
also written before you, that thou 
shalt not a kill, and whosoever shall 
kill shall be in danger of the judg-
ment of God;

22 But I say unto you, that whoso-
ever is a angry with his brother shall 
be in danger of his judgment. And 
whosoever shall say to his brother, 
Raca,  shall  be  in  danger  of  the 
council;  and  whosoever  shall  say, 
Thou  fool,  shall  be  in  danger  of  
hell fire.

23 Therefore,  a if  ye  shall  come 
unto  me,  or  shall  desire  to  come 
unto me, and rememberest that thy 
brother hath aught against thee—
24 Go thy way unto thy brother, and 
first be a reconciled to thy brother,  

and then come unto me with full 
b purpose  of  heart,  and  I  will  re-
ceive you.

25 a Agree  with  thine  adversary 
quickly while thou art in the way 
with him, lest at any time he shall 
get thee, and thou shalt be cast into  
prison.

26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
thou shalt by no means come out 
thence until thou hast paid the ut-
termost senine. And while ye are in 
prison can ye pay even one a senine? 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.
27 Behold, it is written by them of 
old time, that thou shalt not com-
mit a adultery;

28 But I say unto you, that whoso-
ever looketh on a woman, to  a lust 
after her, hath committed adultery 
already in his heart.

29 Behold, I give unto you a com-
mandment,  that  ye  suffer  a none 
of these things to enter into your 
b heart;

30 For it is better that ye should 
deny  yourselves  of  these  things, 
wherein ye will take up your a cross, 
than  that  ye  should  be  cast  into  
hell.

31 It hath been written, that whoso-
ever shall put away his wife, let him  
give her a writing of a divorcement.
32 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that whosoever shall a put away his 
wife, saving for the cause of  b for-
nication,  causeth  her  to  commit 
c adultery;  and  whoso  shall  marry 
her  who  is  divorced  committeth  
adultery.

shalt b perform unto the Lord thine  
c oaths;

34 But  verily,  verily,  I  say  unto 
you,  a swear  not  at  all;  neither  by 
heaven, for it is God’s throne;

35 Nor  by  the  earth,  for  it  is  his 

footstool;

36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy 
head, because thou canst not make 
one hair black or white;

37 But let your a communication be 
b Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever 
cometh of more than these is evil.
38 And behold, it is written, an a eye 
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
39 But I say unto you, that ye shall 
not a resist evil, but whosoever shall 
smite thee on thy right b cheek, c turn 
to him the other also;

40 And if any man will sue thee at 
the law and take away thy coat, a let  
him have thy cloak also;

41 And  whosoever  shall  compel 
thee to a go a mile, go with him twain.
42 a Give to him that asketh thee, 
and from him that would b borrow 
of thee turn thou not away.

43 And behold it is written also, 
that thou shalt love thy neighbor and  
hate thine enemy;

44 But behold I say unto you, love 
your a enemies, bless them that curse 
you, do b good to them that hate you, 
and c pray for them who despitefully 
use you and persecute you;

45 That ye may be the children of 
your Father who is in heaven; for 
he maketh his sun to rise  a on the 
evil and on the good.

46 Therefore those things which 
were of old time, which were un-
der the law, in me are all a fulfilled.
47 a Old things are done away, and 

all things have become b new.

48 Therefore I would that ye should  
be a perfect even as I, or your Father 
who is in heaven is perfect.

CHAPTER 13
Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s 
Prayer—They are to lay up treasures in 
heaven—The twelve disciples in their 
ministry  are  commanded  to  take  no 
thought for temporal things—Compare 
Matthew 6. About a.d. 34.
a Verily, verily, I say that I would 
that  ye  should  do  alms  unto  the 
poor; but take heed that ye do not 
your alms before men to be seen of 
them; otherwise ye have no reward 
of your Father who is in heaven.

2 Therefore, when ye shall do your 
alms do not sound a trumpet before 
you,  as  will  hypocrites  do  in  the 
synagogues and in the streets, that 
they may have a glory of men. Ver-
ily I say unto you, they have their  
reward.

3 But  when  thou  doest  alms  let 
not  thy  left  hand  know  what  thy 
right hand doeth;

4 That  thine  alms  may  be  in  se-
cret; and thy Father who seeth in 
secret,  himself  shall  reward  thee  
openly.

they love to pray, standing in the 
synagogues  and  in  the  corners  of 
the streets, that they may be seen 
of men. Verily I say unto you, they 
have their reward.

6 But  thou,  when  thou  prayest, 
enter  into  thy  closet,  and  when 
thou  hast  a shut  thy  door,  pray  to 
thy Father who is in secret; and thy 
Father, who b seeth in secret, shall 
reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not a vain 
repetitions, as the b heathen, for they 
think that they shall be heard for 
their much speaking.

8 Be  not  ye  therefore  like  unto 
them,  for  your  Father  a knoweth 
what things ye have need of before 
ye b ask him.

9 After  this  a manner  therefore 
b pray  ye:  Our  c Father  who  art  in 
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy will be done on earth as it 

is in heaven.

11 And forgive us our debts, as we 

forgive our debtors.

12 And a lead us not into tempta-

tion, but deliver us from evil.

13 For thine is the kingdom, and the 
power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
14 For,  if  ye  a forgive  men  their 
trespasses  your  heavenly  Father 
will also forgive you;

15 But if ye forgive not men their 
trespasses neither will your Father 
forgive your trespasses.

16 Moreover, when ye a fast be not 
as the b hypocrites, of a sad counte-
nance, for they disfigure their faces 
that they may appear unto men to 
fast. Verily I say unto you, they have  
their reward.

17 But  thou,  when  thou  fastest, 
anoint thy head, and a wash thy face;
18 That  thou  appear  not  unto  
men to fast, but unto thy Father, who 
is in  a secret; and thy Father, who 
seeth  in  secret,  shall  reward  thee  
openly.

19 Lay not up for yourselves trea-
sures upon earth, where a moth and 
rust doth corrupt, and thieves break 
through and steal;

20 But lay up for yourselves a trea-
sures in heaven, where neither moth 
nor rust doth corrupt, and where 
thieves do not break through nor 
steal.

21 For where your treasure is, there 

will your heart be also.

22 The a light of the body is the b eye; 
if, therefore, thine eye be  c single,  
thy  whole  body  shall  be  full  of  
light.

23 But  if  thine  eye  be  evil,  thy 
whole  body  shall  be  full  of  dark-
ness. If, therefore, the light that is in 
thee be darkness, how great is that  
darkness!

24 No man can a serve b two masters; 
for either he will hate the one and 
love the other, or else he will hold 
to  the  one  and  despise  the  other. 
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.
25 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words 
he looked upon the a twelve whom 
he had chosen, and said unto them: 
Remember the words which I have 
spoken.  For  behold,  ye  are  they 
whom  I  have  chosen  to  b minister 
unto  this  people.  Therefore  I  say 
unto you, c take no thought for your 
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye

shall drink; nor yet for your body, 
what ye shall put on. Is not the life 
more than meat, and the body than 
d raiment?

26 Behold  the  a fowls  of  the  air, 
for  they  sow  not,  neither  do  they 
reap nor gather into barns; yet your 
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are 
ye not much better than they ?

27 Which of you by taking thought 
can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And  why  take  ye  thought  for 
raiment? Consider the a lilies of the 
field how they grow; they toil not, 
neither do they spin;

29 And  yet  I  say  unto  you,  that 
even Solomon, in all his glory, was 
not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the 
grass of the field, which today is, 
and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
even so will he clothe you, if ye are 
not of little faith.

31 Therefore take no thought, say-
ing,  What  shall  we  eat?  or,  What  
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall  
we be clothed?

32 For your heavenly Father know-
eth that ye have need of all these 
things.

33 But a seek ye first the b kingdom  
of God and his righteousness, and 
all  these  things  shall  be  added 
unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for 
the morrow, for the morrow shall 
take  thought  for  the  things  of  it-
self. a Sufficient is the day unto the 
evil thereof.

CHAPTER 14

Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God; 
beware  of  false  prophets—He  prom-
ises salvation to those who do the will 
of  the  Father—Compare  Matthew  7. 
About a.d. 34.
a And now it came to pass that when 

Jesus  had  spoken  these  words  he 
turned  again  to  the  multitude, 
and did open his mouth unto them 
again,  saying:  Verily,  verily,  I  say 
unto you, Judge not, that ye be not  
judged.

2 a For  with  what  judgment  ye 
judge, ye shall be judged; and with 
what measure ye mete, it shall be 
measured to you again.

3 And  why  beholdest  thou  the 
mote  that  is  in  thy  brother’s  eye, 
but considerest not the beam that 
is in thine own eye?

4 Or  how  wilt  thou  say  to  thy 
brother: Let me pull the mote out 
of thine eye—and behold, a beam 
is in thine own eye?

5 Thou  a hypocrite,  first  cast  the 
b beam  out  of  thine  own  eye;  and 
then shalt thou see clearly to cast the  
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6 Give  not  that  which  is  a holy 
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your 
pearls before swine, lest they tram-
ple them under their feet, and turn 
again and rend you.

7 a Ask, and it shall be given unto 
you; b seek, and ye shall find; knock, 
and it shall be opened unto you.

8 For every one that asketh, receiv-
eth; and he that seeketh, findeth; 
and to him that knocketh, it shall 
be opened.

9 Or  what  man  is  there  of  you, 
who, if his son ask bread, will give 
him a stone?

10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give 

him a serpent?

11 If ye then, being evil, know how 
to  give  good  gifts  unto  your  chil-
dren,  how  much  more  shall  your 
Father who is in heaven give good 
things to them that ask him?

12 Therefore, all things whatsoever 
ye  would  that  men  should  do  to  
you, a do ye even so to them, for this 
is the law and the prophets.

13 Enter ye in at the a strait gate; 
for wide is the gate, and b broad is

doeth the will of my Father who is 
in heaven.

22 Many will a say to me in that day: 
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
in thy name, and in thy name have 
cast  out  devils,  and  in  thy  name 
done many wonderful works?

23 And then will  a I profess unto 
them:  I  never  b knew  you;  c depart 
from me, ye that work iniquity.

24 Therefore, whoso heareth these 
sayings  of  mine  and  doeth  them, 

I will liken him unto a wise man, 
who built his house upon a a rock—
25 And the a rain descended, and 
the floods came, and the winds blew, 
and  beat  upon  that  house;  and  it 
b fell not, for it was founded upon  
a rock.

26 And  every  one  that  heareth 
these  sayings  of  mine  and  doeth 
them  not  shall  be  likened  unto  a 
a foolish man, who built his house 
upon the b sand—

27 And  the  rain  descended,  and 
the  floods  came,  and  the  winds 
blew, and beat upon that house; and 
it fell, and great was the fall of it.

CHAPTER 15
Jesus announces that the law of Moses 
is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are 
the other sheep of whom He spoke in 
Jerusalem—Because  of  iniquity,  the 
Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know 
of the scattered sheep of Israel. About  
a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  ended  these  sayings  he 
cast  his  eyes  round  about  on  the 
multitude,  and  said  unto  them: 
Behold,  ye  have  heard  the  things 
which I a taught before I ascended 
to my Father; therefore, whoso re-
membereth these sayings of mine 
and b doeth them, him will I c raise 
up at the last day.

2 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had said these words he per-
ceived that there were some among 
them who marveled, and wondered 
what he would concerning the law

of Moses; for they understood not 
the  saying  that  a old  things  had 
passed  away,  and  that  all  things 
had become new.

3 And he said unto them: Marvel 
not  that  I  said  unto  you  that  old 
things had passed away, and that 
all things had become a new.

4 Behold, I say unto you that the 
a law is fulfilled that was given unto 
Moses.

5 Behold,  a I  am  he  that  gave  the 
law,  and  I  am  he  who  covenanted 
with  my  people  Israel;  therefore, 
the law in me is fulfilled, for I have 
come to b fulfil the law; therefore it 
hath an end.

6 Behold,  I  do  a not  destroy  the 
prophets, for as many as have not 
been fulfilled in me, verily I say unto  
you, shall all be fulfilled.

7 And because I said unto you that 
old things have passed away, I do not 
destroy that which hath been spoken  
concerning things which are to come.
8 For behold, the a covenant which 
I have made with my people is not 
all fulfilled; but the law which was 
given unto Moses hath an end in me.
9 Behold, I am the  a law, and the 
b light. Look unto me, and endure to 
the end, and ye shall c live; for unto 
him that d endureth to the end will 
I give eternal life.

10 Behold, I have given unto you 
the a commandments; therefore keep 
my commandments. And this is the 
law and the prophets, for they truly 
b testified of me.

11 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words, 
he  a said  unto  those  twelve  whom 
he had chosen:

12 Ye are my a disciples; and ye are 
a b light unto this people, who are a  
remnant of the house of c Joseph.

13 And behold, this is the a land of 
your  inheritance;  and  the  Father 
hath given it unto you.

14 And not at any time hath the 
Father given me commandment that 
I should a tell it unto your brethren 
at Jerusalem.

15 Neither  at  any  time  hath  the 
Father given me commandment that 
I should tell unto them concerning 
the  a other  tribes  of  the  house  of 
Israel,  whom  the  Father  hath  led 
away out of the land.

16 This much did the Father a com-
mand  me,  that  I  should  tell  unto 
them:

17 That other sheep I have which 
are  not  of  this  fold;  them  also  I 
must bring, and they shall hear my 
voice; and there shall be one fold, 
and one a shepherd.

18 And  now,  because  of  a stiff-
neckedness and b unbelief they c un-
derstood not my word; therefore I 
was commanded to say no more of 
the  d Father concerning this thing 
unto them.

19 But, verily, I say unto you that 
the  Father  hath  commanded  me, 
and I tell it unto you, that ye were 
a separated  from  among  them  be-
cause of their iniquity; therefore it

is  because  of  their  iniquity  that 
they know not of you.

20 And verily, I say unto you again 
that the other tribes hath the Father 
separated from them; and it is be-
cause  of  their  iniquity  that  they 
know not of them.

21 And verily I say unto you, that 
ye are they of whom I said: a Other 
sheep I have which are not of this 
fold;  them  also  I  must  bring,  and 
they shall hear my voice; and there 
shall be one fold, and one b shepherd.
22 And they understood me not, 
for they supposed it had been the 
a Gentiles; for they understood not 
that  the  Gentiles  should  be  b con-
verted through their preaching.

23 And  they  understood  me  not 
that I said they shall hear my voice; 
and  they  understood  me  not  that 
the a Gentiles should not at any time 
hear  my  voice—that  I  should  not 
manifest myself unto them save it 
were by the b Holy Ghost.

24 But behold, ye have both heard 
a my voice, and seen me; and ye are 
my  sheep,  and  ye  are  numbered 
among those whom the Father hath 
b given me.

CHAPTER 16

Jesus will visit others of the lost sheep 
of Israel—In the latter days the gospel 
will go to the Gentiles and then to the 
house of Israel—The Lord’s people will 
see  eye  to  eye  when  He  brings  again 
Zion. About a.d. 34.
And  verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you 
that I have a other sheep, which are 
not of this land, neither of the land 

of Jerusalem, neither in any parts 
of that land round about whither 
I have been to minister.

2 For  they  of  whom  I  speak  are 
they who have not as yet heard my 
voice;  neither  have  I  at  any  time 
manifested myself unto them.

3 But I have received a a command-
ment of the Father that I shall go 
unto them, and that they shall b hear 
my voice, and shall be numbered 
among my sheep, that there may be 
one fold and one shepherd; there-
fore I go to show myself unto them.
4 And I command you that ye shall 
a write these sayings after I am gone, 
that  if  it  so  be  that  my  people  at 
Jerusalem, they who have seen me 
and been with me in my ministry, 
do not ask the Father in my name, 
that they may receive a knowledge 
of you by the Holy Ghost, and also 
of the other tribes whom they know 
not of, that these sayings which ye 
shall write shall be kept and shall 
be manifested unto the  b Gentiles, 
that through the fulness of the Gen-
tiles, the remnant of their seed, who 
shall  be  scattered  forth  upon  the 
face of the earth because of their 
c unbelief,  may  be  brought  in,  or 
may  be  brought  to  a  d knowledge 
of me, their Redeemer.

5 And then will I a gather them in 
from the four quarters of the earth; 
and then will I fulfil the b covenant 
which the Father hath made unto 
all the people of the c house of Israel.
6 And  blessed  are  the  a Gentiles, 
because of their belief in me, in and 
of the Holy Ghost, which b witnesses 
unto them of me and of the Father.

3 NEPHI 16  : 7–16

7 Behold, because of their belief 
in me, saith the Father, and because 
of the unbelief of you, O house of 
Israel, in the  a latter day shall the 
truth come unto the b Gentiles, that 
the fulness of these things shall be 
made known unto them.

8 But wo, saith the Father, unto the 
a unbelieving  of  the  Gentiles—for 
notwithstanding  they  have  come 
forth  upon  the  face  of  this  land, 
and have b scattered my people who 
are of the house of Israel; and my 
people who are of the house of Is-
rael have been c cast out from among 
them, and have been trodden under 
feet by them;

9 And because of the mercies of the 
Father unto the Gentiles, and also 
the judgments of the Father upon 
my people who are of the house of 
Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, 
that after all this, and I have caused 
my people who are of the house of 
Israel to be smitten, and to be af-
flicted, and to be a slain, and to be 
cast out from among them, and to 
become b hated by them, and to be-
come a hiss and a byword among 
them—

10 And  thus  commandeth  the 
Father that I should say unto you: 
At that day when the Gentiles shall 
a sin against my gospel, and shall re-
ject the fulness of my gospel, and 
shall be  b lifted up in the pride of 
their hearts above all nations, and 
above all the people of the whole 
earth, and shall be filled with all 
manner  of  lyings,  and  of  deceits, 
and  of  mischiefs,  and  all  manner  

of  hypocrisy,  and  c murders,  and 
d priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and 
of secret abominations; and if they 
shall do all those things, and shall 
e reject  the  fulness  of  my  gospel, 
behold,  saith  the  Father,  I  will 
bring the fulness of my gospel from 
among them.

11 And then will I a remember my 
covenant which I have made unto 
my people, O house of Israel, and 
I will bring my gospel unto them.
12 And I will show unto thee, O 
house  of  Israel,  that  the  Gentiles 
shall not have power over you; but 
I will remember my covenant unto 
you, O house of Israel, and ye shall 
come  unto  the  a knowledge  of  the 
fulness of my gospel.

13 But if the Gentiles will repent 
and  return  unto  me,  saith  the 
Father, behold they shall be a num-
bered among my people, O house  
of Israel.

14 And I will not suffer my people, 
who are of the house of Israel, to 
go through among them, and tread 
them down, saith the Father.

15 But if they will not turn unto 
me, and hearken unto my voice, I 
will suffer them, yea, I will suffer 
my people, O house of Israel, that 
they shall go through among them, 
and  shall  a tread  them  down,  and 
they shall be as salt that hath lost 
its savor, which is thenceforth good 
for nothing but to be cast out, and 
to  be  trodden  under  foot  of  my 
people, O house of Israel.

16 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
thus hath the Father commanded

me—that  I  should  give  unto  a this 
people  this  land  for  their  inheri-
tance.

17 And  then  the  a words  of  the 
prophet  Isaiah  shall  be  fulfilled, 
which say:

18 a Thy  b watchmen  shall  lift  up 
the voice; with the voice together 
shall  they  sing,  for  they  shall  see 
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring 
again Zion.

19 Break  forth  into  joy,  sing  to-
gether, ye waste places of Jerusalem; 
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

20 The Lord hath made bare his 
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of God.

CHAPTER 17

Jesus directs the people to ponder His 
words  and  pray  for  understanding—
He heals their sick—He prays for the 
people, using language that cannot be 
written—Angels  minister  to  and  fire 
encircles their little ones. About a.d. 34.

Behold, now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words 
he looked round about again on the 
multitude, and he said unto them: 
Behold, my a time is at hand.

2 I  a perceive  that  ye  are  weak, 
that ye cannot b understand all my 
words which I am commanded of 
the  Father  to  speak  unto  you  at 
this time.

3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, 
and a ponder upon the things which 
I have said, and ask of the Father, in 
my name, that ye may understand,  

and  b prepare  your  minds  for  the 
c morrow, and I come unto you again.
4 But now I  a go unto the Father, 
and also to b show myself unto the 
lost tribes of Israel, for they are not 
c lost unto the Father, for he knoweth 
whither he hath taken them.

5 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his 
eyes  round  about  again  on  the 
multitude,  and  beheld  they  were 
a in tears, and did look steadfastly 
upon  him  as  if  they  would  ask 
him  to  tarry  a  little  longer  with  
them.

6 And he said unto them: Behold, 
my bowels are filled with a compas-
sion towards you.

7 Have ye any that are a sick among 
you?  Bring  them  hither.  Have  ye 
any that are lame, or blind, or halt, 
or maimed, or b leprous, or that are 
withered, or that are deaf, or that 
are afflicted in any manner? Bring 
them hither and I will c heal them, 
for  I  have  compassion  upon  you; 
my bowels are filled with mercy.

8 For I perceive that ye desire that  
I should show unto you what I have 
done  unto  your  brethren  at  Jeru-
salem, for I see that your  a faith is 
b sufficient that I should heal you.

9 And it came to pass that when he 
had thus spoken, all the multitude, 
with one accord, did go forth with 
their sick and their afflicted, and 
their lame, and with their  a blind, 
and with their dumb, and with all 
them  that  were  afflicted  in  any 
manner; and he did heal them ev-
ery one as they were brought forth  
unto him.

10 And they did all, both they who 
had been healed and they who were 
whole, bow down at his feet, and 
did worship him; and as many as 
could come for the multitude did 
a kiss his feet, insomuch that they 
did bathe his feet with their tears.
11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
commanded that their a little chil-
dren should be brought.

12 So  they  brought  their  little 
children and set them down upon 
the ground round about him, and 
Jesus  stood  in  the  midst;  and  the 
multitude  gave  way  till  they  had 
all been brought unto him.

they had all been brought, and Jesus 
stood in the midst, he commanded 
the  multitude  that  they  should 
a kneel down upon the ground.

14 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  knelt  upon  the  ground, 
Jesus groaned within himself, and 
said: Father, I am a troubled because 
of the wickedness of the people of 
the house of Israel.

15 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, he himself also a knelt upon 
the  earth;  and  behold  he  b prayed 
unto  the  Father,  and  the  things 
which he prayed cannot be written, 
and the multitude did bear record 
who heard him.

16 And after this manner do they 
bear  record:  The  a eye  hath  never 
seen,  neither  hath  the  ear  heard, 
before,  so  great  and  marvelous 
things as we saw and heard Jesus 
speak unto the Father;

17 And no a tongue can speak, nei-
ther  can  there  be  written  by  any 
man, neither can the hearts of men 
conceive  so  great  and  marvelous 
things  as  we  both  saw  and  heard 

Jesus speak; and no one can conceive 
of the joy which filled our souls at 
the time we heard him pray for us 
unto the Father.

18 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of praying 
unto  the  Father,  he  arose;  but  so 
great was the a joy of the multitude 
that they were overcome.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus 
spake  unto  them,  and  bade  them 
arise.

20 And they arose from the earth, 
and he said unto them: Blessed are 
ye because of your faith. And a now 
behold, my joy is full.

21 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, he a wept, and the multitude 
bare record of it, and he took their 
little  children,  one  by  one,  and 
b blessed them, and prayed unto the 
Father for them.

22 And when he had done this he 

wept again;

23 And he spake unto the multi-
tude, and said unto them: Behold 
your little ones.

24 And  as  they  looked  to  behold 
they cast their eyes towards heaven, 
and they saw the heavens open, and 
they saw angels descending out of 
heaven as it were in the midst of fire; 
and they came down and a encircled 
those  little  ones  about,  and  they 
were encircled about with fire; and 
the angels did minister unto them.
25 And the multitude did see and 
a hear  and  bear  record;  and  they 
know that their record is true for 
they all of them did see and hear, 
every  man  for  himself;  and  they 
were  in  number  about  two  thou-
sand and five hundred souls; and 
they  did  consist  of  men,  women, 
and children.

CHAPTER 18

Jesus institutes the sacrament among 
the Nephites—They are commanded to 
pray always in His name—Those who 
eat His flesh and drink His blood un-
worthily are damned—The disciples are 
given power to confer the Holy Ghost. 
About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that Jesus com-
manded  his  disciples  that  they 
should bring forth some a bread and 
wine unto him.

2 And  while  they  were  gone  for 
bread  and  wine,  he  commanded 
the multitude that they should sit 
themselves down upon the earth.

3 And when the disciples had come 
with  a bread and wine, he took of 
the bread and brake and blessed it; 
and he gave unto the disciples and 
commanded that they should eat.

4 And when they had eaten and 
were  filled,  he  commanded  that 
they should give unto the multitude.
5 And  when  the  multitude  had 
eaten and were filled, he said unto 
the disciples: Behold there shall one 
be  a ordained  among  you,  and  to 
him will I give power that he shall 
b break c bread and bless it and give 
it unto the people of my  d church, 
unto all those who shall believe and 
be baptized in my name.

6 And this shall ye always observe 
to a do, even as I have done, even as 
I have broken bread and blessed it 
and given it unto you.

7 And this shall ye do in a remem-
brance of my b body, which I have 
shown  unto  you.  And  it  shall  be 
a  testimony  unto  the  Father  that  
ye do always remember me. And if ye  
do  always  remember  me  ye  shall 
have my Spirit to be with you.

8 And it came to pass that when 

he said these words, he commanded 
his disciples that they should take 
of the a wine of the cup and drink 
of it, and that they should also give 
unto the multitude that they might 
drink of it.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did so, and did drink of it and were 
filled; and they gave unto the mul-
titude, and they did drink, and they 
were filled.

10 And  when  the  disciples  had 
done  this,  Jesus  said  unto  them: 
Blessed are ye for this thing which 
ye have done, for this is fulfilling 
my commandments, and this doth 
witness unto the Father that ye are 
a willing  to  do  that  which  I  have 
commanded you.

11 And this shall ye always do to 
those who repent and are baptized 
in my name; and ye shall do it in 
a remembrance of my b blood, which 
I  have  shed  for  you,  that  ye  may 
witness unto the Father that ye do 
always  remember  me.  And  if  ye  
do  always  remember  me  ye  shall 
have my Spirit to be with you.

12 And  I  give  unto  you  a  com-
mandment  that  ye  shall  do  these 
things.  And  if  ye  shall  always  do 
these things blessed are ye, for ye 
are built upon my a rock.

13 But  whoso  among  you  shall 
do a more or less than these are not 
built upon my rock, but are built 
upon a sandy foundation; and when 
the rain descends, and the floods 
come, and the winds blow, and beat 
upon them, they shall b fall, and the 
c gates of hell are ready open to re-
ceive them.

14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye 
shall  keep  my  commandments, 
which the Father hath commanded 
me that I should give unto you.

3 NEPHI 18  : 15–30

15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye 
must watch and a pray always, lest 
ye be tempted by the devil, and ye 
be led away captive by him.

16 And  as  I  have  prayed  among 
you  even  so  shall  ye  pray  in  my 
a church,  among  my  people  who 
do repent and are baptized in my 
name. Behold I am the b light; I have 
set an c example for you.

17 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had spoken these words unto 
his disciples, he turned again unto 
the multitude and said unto them:
18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto 
you, ye must watch and pray always 
lest  ye  enter  into  temptation;  for 
a Satan  desireth  to  have  you,  that 
he may sift you as wheat.

19 Therefore ye must always pray 

unto the Father in my name;

20 And  a whatsoever  ye  shall  ask 
the  Father  in  my  name,  which  is 
right, believing that ye shall receive, 
behold it shall be given unto you.
21 a Pray in your families unto the 
Father,  always  in  my  name,  that 
your wives and your children may 
be blessed.

22 And behold, ye shall a meet to-
gether oft; and ye shall not forbid 
any  man  from  coming  unto  you 
when  ye  shall  meet  together,  but 
suffer  them  that  they  may  come 
unto you and forbid them not;

23 But ye shall a pray for them, and 
shall not cast them out; and if it so 
be that they come unto you oft ye 
shall pray for them unto the Father, 
in my name.

24 Therefore, hold up your a light 

that it may shine unto the world. 
Behold  I  am  the  b light  which  ye 
shall hold up—that which ye have 
seen  me  do.  Behold  ye  see  that  I 
have prayed unto the Father, and 
ye all have witnessed.

25 And  ye  see  that  I  have  com-
manded that a none of you should go 
away, but rather have commanded 
that ye should come unto me, that 
ye might b feel and see; even so shall 
ye do unto the world; and whoso-
ever breaketh this commandment 
suffereth  himself  to  be  led  into 
temptation.

26 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words, 
he turned his eyes again upon the 
a disciples whom he had chosen, and 
said unto them:

27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto 
you, I give unto you another com-
mandment,  and  then  I  must  go 
unto my  a Father that I may fulfil 
b other  commandments  which  he 
hath given me.

28 And  now  behold,  this  is  the 
commandment  which  I  give  unto 
you,  that  ye  shall  not  suffer  any 
one  knowingly  to  a partake  of  my 
flesh and blood b unworthily, when 
ye shall minister it;

29 For whoso eateth and drinketh 
my  flesh  and  a blood  b unworthily 
eateth and drinketh damnation to 
his soul; therefore if ye know that 
a man is unworthy to eat and drink 
of my flesh and blood ye shall for-
bid him.

30 Nevertheless, ye shall not a cast 
him  out  from  among  you,  but  ye

shall b minister unto him and shall 
pray  for  him  unto  the  Father,  in 
my name; and if it so be that he re-
penteth and is baptized in my name, 
then shall ye receive him, and shall 
minister unto him of my flesh and  
blood.

31 But  if  he  repent  not  he  shall 
not be numbered among my people, 
that he may not destroy my people, 
for behold I a know b my sheep, and 
they are numbered.

32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast 
him  out  of  your  a synagogues,  or 
your  places  of  worship,  for  unto 
such shall ye continue to minister; 
for ye know not but what they will 
return and repent, and come unto 
me with full purpose of heart, and 
I shall b heal them; and ye shall be 
the  means  of  bringing  salvation  
unto them.

33 Therefore, keep these sayings 
which I have commanded you that 
ye come not under a condemnation; 
for wo unto him whom the Father 
condemneth.

34 And I give you these command-
ments because of the disputations 
which have been among you. And 
blessed are ye if ye have a no dispu-
tations among you.

35 And now I go unto the Father, 
because it is expedient that I should 
go unto the Father a for your sakes.
36 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of these say-
ings, he touched with his a hand the 
b disciples whom he had chosen, one 
by one, even until he had touched 
them all, and spake unto them as 
he touched them.

37 And  the  multitude  heard  not 
the words which he spake, therefore 
they did not bear record; but the 
disciples bare record that he gave  

them a power to give the b Holy Ghost. 
And I will show unto you c hereafter 
that this record is true.

38 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had touched them all, there 
came  a  a cloud  and  overshadowed 
the multitude that they could not 
see Jesus.

39 And while they were overshad-
owed he a departed from them, and 
ascended into heaven. And the dis-
ciples saw and did bear record that 
he ascended again into heaven.

CHAPTER 19
The twelve disciples minister unto the 
people and pray for the Holy Ghost—
The disciples are baptized and receive 
the Holy Ghost and the ministering of 
angels—Jesus prays using words that 
cannot  be  written—He  attests  to  the 
exceedingly great faith of these Neph-
ites. About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  ascended  into  heaven, 
the  multitude  did  disperse,  and  
every man did take his wife and his  
children and did return to his own 
home.

2 And it was noised abroad among 
the people immediately, before it 
was yet dark, that the multitude had 
seen Jesus, and that he had minis-
tered unto them, and that he would 
also show himself on the a morrow 
unto the multitude.

3 Yea, and even all the night it was 
noised abroad concerning Jesus; and 
insomuch did they send forth unto 
the people that there were many, 
yea, an exceedingly great number, 
did labor exceedingly all that night, 
that they might be on the morrow in 
the place where Jesus should show  
himself unto the multitude.

4 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow,  when  the  multitude  was 
gathered  together,  behold,  Nephi 
and his a brother whom he had raised 
from  the  b dead,  whose  name  was 
Timothy,  and  also  his  son,  whose 
name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, 
and Mathonihah, his brother, and 
Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jere-
miah,  and  Shemnon,  and  Jonas, 
and  Zedekiah,  and  Isaiah—now 
these were the c names of the d dis-
ciples  whom  Jesus  had  chosen—
and it came to pass that they went 
forth and stood in the midst of the  
multitude.

5 And behold, the multitude was 
a so great that they did cause that 
they should be separated into twelve 
bodies.

6 And  the  twelve  did  teach  the 
multitude;  and  behold,  they  did 
cause  that  the  multitude  should 
a kneel down upon the face of the 
earth,  and  should  pray  unto  the 
Father in the name of Jesus.

7 And the disciples did pray unto 
the Father also in the name of Jesus. 
And it came to pass that they arose 
and ministered unto the people.

8 And when they had ministered 
those same words which Jesus had 
spoken—nothing varying from the 
words which Jesus had spoken—be-
hold, they knelt again and prayed 
to the Father in the name of Jesus.
9 And they did pray for that which 
they most desired; and they desired 
that the a Holy Ghost should be given 
unto them.

10 And when they had thus prayed 
they  went  down  unto  the  water’s 
edge, and the multitude followed 
them.

11 And it came to pass that Nephi 
went down a into the water and was 
b baptized.

12 And  he  came  up  out  of  the  

water  and  began  to  baptize.  And 
he baptized all those whom Jesus 
had chosen.

13 And it came to pass when they 
were all baptized and had come a up 
out  of  the  water,  the  b Holy  Ghost 
did fall upon them, and they were 
filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost  and  
with fire.

14 And  behold,  they  were  a en-
circled about as if it were by fire; 
and it came down from heaven, and 
the multitude did witness it, and did 
bear record; and angels did come  
down out of heaven and did min-
ister unto them.

15 And it came to pass that while 
the  angels  were  ministering  unto 
the  disciples,  behold,  Jesus  came 
and stood in the midst and minis-
tered unto them.

16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
spake  unto  the  multitude,  and 
commanded them that they should 
kneel down again upon the earth, 
and also that his disciples should 
kneel down upon the earth.

17 And it came to pass that when 
they had all knelt down upon the 
earth, he commanded his disciples 
that they should pray.

18 And  behold,  they  began  to  
pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, 
calling  him  their  Lord  and  their 
God.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus 
departed out of the midst of them, 
and  went  a  little  way  off  from  
them  and  a bowed  himself  to  the 
earth, and he said:

20 Father, I thank thee that thou 
hast given the Holy Ghost unto these 
whom I have a chosen; and it is be-
cause  of  their  belief  in  me  that  I 
have chosen them out of the world.
21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt 
give the Holy Ghost unto all them 
that shall believe in their words.

22 Father,  thou  hast  given  them 
the  Holy  Ghost  because  they  be-
lieve  in  a me;  and  thou  seest  that 
they  believe  in  me  because  thou 
hearest them, and they pray unto 
me; and they pray unto me because 
I am with them.

23 And now Father, I  a pray unto 
thee for them, and also for all those 
who shall believe on their words, 
that they may believe in me, that 
I may be in them b as thou, Father, 
art in me, that we may be c one.

24 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  thus  prayed  unto  the 
Father, he came unto his disciples, 
and behold, they did still continue, 
without ceasing, to pray unto him; 
and they did not  a multiply many 
words, for it was given unto them 
what they should  b pray, and they 
were filled with desire.

25 And it came to pass that Jesus 
blessed them as they did pray unto 
him; and his a countenance did smile 
upon  them,  and  the  light  of  his  
b countenance did c shine upon them, 
and behold they were as d white as  
the countenance and also the gar-
ments  of  Jesus;  and  behold  the  
whiteness  thereof  did  exceed  all  
the whiteness, yea, even there could 
be nothing upon earth so white as 
the whiteness thereof.

26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray 
on; nevertheless they did not cease 
to pray.

27 And he turned from them again, 
and went a little way off and bowed 
himself to the earth; and he prayed 
again unto the Father, saying:

28 Father, I thank thee that thou 
hast  a purified those whom I have 
chosen, because of their faith, and 

I pray for them, and also for them 
who shall believe on their words, 
that  they  may  be  purified  in  me, 
through faith on their words, even 
as they are purified in me.

29 Father, I pray not for the world, 
but for those whom thou hast given 
me  a out  of  the  world,  because  of 
their faith, that they may be purified  
in me, that I may be in them as thou, 
Father, art in me, that we may be 
one, that I may be glorified in them.
30 And  when  Jesus  had  spoken 
these  words  he  came  again  unto 
his disciples; and behold they did 
pray  steadfastly,  without  ceasing, 
unto him; and he did smile upon 
them again; and behold they were 
a white, even as Jesus.

31 And it came to pass that he went 
again a little way off and prayed 
unto the Father;

32 And tongue cannot speak the 
words  which  he  prayed,  neither 
can be a written by man the words 
which he prayed.

33 And the multitude did hear and 
do  bear  record;  and  their  a hearts 
were open and they did understand 
in their hearts the words which he 
prayed.

34 Nevertheless, so great and mar-
velous  were  the  words  which  he 
prayed  that  they  cannot  be  writ-
ten,  neither  can  they  be  a uttered  
by man.

35 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of praying 
he came again to the disciples, and 
said unto them: a So great b faith have 
I  never  seen  among  all  the  Jews; 
wherefore  I  could  not  show  unto 
them  so  great  c miracles,  because 
of their d unbelief.

CHAPTER 20
Jesus provides bread and wine miracu-
lously and again administers the sac-
rament unto the people—The remnant 
of Jacob will come to the knowledge of 
the Lord their God and will inherit the 
Americas—Jesus is the prophet like unto 
Moses, and the Nephites are children 
of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s 
people  will  be  gathered  to  Jerusalem. 
About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that he com-
manded  the  multitude  that  they 
should a cease to b pray, and also his 
disciples. And he commanded them 
that they should not cease to pray 
in their hearts.

2 And he commanded them that 
they should arise and stand up upon 
their feet. And they arose up and 
stood upon their feet.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
a brake  b bread  again  and  blessed 
it, and gave to the disciples to eat.
4 And when they had eaten he com-
manded them that they should break  
bread, and give unto the multitude.
5 And when they had given unto 
the  multitude  he  also  gave  them 
wine  to  drink,  and  commanded 
them  that  they  should  give  unto 
the multitude.

6 Now, there had been no a bread, 
neither wine, brought by the dis-
ciples, neither by the multitude;

7 But  he  truly  a gave  unto  them 
bread to eat, and also wine to drink.

8 And he said unto them: He that 
eateth  this  bread  eateth  of  a my 
body to his soul; and he that drink-
eth  of  this  wine  drinketh  of  my 
blood to his soul; and his soul shall 
never hunger nor thirst, but shall  
be filled.

9 Now, when the multitude had all 
eaten and drunk, behold, they were 
filled with the Spirit; and they did 
cry  out  with  one  voice,  and  gave 
glory to Jesus, whom they both saw 
and heard.

10 And it came to pass that when 
they had all given glory unto Jesus, 
he  said  unto  them:  Behold  now  I 
finish  the  commandment  which 
the  Father  hath  commanded  me 
concerning this people, who are a 
remnant of the house of Israel.

11 Ye remember that I spake unto 
you, and said that when the a words 
of b Isaiah should be fulfilled—be-
hold they are written, ye have them 
before you, therefore search them—
12 And  verily,  verily,  I  say  unto 
you, that when they shall be fulfilled 
then  is  the  fulfilling  of  the  a cov-
enant which the Father hath made  
unto his people, O house of Israel.
13 And then shall the a remnants, 
which  shall  be  b scattered  abroad 
upon the face of the earth, be c gath-
ered  in  from  the  east  and  from 
the west, and from the south and 
from the north; and they shall be 
brought  to  the  d knowledge  of  the 
Lord their God, who hath redeemed  
them.

14 And  the  Father  hath  a com-
manded me that I should give unto 
you this b land, for your inheritance.
15 And  I  say  unto  you,  that  if 
the  Gentiles  do  not  a repent  after

the  b blessing which they shall re-
ceive, after they have scattered my  
people—

16 Then shall ye, who are a a rem-
nant of the house of Jacob, go forth 
among them; and ye shall be in the 
midst of them who shall be many; 
and ye shall be among them as a lion 
among the beasts of the forest, and 
as a young b lion among the flocks 
of sheep, who, if he goeth through 
both c treadeth down and teareth in 
pieces, and none can deliver.

17 Thy  hand  shall  be  lifted  up 
upon thine adversaries, and all thine 
enemies shall be cut off.

18 And I will  a gather my people 
together  as  a  man  gathereth  his 
sheaves into the floor.

19 For I will make my a people with 
whom the Father hath covenanted, 
yea, I will make thy b horn iron, and 
I  will  make  thy  hoofs  brass.  And 
thou  shalt  c beat  in  pieces  many  
people; and I will consecrate their 
gain unto the Lord, and their sub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole 
earth.  And  behold,  I  am  he  who 
doeth it.

20 And it shall come to pass, saith 
the Father, that the  a sword of my 
justice shall hang over them at that 
day; and except they repent it shall 
fall  upon  them,  saith  the  Father, 
yea,  even  upon  all  the  nations  of 
the Gentiles.

21 And it shall come to pass that I 
will establish my a people, O house 
of Israel.

22 And behold, this  a people will 

I  establish  in  this  land,  unto  the 
fulfilling of the b covenant which I 
made with your father Jacob; and 
it shall be a c New Jerusalem. And 
the  d powers of heaven shall be in 
the midst of this people; yea, even 
e I will be in the midst of you.

23 Behold, I am he of whom Mo-
ses spake, saying: a A prophet shall  
the  Lord  your  God  raise  up  unto 
you  of  your  brethren,  like  unto 
me; him shall ye hear in all things 
whatsoever he shall say unto you. 
And it shall come to pass that every 
soul who will not hear that prophet 
shall  be  cut  off  from  among  the  
people.

24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and 
a all the prophets from Samuel and 
those that follow after, as many as 
have spoken, have testified of me.
25 And behold, ye are the a children 
of the prophets; and ye are of the 
house  of  Israel;  and  ye  are  of  the 
b covenant which the Father made 
with your fathers, saying unto Abra-
ham: And c in thy seed shall all the 
kindreds of the earth be blessed.

26 The  Father  having  raised  me 
up unto you first, and sent me to 
a bless you in b turning away every 
one of you from his iniquities; and 
this because ye are the children of 
the covenant—

27 And after that ye were blessed 
then fulfilleth the Father the cov-
enant  which  he  made  with  Abra-
ham, saying: a In thy seed shall all the 
kindreds of the earth be blessed—

Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, 
which b blessing upon the c Gentiles 
shall make them mighty above all, 
unto the d scattering of my people, 
O house of Israel.

28 And  they  shall  be  a  a scourge 
unto the people of this land. Nev-
ertheless,  when  they  shall  have 
received the fulness of my gospel, 
then if they shall harden their hearts 
against me I will return their b iniqui-
ties upon their own heads, saith the  
Father.

29 And I will a remember the cov-
enant which I have made with my 
people; and I have covenanted with 
them  that  I  would  b gather  them 
together  in  mine  own  due  time, 
that I would give unto them again 
the c land of their fathers for their 
inheritance,  which  is  the  land  of 
Jerusalem, which is the promised 
land  unto  them  forever,  saith  the  
Father.

30 And it shall come to pass that 
the time cometh, when the fulness 
of  my  gospel  shall  be  preached 
unto them;

31 And they shall a believe in me, 
that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God, and shall pray unto the Father 
in my name.

32 Then shall their a watchmen lift 
up their voice, and with the voice 
together  shall  they  sing;  for  they 
shall see eye to eye.

33 Then  will  the  Father  gather 
them together again, and give unto 
them  a Jerusalem  for  the  b land  of 
their inheritance.

34 Then  shall  they  break  forth 
into joy—a Sing together, ye waste 

places of Jerusalem; for the Father 
hath comforted his people, he hath 
redeemed Jerusalem.

35 The Father hath made bare his 
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth 
shall see the salvation of the Father; 
and the Father and I are one.

36 And then shall be brought to  
pass that which is written: a Awake, 
awake again, and put on thy strength, 
O Zion; put on thy beautiful gar-
ments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, 
for henceforth there shall no more 
come into thee the uncircumcised 
and the unclean.

37 Shake  thyself  from  the  dust; 
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose 
thyself from the bands of thy neck, 
O captive daughter of Zion.

38 For  thus  saith  the  Lord:  Ye 
have  sold  yourselves  for  naught, 
and ye shall be redeemed without  
money.

39 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that  my  people  shall  know  my 
name;  yea,  in  that  day  they  shall 
know that I am he that doth speak.
40 And then shall they say: a How 
beautiful upon the mountains are 
the feet of him that bringeth good 
tidings unto them, that b publisheth 
peace;  that  bringeth  good  tidings 
unto them of good, that publisheth 
salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy 
God reigneth!

41 And then shall a cry go forth: 
a Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from 
thence, touch not that which is b un-
clean; go ye out of the midst of her; 
be  ye  c clean  that  bear  the  vessels  
of the Lord.

42 For  ye  shall  a not  go  out  with 
b haste nor go by flight; for the Lord 
will go before you, and the God of 
Israel shall be your rearward.

43 Behold, my servant shall deal 
prudently; he shall be exalted and 
extolled and be very high.

44 As  many  were  astonished  at 
thee—his  visage  was  so  marred, 
more than any man, and his form 
more than the sons of men—

45 So  shall  he  a sprinkle  many 
nations; the kings shall shut their 
mouths at him, for that which had 
not been told them shall they see; 
and that which they had not heard 
shall they b consider.

46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all 
these things shall surely come, even 
as the Father hath commanded me. 
Then shall this covenant which the 
Father  hath  covenanted  with  his 
people be fulfilled; and then shall 
a Jerusalem be inhabited again with 
my people, and it shall be the land 
of their inheritance.

CHAPTER 21
Israel will be gathered when the Book 
of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles 
will be established as a free people in 
America—They  will  be  saved  if  they 
believe and obey; otherwise, they will 
be  cut  off  and  destroyed—Israel  will 
build the New Jerusalem, and the lost 
tribes will return. About a.d. 34.
And  verily  I  say  unto  you,  I  give 
unto you a a sign, that ye may know 
the  b time when these things shall 
be about to take place—that I shall 
gather in, from their long disper-
sion, my people, O house of Israel, 

and  shall  establish  again  among 
them my Zion;

2 And  behold,  this  is  the  thing 
which  I  will  give  unto  you  for  a 
sign—for verily I say unto you that 
a when  these  things  which  I  de-
clare unto you, and which I shall  
declare unto you hereafter of my-
self, and by the power of the Holy 
Ghost which shall be given unto you 
of the Father, shall be made known  
unto  the  Gentiles  that  they  may 
know concerning this people who 
are a remnant of the house of Jacob, 
and concerning this my people who 
shall be scattered by them;

3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when  
these things shall be made a known 
unto them of the Father, and shall 
come  forth  of  the  Father,  b from 
them unto you;

4 For  it  is  wisdom  in  the  Father 
that they should be established in 
this land, and be set up as a a free 
people by the power of the Father, 
that these things might come forth 
from them unto a remnant of your 
seed,  that  the  b covenant  of  the 
Father may be fulfilled which he 
hath  covenanted  with  his  people, 
O house of Israel;

5 Therefore, when these works and 
the works which shall be wrought 
among  you  hereafter  shall  come 
forth a from the Gentiles, unto your 
b seed which shall dwindle in unbe-
lief because of iniquity;

6 For thus it behooveth the Father 
that it should come forth from the 
a Gentiles, that he may show forth 
his power unto the Gentiles, for this 
cause that the Gentiles, if they will 
not harden their hearts, that they

may repent and come unto me and 
be baptized in my name and know 
of the true points of my doctrine, 
that they may be b numbered among 
my people, O house of Israel;

7 And  when  these  things  come  
to pass that thy a seed shall begin to  
know  these  things—it  shall  be  a 
sign unto them, that they may know  
that the work of the Father hath al-
ready commenced unto the fulfill-
ing of the covenant which he hath 
made unto the people who are of 
the house of Israel.

8 And when that day shall come, it 
shall come to pass that kings shall 
shut their mouths; for that which 
had not been told them shall they 
see;  and  that  which  they  had  not 
heard shall they a consider.

9 For in that day, for my sake shall 
the  Father  a work  a  work,  which 
shall be a great and a  b marvelous 
c work among them; and there shall 
be among them those who will not 
believe it, although a man shall de-
clare it unto them.

10 But behold, the life of my ser-
vant shall be in my hand; therefore 
they shall not hurt him, although he 
shall be a marred because of them.  
Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto  
them  that  b my  wisdom  is  greater 
than the cunning of the devil.

11 Therefore it shall come to pass 
that whosoever will not believe in 
my  words,  who  am  Jesus  Christ, 
which the Father shall cause a him 
to  bring  forth  unto  the  b Gentiles, 
and shall give unto him power that 
he shall bring them forth unto the 
Gentiles, (it shall be done even as 

Moses  said)  they  shall  be  c cut  off 
from among my people who are of 
the covenant.

12 And my people who are a rem-
nant of Jacob shall be among the 
Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as 
a a lion among the beasts of the for-
est, as a young lion among the flocks 
of sheep, who, if he go through both 
treadeth down and teareth in pieces, 
and none can deliver.

13 Their hand shall be lifted up 
upon their a adversaries, and all their 
enemies shall be cut off.

14 Yea,  wo  be  unto  the  Gentiles 
except  they  a repent;  for  it  shall

16 And I will cut off a witchcrafts 
out of thy land, and thou shalt have 
no more soothsayers;

17 Thy a graven images I will also 
cut  off,  and  thy  standing  images 
out of the midst of thee, and thou 
shalt  no  more  worship  the  works 
of thy hands;

out of the midst of thee; so will I 
destroy thy cities.

b cut off from among my people, O 
house of Israel;

21 And I will execute a vengeance 
and b fury upon them, even as upon 
the heathen, such as they have not 
heard.

22 But if they will repent and heark-
en unto my words, and a harden not 
their  hearts,  I  will  b establish  my 
church among them, and they shall 
come in unto the covenant and be 
c numbered among this the remnant 
of Jacob, unto whom I have given 
this land for their d inheritance;

23 And they shall assist my a peo-
ple, the remnant of Jacob, and also 
as  many  of  the  house  of  Israel  as 
shall come, that they may build a 
city, which shall be called the b New 
Jerusalem.

24 And then shall a they assist my 
people that they may be gathered 
in, who are scattered upon all the 
face of the land, in unto the New 
Jerusalem.

25 And  then  shall  the  a power  of 
heaven  come  down  among  them; 
and b I also will be in the midst.

26 And  then  shall  the  work  of 
the Father commence at that day, 
even  a when  this  gospel  shall  be 
preached  among  the  remnant  of 
b this people. Verily I say unto you, 
at  that  day  shall  the  work  of  the 
Father  commence  among  all  the  
dispersed of my people, yea, even the 
tribes which have been c lost, which 
the  Father  hath  led  away  out  of  
Jerusalem.

27 Yea, the work shall commence 
among  all  the  a dispersed  of  my 

people, with the Father to prepare 
the way whereby they may b come 
unto me, that they may call on the 
Father in my name.

28 Yea,  and  then  shall  the  work 
commence, with the Father among 
all  nations  in  preparing  the  way 
whereby his people may be a gath-
ered home to the land of their in-
heritance.

29 And they shall go out from all 
nations; and they shall a not go out 
in b haste, nor go by flight, for I will 
go  before  them,  saith  the  Father, 
and I will be their rearward.

CHAPTER 22

In the last days, Zion and her stakes 
will be established, and Israel will be 
gathered  in  mercy  and  tenderness—
They  will  triumph—Compare  Isaiah 
54. About a.d. 34.
And then shall that which is writ-
ten come to pass: Sing, O a barren, 
thou that didst not bear; break forth 
into b singing, and cry aloud, thou 
that  didst  not  travail  with  child; 
for  more  are  the  children  of  the 
c desolate than the children of the 
married wife, saith the Lord.

2 Enlarge  the  place  of  thy  tent, 
and let them stretch forth the cur-
tains of thy habitations; spare not, 
lengthen thy cords and strengthen 
thy a stakes;

3 For  thou  shalt  break  forth  on 
the right hand and on the left, and 
thy seed shall a inherit the b Gentiles 
and make the desolate cities to be 
inhabited.

4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be 
ashamed;  neither  be  thou  con-
founded, for thou shalt not be put to  
a shame;  for  thou  shalt  forget  the 
b shame of thy youth, and shalt not re-
member the c reproach of thy youth,  
and  shalt  not  remember  the  re-
proach of thy widowhood any more.
5 For thy maker, thy a husband, the 
Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy 
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel— 
the God of the whole earth shall he  
be called.

6 For the Lord hath called thee a as 
a woman forsaken and grieved in 
spirit,  and  a  wife  of  youth,  when 
thou wast refused, saith thy God.
7 For a small moment have I a for-
saken thee, but with great mercies 
will I gather thee.

8 In a little wrath I hid my face 
from thee for a moment, but with 
everlasting  a kindness  will  I  have 
b mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy 
Redeemer.

9 For  a this,  the  b waters  of  Noah 
unto me, for as I have sworn that 
the waters of Noah should no more 
go over the earth, so have I sworn 
that I would not be wroth with thee.
10 For the a mountains shall depart 
and the hills be removed, but my 
b kindness  shall  not  c depart  from 
thee,  neither  shall  the  covenant 
of my peace be removed, saith the 
Lord that hath mercy on thee.

11 O  thou  afflicted,  tossed  with 
tempest, and not comforted! Behold, 
I will lay thy a stones with fair col-
ors, and lay thy foundations with 
sapphires.

12 And I will make thy windows 
of agates, and thy gates of carbun-

cles, and all thy borders of pleasant  
stones.

13 And a all thy children shall be 
taught of the Lord; and great shall 
be the b peace of thy children.

14 In a righteousness shalt thou be 
established; thou shalt be far from 
oppression for thou shalt not fear, 
and from terror for it shall not come 
near thee.

15 Behold, they shall surely gather 
together a against thee, not by me; 
whosoever  shall  gather  together 
against thee shall fall for thy sake.
16 Behold, I have created the smith 
that bloweth the coals in the fire, 
and that bringeth forth an instru-
ment for his work; and I have created  
the waster to destroy.

17 No  weapon  that  is  formed 
against thee shall prosper; and every 
tongue that shall revile against thee 
in judgment thou shalt condemn. 
This is the heritage of the a servants 
of the Lord, and their righteousness 
is of me, saith the Lord.

CHAPTER 23
Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—
He commands the people to search the 
prophets—The words of Samuel the La-
manite concerning the Resurrection are 
added to their records. About a.d. 34.
And  now,  behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
that ye ought to a search these things. 
Yea,  a  commandment  I  give  unto 
you that ye search these things dili-
gently; for great are the words of  
b Isaiah.

2 For surely he spake as touching 
all  things  concerning  my  people

a therefore it must needs be that he  
must speak also to the Gentiles.

3 And all things that he spake have 
been and a shall be, even according 
to the words which he spake.

4 Therefore give heed to my words; 
write the things which I have told 
you; and according to the time and 
the will of the Father a they shall go 
forth unto the Gentiles.

5 And  whosoever  will  hearken 
unto my words and repenteth and 
is baptized, the same shall be saved. 
Search the a prophets, for many there 
be that testify of these things.

6 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Jesus had said these words he 
said unto them again, after he had 
expounded all the scriptures unto 
them which they had received, he 
said unto them: Behold, other scrip-
tures I would that ye should write, 
that ye have not.

7 And it came to pass that he said 
unto a Nephi: Bring forth the record 
which ye have kept.

8 And  when  Nephi  had  brought 
forth  the  records,  and  laid  them 
before him, he cast his eyes upon 
them and said:

9 Verily  I  say  unto  you,  I  com-
manded  my  servant  a Samuel,  the 
Lamanite,  that  he  should  testify 
unto  this  people,  that  at  the  day 
that the Father should glorify his 
name in me that there were b many 
c saints who should d arise from the 
dead, and should appear unto many, 
and  should  minister  unto  them. 
And  he  said  unto  them:  Was  it  
not so?

10 And his disciples answered him 
and  said:  Yea,  Lord,  Samuel  did 
prophesy according to thy words, 
and they were all fulfilled.

11 And Jesus said unto them: How 

be it that ye have not a written this 
thing, that many  b saints did arise 
and  appear  unto  many  and  did 
minister unto them?

12 And it came to pass that Nephi 
remembered that this thing had not 
been written.

13 And it came to pass that Jesus 
commanded that it should be a writ-
ten; therefore it was written accord-
ing as he commanded.

14 And now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had a expounded all the 
scriptures in one, which they had 
written, he commanded them that 
they should b teach the things which 
he had expounded unto them.

CHAPTER 24
The Lord’s messenger will prepare the 
way for the Second Coming—Christ will 
sit in judgment—Israel is commanded 
to pay tithes and offerings—A book of 
remembrance is kept—Compare Mala-
chi 3. About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that he com-
manded  them  that  they  should 
write the words which the Father 
had given unto Malachi, which he 
should tell unto them. And it came 
to pass that after they were written 
he expounded them. And these are 
the  words  which  he  did  tell  unto 
them, saying: Thus said the Father 
unto Malachi—Behold, I will a send 
my b messenger, and he shall prepare 
the  way  before  me,  and  the  Lord 
whom ye seek shall suddenly c come 
to his temple, even the d messenger 
of the covenant, whom ye delight 
in; behold, he shall come, saith the 
Lord of Hosts.

2 But who may a abide the day of 
his  coming,  and  who  shall  stand 
when he appeareth? For he is like

3 And he shall sit as a refiner and 
purifier of silver; and he shall a pu-
rify  the  b sons  of  Levi,  and  purge 
them as gold and silver, that they 
may c offer unto the Lord an offer-
ing in righteousness.

4 Then shall the offering of Judah 
and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
Lord, as in the days of old, and as 
in former years.

5 And  I  will  come  a near  to  you 
to judgment; and I will be a swift 
witness against the b sorcerers, and 
against the adulterers, and against 
false  c swearers,  and  against  those 
that  d oppress  the  hireling  in  his 
wages, the widow and the e father-
less, and that turn aside the f stranger, 
and  fear  not  me,  saith  the  Lord  
of Hosts.

6 For a I am the Lord, I change not; 
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not 
consumed.

7 Even  from  the  days  of  your 
fathers ye are gone away from mine 
a ordinances,  and  have  not  kept 
them. b Return unto me and I will 
return unto you, saith the Lord of 
Hosts.  But  ye  say:  Wherein  shall  
we return?

8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have 
robbed  me.  But  ye  say:  Wherein 
have  we  robbed  thee?  In  a tithes 
and b offerings.

9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for 
ye have robbed me, even this whole 
nation.

10 Bring  ye  all  the  a tithes  into 

the storehouse, that there may be 
b meat in my house; and prove me 
now  herewith,  saith  the  Lord  of 
Hosts,  if  I  will  not  open  you  the 
c windows of heaven, and pour you 
out a d blessing that there shall not 
be room enough to receive it.

11 And I will rebuke the a devourer 
for  your  sakes,  and  he  shall  not  
destroy the fruits of your ground; 
neither  shall  your  vine  cast  her 
fruit before the time in the fields, 
saith the Lord of Hosts.

12 And all nations shall call you  
blessed,  for  ye  shall  be  a  de-
lightsome  land,  saith  the  Lord  of  
Hosts.

13 Your  words  have  been  stout 
against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye 
say: What have we spoken against 
thee?

14 Ye have a said: It is b vain to serve 
God, and what doth it profit that 
we have kept his  c ordinances and 
that  we  have  walked  mournfully 
before the Lord of Hosts?

15 And  now  we  call  the  proud 
happy; yea, they that work wicked-
ness are set up; yea, they that tempt 
God are even delivered.

16 Then they that feared the Lord 
a spake  often  one  to  another,  and 
the  Lord  hearkened  and  heard; 
and a book of  b remembrance was

feared the Lord, and that thought 
upon his name.

CHAPTER 25
At the Second Coming, the proud and 
wicked will be burned as stubble—Eli-
jah  will  return  before  that  great  and 
dreadful  day—Compare  Malachi  4. 
About a.d. 34.
a For behold, the day cometh that 
shall b burn as an oven; and all the 
c proud, yea, and all that do wick-
edly, shall be stubble; and the day 
that  cometh  shall  burn  them  up, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall 
leave them neither root nor branch.
2 But unto you that fear my name, 
shall  the  a Son  of  Righteousness 
arise with healing in his wings; and 
ye shall go forth and  b grow up as 
c calves in the stall.

3 And  ye  shall  a tread  down  the 
wicked; for they shall be ashes un-
der the soles of your feet in the day 
that I shall do this, saith the Lord 
of Hosts.

4 Remember ye the law of Moses, 
my  servant,  which  I  commanded 
unto him in  a Horeb for all Israel, 
with the statutes and judgments.

5 Behold, I will send you a Elijah 
the  prophet  before  the  coming 
of the great and dreadful  b day of  
the Lord;

6 And he shall a turn the heart of 
the  b fathers  to  the  children,  and 
the  heart  of  the  children  to  their 
fathers, lest I come and c smite the 
earth with a curse.

CHAPTER 26
Jesus expounds all things from the be-
ginning to the end—Babes and children 
utter marvelous things that cannot be 
written—Those in the Church of Christ 
have all things in common among them. 
About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that when 
Jesus had told these things he ex-
pounded them unto the multitude; 
and he did expound all things unto 
them, both great and small.

2 And he saith: a These scriptures, 
which  ye  had  not  with  you,  the 
Father  commanded  that  I  should 
give  unto  you;  for  it  was  wisdom 
in him that they should be given 
unto future generations.

3 And he did expound all things, 
even from the beginning until the

of their works, whether they be good 
or whether they be evil—

5 If  they  be  good,  to  the  a resur-
rection  of  everlasting  life;  and  if 
they be evil, to the resurrection of 
damnation; being on a parallel, the 
one on the one hand and the other 
on the other hand, according to the 
mercy, and the b justice, and the ho-
liness which is in Christ, who was 
c before the world began.

6 And now there cannot be writ-
ten in this book even a a hundredth 
part of the things which Jesus did 
truly teach unto the people;

7 But behold the a plates of Nephi 
do  contain  the  more  part  of  the 
things which he taught the people.
8 And  these  things  have  I  writ-
ten, which are a a lesser part of the 
things which he taught the people; 
and I have written them to the in-
tent that they may be brought again 
unto this people, b from the Gentiles, 
according to the words which Jesus 
hath spoken.

9 And  when  they  shall  have  re-
ceived this, which is expedient that 
they should have first, to try their 
faith, and if it shall so be that they 
shall believe these things then shall 
the a greater things be made mani-
fest unto them.

10 And if it so be that they will not 
believe these things, then shall the 
a greater things be b withheld from 
them, unto their condemnation.

11 Behold,  I  was  about  to  write 
them,  all  which  were  engraven 
upon the plates of Nephi, but the 
Lord a forbade it, saying: I will b try 
the faith of my people.

12 Therefore  I,  a Mormon,  do 
write the things which have been  
commanded me of the Lord. And 
now  I,  b Mormon,  make  an  end  of 
my sayings, and proceed to write 
the things which have been com-
manded me.

13 Therefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should behold that the Lord truly 
did teach the people, for the space 
of three days; and after that he did 
a show himself unto them oft, and 
did break  b bread oft, and bless it, 
and give it unto them.

14 And it came to pass that he did 
teach and minister unto the a chil-
dren  of  the  multitude  of  whom 
hath been spoken, and he did b loose 
their c tongues, and they did speak 
unto their fathers great and mar-
velous things, even greater than he 
had revealed unto the people; and 
he  loosed  their  tongues  that  they  
could utter.

15 And it came to pass that after 
he had ascended into heaven—the 
second time that he showed him-
self unto them, and had gone unto 
the  Father,  after  having  a healed 
all their sick, and their lame, and  
opened  the  eyes  of  their  blind  
and unstopped the ears of the deaf, 
and even had done all manner of 
cures  among  them,  and  raised  a 
man from the b dead, and had shown 
forth his power unto them, and had 
ascended unto the Father—

16 Behold, it came to pass on the 
morrow that the multitude gathered 
themselves together, and they both 
saw and heard these children; yea, 
even a babes did open their mouths

and utter marvelous things; and the 
things  which  they  did  utter  were 
b forbidden  that  there  should  not 
any man write them.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a disciples whom Jesus had chosen 
began b from that time forth to c bap-
tize  and  to  teach  as  many  as  did 
come  unto  them;  and  as  many  as 
were baptized in the name of Jesus 
were filled with the Holy Ghost.

18 And  many  of  them  saw  and 
heard  unspeakable  things,  which 
are a not lawful to be written.

19 And they taught, and did a min-
ister one to another; and they had 
b all things c common among them, 
every man dealing justly, one with 
another.

20 And it came to pass that they 
did do all things even as Jesus had 
commanded them.

21 And  they  who  were  baptized 
in  the  name  of  Jesus  were  called 
the a church of Christ.

CHAPTER 27

Jesus commands them to call the Church 
in His name—His mission and atoning 
sacrifice constitute His gospel—Men are 
commanded to repent and be baptized 
that they may be sanctified by the Holy 
Ghost—They are to be even as Jesus is. 
About a.d. 34–35.
And it came to pass that as the dis-
ciples of Jesus were journeying and 
were  preaching  the  things  which 
they had both heard and seen, and 
were baptizing in the name of Jesus, 
it came to pass that the disciples were 
gathered together and were a united 
in b mighty prayer and c fasting.

2 And Jesus again a showed himself 
unto them, for they were praying 

unto the Father in his name; and 
Jesus came and stood in the midst 
of them, and said unto them: What 
will ye that I shall give unto you?

3 And they said unto him: Lord, 
we will that thou wouldst tell us the  
a name  whereby  we  shall  call  this 
church; for there are disputations 
among the people concerning this 
matter.

4 And  the  Lord  said  unto  them: 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, why 
is it that the people should murmur 
and dispute because of this thing?
5 Have they not read the scriptures, 
which say ye must take upon you 
the  a name  of  Christ,  which  is  my 
name? For by this name shall ye be 
called at the last day;

6 And whoso taketh upon him my 
name, and a endureth to the end, the 
same shall be saved at the last day.
7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall 
do, ye shall do it in my name; there-
fore ye shall call the church in my 
name;  and  ye  shall  call  upon  the 
Father in my name that he will bless  
the church for my sake.

8 And how be it a my b church save 
it be called in my name? For if a 
church be called in Moses’ name then 
it be Moses’ church; or if it be called 
in the name of a man then it be the  
church of a man; but if it be called 
in my name then it is my church, 
if it so be that they are built upon 
my gospel.

9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are 
built upon my gospel; therefore ye 
shall call whatsoever things ye do 
call, in my name; therefore if ye call 
upon the Father, for the church, if 
it be in my name the Father will 
hear you;

10 And if it so be that the church

is built upon my gospel then will 
the Father show forth his own works  
in it.

11 But if it be not built upon my 
gospel, and is built upon the works 
of men, or upon the works of the 
devil, verily I say unto you they have  
joy  in  their  works  for  a  season,  
and by and by the end cometh, and 
they are a hewn down and cast into 
the b fire, from whence there is no  
return.

12 For their works do a follow them, 
for it is because of their works that 
they are hewn down; therefore re-
member the things that I have told  
you.

13 Behold I have given unto you 
my  a gospel, and this is the gospel 
which I have given unto you—that I 
came into the world to do the b will 
of  my  Father,  because  my  Father  
sent me.

14 And my Father sent me that I 
might be a lifted up upon the b cross; 
and after that I had been lifted up 
upon the c cross, that I might d draw 
all men unto me, that as I have been 
lifted  up  by  men  even  so  should 
men be lifted up by the Father, to 
stand before me, to be  e judged of 
their works, whether they be good 
or whether they be evil—

15 And for this cause have I been 
a lifted up; therefore, according to 
the power of the Father I will draw 
all men unto me, that they may be 
judged according to their b works.

16 And it shall come to pass, that 

whoso  a repenteth and is baptized 
in my b name shall be filled; and if 
he  c endureth  to  the  end,  behold, 
him  will  I  hold  guiltless  before 
my Father at that day when I shall 
stand to judge the world.

17 And he that endureth not unto 
the end, the same is he that is also 
hewn down and cast into the fire, 
from  whence  they  can  no  more 
return,  because  of  the  a justice  of 
the Father.

18 And this is the word which he 
hath given unto the children of men. 
And for this cause he fulfilleth the 
words which he hath given, and he 
lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.
19 And  a no  unclean  thing  can 
enter into his kingdom; therefore 
nothing entereth into his b rest save 
it be those who have c washed their 
garments in my blood, because of 
their faith, and the repentance of 
all their sins, and their faithfulness 
unto the end.

20 Now this is the commandment: 
a Repent,  all  ye  ends  of  the  earth, 
and come unto me and be b baptized 
in my name, that ye may be c sanc-
tified by the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, that ye may stand d spotless 
before me at the last day.

21 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
this  is  my  a gospel;  and  ye  know 
the things that ye must b do in my 
church;  for  the  works  which  ye 
have seen me do that shall ye also 
do; for that which ye have seen me 
do even that shall ye do;

22 Therefore, if ye do these things 
blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted 
up at the last day.

23 a Write the things which ye have 
seen  and  heard,  save  it  be  those 
which are b forbidden.

24 Write the works of this people, 
which shall be, even as hath been 
written, of that which hath been.

25 For  behold,  out  of  the  books 
which have been written, and which 
shall be written, shall this people 
be a judged, for by them shall their 
b works be known unto men.

26 And behold, all things are a writ-
ten by the Father; therefore out of 
the  books  which  shall  be  written 
shall the world be judged.

27 And know ye that a ye shall be 
b judges  of  this  people,  according 
to the judgment which I shall give 
unto you, which shall be just. There-
fore, what c manner of men ought ye 
to be? Verily I say unto you, even  
d as I am.

28 And now I a go unto the Father. 
And verily I say unto you, whatso-
ever things ye shall ask the Father 
in my name shall be given unto you.
29 Therefore, a ask, and ye shall re-
ceive; knock, and it shall be opened 
unto you; for he that asketh, receiv-
eth; and unto him that knocketh, 
it shall be opened.

30 And  now,  behold,  my  joy  is 
great, even unto fulness, because of 
you, and also this generation; yea, 
and even the Father rejoiceth, and 
also all the holy angels, because of 
you and this generation; for a none 
of them are lost.

31 Behold, I would that ye should 

understand; for I mean them who 
are a now alive of b this generation; 
and none of them are lost; and in 
them I have fulness of c joy.

32 But  behold,  it  a sorroweth  me 
because of the  b fourth generation 
from this generation, for they are 
led  away  captive  by  him  even  as 
was the c son of perdition; for they 
will sell me for silver and for gold, 
and for that which d moth doth cor-
rupt and which thieves can break 
through and steal. And in that day 
will  I  visit  them,  even  in  turning 
their works upon their own heads.
33 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  ended  these  sayings  he 
said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at 
the a strait gate; for strait is the gate, 
and  narrow  is  the  way  that  leads 
to life, and few there be that find 
it; but wide is the gate, and broad 
the way which leads to death, and 
many there be that travel therein, 
until the night cometh, wherein no 
man can work.

CHAPTER 28
Nine of the twelve disciples desire and 
are promised an inheritance in Christ’s 
kingdom  when  they  die—The  Three 
Nephites desire and are given power over 
death so as to remain on the earth until 
Jesus comes again—They are translated 
and see things not lawful to utter, and 
they are now ministering among men.

me,  after  that  I  am  gone  to  the 
Father?

2 And they all spake, save it were 
three, saying: We desire that after 
we have lived unto the age of man, 
that  our  ministry,  wherein  thou 
hast  called  us,  may  have  an  end, 
that  we  may  speedily  come  unto 
thee in thy kingdom.

3 And he said unto them: Blessed 
are ye because ye desired this thing 
of me; therefore, after that ye are 
a seventy and two years old ye shall 
come unto me in my b kingdom; and 
with me ye shall find c rest.

4 And when he had spoken unto 
them, he turned himself unto the 
three,  and  said  unto  them:  What 
will ye that I should do unto you, 
when I am gone unto the Father?

5 And  they  sorrowed  in  their 
hearts, for they durst not speak unto 
him the thing which they desired.
6 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I a know your thoughts, and ye have 
desired the thing which b John, my 
beloved, who was with me in my 
ministry, before that I was lifted up 
by the Jews, desired of me.

7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, 
for ye shall a never taste of b death; 
but ye shall live to behold all the do-
ings of the Father unto the children  
of men, even until all things shall 
be fulfilled according to the will of 
the Father, when I shall come in my 
glory with the c powers of heaven.

8 And ye shall never endure the 
pains  of  death;  but  when  I  shall 
come  in  my  glory  ye  shall  be 
changed in the twinkling of an eye 
from  a mortality  to  b immortality; 

and then shall ye be blessed in the 
kingdom of my Father.

9 And again, ye shall not have pain 
while  ye  shall  dwell  in  the  flesh, 
neither  sorrow  save  it  be  for  the 
a sins of the world; and all this will 
I do because of the thing which ye 
have desired of me, for ye have de-
sired that ye might b bring the souls 
of men unto me, while the world 
shall stand.

10 And for this cause ye shall have 
a fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down 
in the kingdom of my Father; yea, 
your joy shall be full, even as the 
Father  hath  given  me  fulness  of 
joy; and ye shall be even as I am, 
and I am even as the Father; and 
the Father and I are b one;

11 And  the  a Holy  Ghost  beareth 
record of the Father and me; and 
the  Father  giveth  the  Holy  Ghost 
unto the children of men, because  
of me.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  spoken  these  words,  he 
touched every one of them with his 
finger save it were the a three who 
were to tarry, and then he departed.
13 And behold, the heavens were 
opened, and they were a caught up 
into  heaven,  and  saw  and  heard 
unspeakable things.

14 And  it  was  a forbidden  them 
that they should utter; neither was 
it given unto them b power that they 
could utter the things which they 
saw and heard;

15 And whether they were in the 
body or out of the body, they could 
not tell; for it did seem unto them 
like a a transfiguration of them, that

they were changed from this body 
of  flesh  into  an  immortal  state, 
that they could behold the things  
of God.

16 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did  again  minister  upon  the  face 
of the earth; nevertheless they did 
not  minister  of  the  things  which 
they had heard and seen, because 
of  the  commandment  which  was 
given them in heaven.

17 And  now,  whether  they  were 
mortal or immortal, from the day 
of their transfiguration, I know not;
18 But this much I know, accord-
ing to the record which hath been 
given—they did go forth upon the 
face of the land, and did minister 
unto all the people, uniting as many 
to the church as would believe in 
their  preaching;  baptizing  them, 
and as many as were baptized did 
receive the Holy Ghost.

19 And they were cast into prison 
by them who did not belong to the 
church. And the a prisons could not 
hold  them,  for  they  were  rent  in 
twain.

20 And they were cast down into 
the  earth;  but  they  did  smite  the 
earth with the word of God, inso-
much that by his a power they were 
delivered out of the depths of the 
earth; and therefore they could not 
dig pits sufficient to hold them.

21 And thrice they were cast into 

a a furnace and received no harm.

22 And twice were they cast into 
a  a den of wild beasts; and behold 
they did play with the beasts as a 
child with a suckling lamb, and re-
ceived no harm.

23 And it came to pass that thus 
they  did  go  forth  among  all  the 
people  of  Nephi,  and  did  preach 
the a gospel of Christ unto all peo-
ple upon the face of the land; and 

they were converted unto the Lord, 
and were united unto the church of 
Christ, and thus the people of b that 
generation were blessed, according 
to the word of Jesus.

24 And now I, a Mormon, make an 
end of speaking concerning these 
things for a time.

25 Behold, I was about to write the 
a names of those who were never to 
taste of death, but the Lord forbade; 
therefore I write them not, for they 
are hid from the world.

26 But behold, a I have seen them, 
and they have ministered unto me.
27 And behold they will be a among 
the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall 
know them not.

28 They  will  also  be  among  the 
Jews,  and  the  Jews  shall  know 
them not.

29 And it shall come to pass, when 
the  Lord  seeth  fit  in  his  wisdom 
that they shall minister unto all the 
a scattered tribes of Israel, and unto 
all nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people, and shall bring out of them 
unto  Jesus  many  souls,  that  their 
desire  may  be  fulfilled,  and  also 
because  of  the  convincing  power 
of God which is in them.

30 And they are as the a angels of 
God, and if they shall pray unto the 
Father in the name of Jesus they can 
show themselves unto whatsoever 
man it seemeth them good.

31 Therefore, great and marvelous 
works  shall  be  wrought  by  them, 
before the  a great and coming day 
when all people must surely stand 
before the judgment-seat of Christ;
32 Yea  even  among  the  Gentiles 
shall there be a a great and marvel-
ous work wrought by them, before 
that judgment day.

marvelous  works  of  Christ,  ye 
would,  according  to  the  words  of 
Christ, know that these things must 
surely come.

34 And wo be unto him that will 
a not hearken unto the words of Jesus, 
and  also  to  them  whom  he  hath 
chosen and b sent among them; for 
whoso c receiveth not the words of 
Jesus and the words of those whom 
he hath sent receiveth not him; and 
therefore he will not receive them 
at the last day;

35 And it would be better for them 
if they had not been born. For do ye  
suppose that ye can get rid of the  
justice of an a offended God, who hath  
been b trampled under feet of men, 
that thereby salvation might come?
36 And  now  behold,  as  I  spake 
concerning  those  whom  the  Lord 
hath chosen, yea, even three who 
were  caught  up  into  the  heavens, 
that I knew not whether they were 
a cleansed  from  b mortality  to  im-
mortality—

37 But behold, since I wrote, I have 
inquired of the Lord, and he hath 
made it manifest unto me that there 
must  needs  be  a  change  wrought 
upon their bodies, or else it needs 
be that they must taste of death;

38 Therefore, that they might not 
taste of death there was a a change 
wrought  upon  their  bodies,  that 
they  might  not  b suffer  pain  nor 
sorrow save it were for the sins of 
the world.

39 Now this change was not equal 
to that which shall take place at the 
last  day;  but  there  was  a  change 
wrought  upon  them,  insomuch 
that  Satan  could  have  no  power 
over them, that he could not a tempt 
them; and they were b sanctified in 
the flesh, that they were c holy, and 

that the powers of the earth could 
not hold them.

40 And in this state they were to 
remain until the judgment day of 
Christ; and at that day they were 
to receive a greater change, and to 
be  received  into  the  kingdom  of 
the Father to go no more out, but 
to dwell with God eternally in the 
heavens.

CHAPTER 29

The coming forth of the Book of Mor-
mon is a sign that the Lord has com-
menced  to  gather  Israel  and  fulfill 
His covenants—Those who reject His 
latter-day revelations and gifts will be 
cursed. About a.d. 34–35.

And  now  behold,  I  say  unto  you 
that when the Lord shall see fit, in 
his wisdom, that these sayings shall 
a come unto the Gentiles according 
to his word, then ye may know that 
the  b covenant  which  the  Father 
hath made with the children of Is-
rael,  concerning  their  restoration 
to the  c lands of their inheritance, 
is already beginning to be fulfilled.
2 And ye may know that the words 
of the Lord, which have been spo-
ken by the holy prophets, shall all 
be  fulfilled;  and  ye  need  not  say 
that  the  Lord  a delays  his  coming 
unto the children of Israel.

3 And  ye  need  not  imagine  in 
your hearts that the words which 
have been spoken are vain, for be-
hold, the Lord will remember his 
covenant which he hath made unto 
his people of the house of Israel.

4 And when ye shall see these say-
ings coming forth among you, then 
ye need not any longer spurn at the 
doings of the Lord, for the a sword 
of his b justice is in his right hand;

and behold, at that day, if ye shall 
spurn at his doings he will cause 
that it shall soon overtake you.

5 a Wo unto him that b spurneth at 
the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto 
him that shall c deny the Christ and 
his works!

6 Yea, a wo unto him that shall deny 
the revelations of the Lord, and that 
shall say the Lord no longer worketh 
by revelation, or by prophecy, or by 
b gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, 
or by the power of the Holy Ghost!
7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall 
say at that day, to get a gain, that there  
can be b no miracle wrought by Jesus 
Christ; for he that doeth this shall 
become c like unto the son of perdi-
tion, for whom there was no mercy, 
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer 
a hiss, nor b spurn, nor make game of 
the c Jews, nor any of the remnant 
of the house of Israel; for behold, 
the Lord remembereth his covenant 
unto  them,  and  he  will  do  unto 
them  according  to  that  which  he 
hath sworn.

9 Therefore ye need not suppose 
that ye can turn the right hand of 
the Lord unto the left, that he may 
not execute judgment unto the ful-

filling  of  the  covenant  which  he 
hath made unto the house of Israel.

CHAPTER 30

The latter-day Gentiles are commanded 
to repent, come unto Christ, and be num-
bered with the house of Israel. About 
a.d. 34–35.
Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear 
the words of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of  the  living  God,  which  he  hath 
a commanded me that I should speak 
concerning you, for, behold he com-
mandeth  me  that  I  should  write,  
saying:

2 Turn, all ye a Gentiles, from your 
wicked ways; and  b repent of your 
evil doings, of your c lyings and de-
ceivings, and of your whoredoms, 
and  of  your  secret  abominations, 
and  your  idolatries,  and  of  your 
d murders,  and  your  e priestcrafts, 
and your f envyings, and your strifes, 
and from all your wickedness and 
abominations, and come unto me, 
and be baptized in my name, that ye 
may receive a remission of your sins, 
and be filled with the Holy Ghost, 
that  ye  may  be  g numbered  with 
my people who are of the house of  
Israel.

WhO iS The SOn Of nePhi—One Of The  
diSCiPLeS Of JeSUS ChriST

An account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.

The  Nephites  and  the  Lamanites  are 
all converted unto the Lord—They have 
all things in common, work miracles, 
and prosper in the land—After two cen-
turies, divisions, evils, false churches, 
and  persecutions  arise—After  three 
hundred years, both the Nephites and 
the  Lamanites  are  wicked—Amma-
ron hides up the sacred records. About  
a.d. 35–321.

AND  it  came  to  pass  that  the  

   thirty and fourth year passed  
   away, and also the thirty and 
fifth,  and  behold  the  disciples  of 
Jesus had formed a church of Christ 
in all the lands round about. And as 
many as did come unto them, and 
did truly repent of their sins, were 
a baptized in the name of Jesus; and 
they did also receive the Holy Ghost.
2 And it came to pass in the thirty 
and sixth year, the people were all  
converted unto the Lord, upon all 
the face of the land, both Nephites 
and Lamanites, and there were no 
contentions and disputations among 
them, and every man did deal justly 
one with another.

3 And  they  had  a all  things  com-
mon among them; therefore there 
were not rich and poor, bond and 
free, but they were all made free, 
and partakers of the heavenly b gift.
4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
thirty and seventh year passed away 
also, and there still continued to be 
a peace in the land.

5 And there were great and mar-
velous  works  wrought  by  the  dis-
ciples  of  Jesus,  insomuch  that 
they did  a heal the sick, and  b raise 
the  dead,  and  cause  the  lame  to 
walk,  and  the  blind  to  receive 
their  sight,  and  the  deaf  to  hear; 
and  all  manner  of  c miracles  did 
they  work  among  the  children  of 
men; and in nothing did they work 
miracles save it were in the name  
of Jesus.

6 And  thus  did  the  thirty  and 
eighth year pass away, and also the 
thirty and ninth, and forty and first, 
and the forty and second, yea, even 
until forty and nine years had passed 
away, and also the fifty and first, 
and the fifty and second; yea, and 
even until fifty and nine years had  
passed away.

7 And the Lord did prosper them 
exceedingly  in  the  land;  yea,  in-
somuch  that  they  did  build  cities 
again where there had been cities  
burned.

8 Yea,  even  that  great  a city  Zara-
hemla  did  they  cause  to  be  built  
again.

9 But there were many cities which 
had been  a sunk, and waters came 
up  in  the  stead  thereof;  therefore 
these cities could not be renewed.
10 And now, behold, it came to pass 
that the people of Nephi did wax 
strong, and did multiply exceedingly  
fast, and became an exceedingly a fair  
and delightsome people.

11 And  they  were  married,  and 
given in marriage, and were blessed 
according to the multitude of the 
a promises which the Lord had made 
unto them.

12 And they did not walk any more 
after the a performances and b ordi-
nances of the c law of Moses; but they 
did walk after the commandments 
which they had received from their 
Lord and their God, continuing in 
d fasting  and  prayer,  and  in  meet-
ing together oft both to pray and 
to hear the word of the Lord.

13 And it came to pass that there 
was  no  contention  among  all  the  
people,  in  all  the  land;  but  there 
were  mighty  miracles  wrought 
among the disciples of Jesus.

14 And it came to pass that the sev-
enty and first year passed away, and 
also the seventy and second year, 
yea, and in fine, till the seventy and 
ninth  year  had  passed  away;  yea, 
even an hundred years had passed 
away,  and  the  a disciples  of  Jesus, 
whom he had chosen, had all gone to 
the b paradise of God, save it were the  
c three who should tarry; and there 
were other d disciples e ordained in 
their stead; and also many of that 
f generation had passed away.

15 And it came to pass that there 
was no a contention in the land, be-
cause of the b love of God which did 
dwell in the hearts of the people.

16 And there were no  a envyings, 
nor b strifes, nor c tumults, nor whore-
doms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor 
any manner of d lasciviousness; and 
surely  there  could  not  be  a  e hap-
pier people among all the people 
who had been created by the hand  
of God.

17 There  were  no  robbers,  nor 
murderers, neither were there La-
manites, nor any manner of -ites; 
but they were in a one, the children 
of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom 
of God.

18 And how blessed were they! For 
the Lord did bless them in all their 
doings; yea, even they were blessed 
and  prospered  until  an  hundred 
and ten years had passed away; and 
the  first  generation  from  Christ 
had passed away, and there was no  
contention in all the land.

19 And it came to pass that a Nephi, 
he that kept this last record, (and he 
kept it upon the b plates of Nephi) 
died, and his son Amos kept it in 
his stead; and he kept it upon the 
plates of Nephi also.

20 And he kept it eighty and four 
years, and there was still peace in 
the land, save it were a small part  
of the people who had revolted from 
the  church  and  taken  upon  them 
the name of Lamanites; therefore 
there began to be a Lamanites again 
in the land.

21 And it came to pass that a Amos 
died also, (and it was an hundred 
and ninety and four years from the 
coming of Christ) and his son Amos 
kept  the  record  in  his  stead;  and 
he also kept it upon the plates of 
Nephi; and it was also written in the 
book of Nephi, which is this book.
22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred  years  had  passed  away; 
and the second generation had all 
passed away save it were a few.

23 And now I, Mormon, would that 
ye should know that the people had 
multiplied, insomuch that they were 
spread upon all the face of the land,

and that they had become exceed-
ingly  a rich, because of their pros-
perity in Christ.

24 And now, in this two hundred 
and  first  year  there  began  to  be 
among them those who were lifted 
up in a pride, such as the wearing of 
costly apparel, and all manner of 
fine pearls, and of the fine things 
of the world.

25 And from that time forth they 
did have their goods and their sub-
stance  no  more  a common  among 
them.

26 And they began to be divided 
into classes; and they began to build 
up a churches unto themselves to get 
b gain, and began to deny the true 
church of Christ.

27 And it came to pass that when 
two  hundred  and  ten  years  had 
passed  away  there  were  many 
churches in the land; yea, there were 
many churches which professed to 
know the Christ, and yet they did 
a deny the more parts of his gospel, 
insomuch that they did receive all 
manner of wickedness, and did ad-
minister that which was sacred unto 
him to whom it had been b forbidden  
because of unworthiness.

28 And this church did multiply 
exceedingly  because  of  iniquity, 
and because of the power of a Satan 
who did get hold upon their b hearts.
29 And again, there was another 
church  which  denied  the  Christ; 
and  they  did  a persecute  the  true 
b church of Christ, because of their 
humility and their belief in Christ; 
and they did despise them because 
of the many miracles which were 
wrought among them.

30 Therefore  they  did  exercise  
power and authority over the dis-
ciples of Jesus who did tarry with 

them, and they did cast them into 
a prison;  but  by  the  power  of  the 
word of God, which was in them, 
the prisons were rent in twain, and 
they went forth doing mighty mir-
acles among them.

31 Nevertheless, and notwithstand-
ing all these miracles, the people 
did  harden  their  hearts,  and  did 
seek to kill them, even as the Jews 
at  Jerusalem  sought  to  kill  Jesus, 
according to his word.

32 And  they  did  cast  them  into 
a furnaces  of  b fire,  and  they  came 
forth receiving no harm.

33 And  they  also  cast  them  into 
a dens of wild beasts, and they did 
play with the wild beasts even as a 
child with a lamb; and they did come 
forth from among them, receiving  
no harm.

34 Nevertheless,  the  people  did 
harden their hearts, for they were 
led  by  many  priests  and  a false 
prophets to build up many churches, 
and to do all manner of iniquity. 
And they did b smite upon the peo-
ple of Jesus; but the people of Jesus 
did not smite again. And thus they 
did dwindle in unbelief and wick-
edness, from year to year, even until 
two hundred and thirty years had  
passed away.

35 And now it came to pass in this 
year, yea, in the two hundred and 
thirty  and  first  year,  there  was  a 
great division among the people.

36 And it came to pass that in this 
year there arose a people who were 
called the a Nephites, and they were 
true believers in Christ; and among 
them  there  were  those  who  were 
called by the Lamanites—Jacobites, 
and Josephites, and b Zoramites;

37 Therefore the true believers in  
Christ, and the true worshipers of

Christ, (among whom were the a three 
disciples of Jesus who should tarry)  
were called Nephites, and Jacobites, 
and Josephites, and Zoramites.

38 And it came to pass that they 
who rejected the gospel were called 
Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ish-
maelites; and they did not dwindle 
in a unbelief, but they did b wilfully 
rebel against the gospel of Christ; 
and they did teach their children 
that they should not believe, even 
as their fathers, from the beginning, 
did dwindle.

39 And  it  was  because  of  the 
wickedness  and  abomination  of 
their fathers, even as it was in the 
beginning. And they were a taught 
to hate the children of God, even 
as  the  Lamanites  were  taught  to 
b hate  the  children  of  Nephi  from 
the beginning.

40 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and forty and four years 
had passed away, and thus were the 
affairs of the people. And the a more 
wicked part of the people did wax 
strong,  and  became  exceedingly 
more numerous than were the peo-
ple of God.

41 And they did still continue to 
build up churches unto themselves, 
and  adorn  them  with  all  manner 
of  precious  things.  And  thus  did 
two  hundred  and  fifty  years  pass 
away,  and  also  two  hundred  and 
sixty years.

42 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
wicked  part  of  the  people  began 
again to build up the secret oaths 
and a combinations of Gadianton.

43 And also the people who were 
called the people of Nephi began to 
be proud in their hearts, because of 

their exceeding riches, and become 
a vain like unto their brethren, the 
Lamanites.

44 And from this time the disci-
ples began to sorrow for the  a sins 
of the world.

45 And it came to pass that when 
three  hundred  years  had  passed 
away,  both  the  people  of  Nephi 
and  the  Lamanites  had  become 
exceedingly wicked one like unto  
another.

46 And it came to pass that the rob-
bers of a Gadianton did spread over 
all the face of the land; and there 
were none that were righteous save 
it were the disciples of Jesus. And 
gold and silver did they lay up in 
store in abundance, and did b traffic 
in all manner of traffic.

47 And it came to pass that after 
three hundred and five years had 
passed away, (and the people did 
still remain in wickedness) a Amos 
died;  and  his  brother,  Ammaron, 
did keep the record in his stead.

48 And it came to pass that when 
three  hundred  and  twenty  years 
had passed away, a Ammaron, being 
constrained by the Holy Ghost, did 
b hide up the  c records which were 
d sacred—yea,  even  all  the  sacred 
records  which  had  been  handed 
down from generation to generation, 
which were sacred—even until the 
three hundred and twentieth year 
from the coming of Christ.

49 And he did hide them up unto 
the  Lord,  that  they  might  a come 
again unto the remnant of the house 
of Jacob, according to the prophe-
cies and the promises of the Lord. 
And thus is the end of the record 
of Ammaron.

The Book of MorMon

CHAPTER 1

Ammaron instructs Mormon concerning  
the sacred records—War commences be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites— 
The Three Nephites are taken away—
Wickedness,  unbelief,  sorceries,  and 
witchcraft prevail. About a.d. 321–26.

AND  now  I,  Mormon,  make  a  

  a record of the things which I  
   have both seen and heard, and 

call it the b Book of Mormon.

2 And  about  the  time  that  a Am-
maron hid up the records unto the 
Lord,  he  came  unto  me,  (I  being 
about ten years of age, and I began 
to be b learned somewhat after the 
manner of the learning of my peo-
ple) and Ammaron said unto me: I 
perceive that thou art a c sober child, 
and art quick to observe;

3 Therefore,  when  ye  are  about 
twenty and four years old I would 
that ye should remember the things 
that ye have observed concerning 
this people; and when ye are of that 
age go to the a land Antum, unto a 
hill  which  shall  be  called  b Shim; 
and  there  have  I  deposited  unto 
the Lord all the sacred engravings 
concerning this people.

father into the land southward, even 
to the land of Zarahemla.

7 The whole face of the land had 
become covered with buildings, and 
the people were as numerous almost, 
as it were the sand of the sea.

8 And it came to pass in this year 
there  began  to  be  a  war  between 
the a Nephites, who consisted of the 
Nephites and the Jacobites and the 
Josephites and the Zoramites; and 
this war was between the Nephites, 
and the Lamanites and the Lemuel-
ites and the Ishmaelites.

9 Now  the  a Lamanites  and  the 
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were 
called Lamanites, and the two par-
ties were Nephites and Lamanites.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
war  began  to  be  among  them  in 
the  borders  of  Zarahemla,  by  the 
waters of Sidon.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  had  gathered  together  a 
great number of men, even to ex-
ceed the number of thirty thousand. 
And it came to pass that they did 
have  in  this  same  year  a  number 
of  a battles, in which the Nephites 
did beat the Lamanites and did slay 
many of them.

4 And  behold,  ye  shall  take  the 
a plates of Nephi unto yourself, and 
the remainder shall ye leave in the 
place where they are; and ye shall 
engrave on the plates of Nephi all 
the  things  that  ye  have  observed 
concerning this people.

5 And I, Mormon, being a descen-
dant  of  a Nephi,  (and  my  father’s 
name was Mormon) I remembered 
the  things  which  Ammaron  com-
manded me.

6 And it came to pass that I, being 
eleven years old, was carried by my 

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites withdrew their design, 
and there was peace settled in the 
land; and peace did remain for the 
space of about four years, that there 
was no bloodshed.

13 But  wickedness  did  prevail 
upon  the  face  of  the  whole  land, 
insomuch  that  the  Lord  did  take 
away  his  a beloved  disciples,  and 
the work of miracles and of healing 
did cease because of the iniquity of  
the people.

14 And there were no a gifts from

the Lord, and the b Holy Ghost did 
not come upon any, because of their 
wickedness and c unbelief.

15 And I, being  a fifteen years of 
age and being somewhat of a  b so-
ber mind, therefore I was  c visited 
of the Lord, and d tasted and knew 
of the goodness of Jesus.

16 And I did endeavor to preach 
unto  this  people,  but  my  mouth 
was shut, and I was forbidden that 
I should preach unto them; for be-
hold  they  had  a wilfully  rebelled 
against their God; and the beloved 
disciples were  b taken away out of 
the land, because of their iniquity.
17 But I did remain among them, 
but I was forbidden to a preach unto 
them,  because  of  the  hardness  of 
their  hearts;  and  because  of  the 
hardness  of  their  hearts  the  land 
was b cursed for their sake.

18 And these Gadianton robbers, 
who were among the Lamanites, did 
infest the land, insomuch that the 
inhabitants thereof began to a hide 
up their b treasures in the earth; and 
they became slippery, because the 
Lord had cursed the land, that they 
could  not  hold  them,  nor  retain 
them again.

19 And it came to pass that there 
were  a sorceries,  and  witchcrafts, 
and magics; and the power of the 
evil one was wrought upon all the 
face of the land, even unto the ful-
filling of all the words of Abinadi, 
and also b Samuel the Lamanite.

CHAPTER 2
Mormon  leads  the  Nephite  armies—
Blood and carnage sweep the land—The 
Nephites lament and mourn with the 
sorrowing  of  the  damned—Their  day 

of  grace  is  passed—Mormon  obtains 
the  plates  of  Nephi—Wars  continue. 
About a.d. 327–50.
And  it  came  to  pass  in  that  same 
year there began to be a war again 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites.  And  notwithstanding  I 
being  a young,  was  large  in  stat-
ure; therefore the people of Nephi 
appointed  me  that  I  should  be 
their leader, or the leader of their  
armies.

2 Therefore it came to pass that in 
my sixteenth year I did go forth at 
the head of an army of the Neph-
ites, against the Lamanites; there-
fore three hundred and twenty and 
six years had passed away.

3 And it came to pass that in the 
three  hundred  and  twenty  and 
seventh  year  the  Lamanites  did 
come  upon  us  with  a exceedingly 
great  power,  insomuch  that  they 
did frighten my armies; therefore 
they would not fight, and they be-
gan  to  retreat  towards  the  b north  
countries.

4 And it came to pass that we did 
come to the city of Angola, and we 
did take possession of the city, and 
make preparations to defend our-
selves against the Lamanites. And it 
came to pass that we did a fortify the 
city with our might; but notwith-
standing all our fortifications the 
Lamanites did come upon us and 
did drive us out of the city.

5 And they did also drive us forth 

out of the land of David.

6 And we marched forth and came 
to the land of Joshua, which was in 
the borders west by the seashore.

7 And it came to pass that we did 
gather in our people as fast as it were

possible,  that  we  might  get  them 
together in a one body.

8 But behold, the land was a filled 
with b robbers and with Lamanites; 
and notwithstanding the great de-
struction which hung over my peo-
ple, they did not repent of their evil 
doings; therefore there was blood 
and carnage spread throughout all 
the  face  of  the  land,  both  on  the  
part  of  the  Nephites  and  also  on  
the part of the Lamanites; and it was 
one complete revolution through-
out all the face of the land.

9 And now, the Lamanites had a 
king, and his name was a Aaron; and 
he came against us with an army of 
forty and four thousand. And be-
hold, I withstood him with forty and 
two thousand. And it came to pass 
that I beat him with my army that 
he fled before me. And behold, all 
this was done, and three hundred 
and thirty years had passed away.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began to repent of their 
iniquity, and began to cry even as 
had been prophesied by Samuel the 
prophet; for behold no man could 
a keep that which was his own, for 
the  thieves,  and  the  robbers,  and 
the murderers, and the magic art, 
and  the  witchcraft  which  was  in 
the land.

11 Thus there began to be a a mourn-
ing  and  a  lamentation  in  all  the 
land  because  of  these  things,  and 
more especially among the people 
of Nephi.

12 And it came to pass that when I, 
Mormon, saw their lamentation and 
their  a mourning and their sorrow 
before the Lord, my heart did begin 
to rejoice within me, knowing the 
mercies and the long-suffering of 

the Lord, therefore supposing that 
he  would  be  merciful  unto  them 
that  they  would  b again  become  a 
righteous people.

13 But behold this my joy was vain, 
for their  a sorrowing was not unto 
repentance, because of the goodness 
of God; but it was rather the b sor-
rowing of the c damned, because the 
Lord would not always suffer them 
to take d happiness in sin.

14 And  they  did  not  come  unto 
Jesus with broken a hearts and con-
trite spirits, but they did b curse God, 
and wish to die. Nevertheless they 
would struggle with the sword for 
their lives.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  my 
sorrow did return unto me again, 
and  I  saw  that  the  a day  of  b grace 
c was passed with them, both tem-
porally  and  spiritually;  for  I  saw 
thousands of them hewn down in 
open d rebellion against their God, 
and heaped up as e dung upon the 
face  of  the  land.  And  thus  three 
hundred and forty and four years 
had passed away.

16 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and forty and fifth 
year the Nephites did begin to flee 
before the Lamanites; and they were 
pursued until they came even to the 
land of Jashon, before it was pos-
sible to stop them in their retreat.
17 And  now,  the  city  of  Jashon 
was near the  a land where Amma-
ron had b deposited the records unto 
the  Lord,  that  they  might  not  be 
destroyed. And behold I had gone 
according to the word of Ammaron, 
and taken the c plates of Nephi, and 
did make a record according to the 
words of Ammaron.

18 And upon the plates of Nephi I

did make a full account of all the 
wickedness and abominations; but 
upon a these plates I did forbear to 
make a full account of their wicked-
ness and abominations, for behold, 
a continual scene of wickedness and 
abominations has been before mine 
eyes ever since I have been suffi-
cient to behold the ways of man.

19 And wo is me because of their 
wickedness; for my heart has been 
filled with sorrow because of their 
wickedness, all my days; neverthe-
less, I know that I shall be  a lifted 
up at the last day.

20 And it came to pass that in this 
year the people of Nephi again were 
hunted and driven. And it came to 
pass that we were driven forth un-
til we had come northward to the 
land which was called Shem.

21 And it came to pass that we did 
a fortify  the  city  of  Shem,  and  we 
did gather in our people as much 
as it were possible, that perhaps we 
might save them from destruction.
22 And it came to pass in the three 
hundred and forty and sixth year 
they began to come upon us again.
23 And it came to pass that I did 
speak unto my people, and did urge 
them with great energy, that they 
would stand boldly before the La-
manites and a fight for their b wives, 
and their children, and their houses, 
and their homes.

24 And my words did arouse them 
somewhat to vigor, insomuch that 
they did not flee from before the 
Lamanites, but did stand with bold-
ness against them.

25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
did contend with an army of thirty 
thousand against an army of fifty 
thousand. And it came to pass that 
we did stand before them with such 
firmness  that  they  did  flee  from 
before us.

26 And it came to pass that when 
they had fled we did pursue them 

with our armies, and did meet them 
again, and did  a beat them; never-
theless  the  b strength  of  the  Lord 
was not with us; yea, we were left 
to ourselves, that the Spirit of the 
Lord did not abide in us; therefore 
we had become weak like unto our 
brethren.

27 And  my  heart  did  sorrow  be-
cause of this the great calamity of 
my people, because of their wick-
edness and their abominations. But 
behold, we did go forth against the 
Lamanites and the robbers of Gadi-
anton,  until  we  had  again  taken 
possession of the lands of our in-
heritance.

28 And  the  three  hundred  and 
forty  and  ninth  year  had  passed 
away. And in the three hundred and 
fiftieth year we made a treaty with 
the Lamanites and the robbers of 
Gadianton, in which we did get the 
lands of our inheritance divided.

29 And  the  Lamanites  did  give 
unto us the land a northward, yea, 
even to the b narrow passage which 
led into the land southward. And 
we did give unto the Lamanites all 
the land southward.

Mormon  cries  repentance  unto  the 
Nephites—They gain a great victory and 
glory in their own strength—Mormon

And it came to pass that the Laman-
ites did not come to battle again un-
til ten years more had passed away. 
And  behold,  I  had  employed  my 
people, the Nephites, in preparing 
their lands and their arms against 
the time of battle.

this people—Repent ye, and come 
unto me, and be ye baptized, and 
build up again my church, and ye 
shall be a spared.

3 And I did cry unto this people, 
but  it  was  a in  vain;  and  they  did 
b not  realize  that  it  was  the  Lord 
that had spared them, and granted 
unto them a chance for repentance. 
And behold they did harden their 
hearts against the Lord their God.
4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
this  tenth  year  had  passed  away, 
making, in the whole, three hundred 
and sixty years from the coming of 
Christ,  the  king  of  the  Lamanites 
sent an epistle unto me, which gave 
unto  me  to  know  that  they  were 
preparing to come again to battle  
against us.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  did 
cause my people that they should 
gather themselves together at the 
land a Desolation, to a city which was 
in the borders, by the narrow pass 
which led into the land b southward.
6 And  there  we  did  place  our 
armies,  that  we  might  stop  the 
armies of the Lamanites, that they 
might not get possession of any of 
our lands; therefore we did fortify 
against them with all our force.

7 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and sixty and first 
year the Lamanites did come down 
to the a city of Desolation to battle 
against us; and it came to pass that 
in that year we did beat them, inso-
much that they did return to their 
own lands again.

8 And in the three hundred and 
sixty  and  second  year  they  did 
come  down  a again  to  battle.  And 
we  did  beat  them  again,  and  did 

slay a great number of them, and 
their dead were cast into the sea.

9 And now, because of this great 
thing which my people, the Neph-
ites, had done, they began to a boast 
in  their  own  strength,  and  began 
to  swear  before  the  heavens  that 
they  would  avenge  themselves  of 
the  blood  of  their  brethren  who 
had been slain by their enemies.

10 And  they  did  a swear  by  the 
heavens,  and  also  by  the  throne 
of God, that they b would go up to 
battle  against  their  enemies,  and 
would cut them off from the face of  
the land.

11 And it came to pass that I, Mor-
mon, did utterly a refuse from this 
time forth to be a commander and 
a leader of this people, because of 
their wickedness and abomination.
12 Behold, I had led them, notwith-
standing their wickedness I had led 
them many times to battle, and had 
loved them, according to the a love of 
God which was in me, with all my 
heart; and my soul had been poured 
out in prayer unto my God all the 
day long for them; nevertheless, it 
was b without faith, because of the 
c hardness of their hearts.

13 And  a thrice  have  I  delivered 
them out of the hands of their en-
emies, and they have repented not 
of their sins.

14 And when they had sworn by 
all that had been a forbidden them 
by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
that they would go up unto their 
enemies to battle, and avenge them-
selves of the blood of their breth-
ren,  behold  the  voice  of  the  Lord 
came unto me, saying:

b repay;  and  because  this  people 
repented not after I had delivered 
them, behold, they shall be cut off 
from the face of the earth.

16 And it came to pass that I ut-
terly refused to go up against mine 
enemies; and I did even as the Lord 
had commanded me; and I did stand 
as an idle witness to manifest unto 
the world the things which I saw 
and heard, according to the mani-
festations of the Spirit which had 
testified of things to come.

17 Therefore  I  write  a unto  you, 
Gentiles, and also unto you, house 
of Israel, when the work shall com-
mence, that ye shall be about to pre-
pare to return to the land of your  
inheritance;

18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the 
ends  of  the  earth;  yea,  unto  you, 
twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be  
a judged according to your works by 
the twelve whom Jesus chose to be  
his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.
19 And I write also unto the rem-
nant of this people, who shall also 
be  judged  by  the  a twelve  whom 
Jesus chose in this land; and they 
shall be judged by the other twelve 
whom  Jesus  chose  in  the  land  of  
Jerusalem.

20 And these things doth the Spirit 
manifest unto me; therefore I write 
unto you all. And for this cause I 
write unto you, that ye may know 
that  ye  must  all  stand  before  the 
a judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every 
soul who belongs to the whole hu-
man b family of Adam; and ye must 
stand to be judged of your works, 
whether they be good or evil;

21 And also that ye may a believe 
the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ,  which 
ye shall b have among you; and also 

that the c Jews, the covenant people 
of the Lord, shall have other d wit-
ness  besides  him  whom  they  saw 
and heard, that Jesus, whom they 
slew, was the e very Christ and the 
very God.

22 And I would that I could per-
suade  a all ye ends of the earth to 
repent and prepare to stand before 
the judgment-seat of Christ.

CHAPTER 4

War and carnage continue—The wicked 
punish  the  wicked—Greater  wicked-
ness  prevails  than  ever  before  in  all 
Israel—Women and children are sacri-
ficed to idols—The Lamanites begin to 
sweep the Nephites before them. About 
a.d. 363–75.
And now it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and sixty and third 
year the Nephites did go up with their  
armies  to  a battle  against  the  La-
manites, out of the land Desolation.
2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Nephites were driven 
back again to the land of Desolation. 
And while they were yet weary, a 
fresh  army  of  the  Lamanites  did 
come upon them; and they had a 
sore battle, insomuch that the La-
manites did take possession of the 
a city Desolation, and did slay many 
of the Nephites, and did take many 
prisoners.

3 And the remainder did flee and 
join the inhabitants of the city Te-
ancum. Now the city Teancum lay 
in the borders by the seashore; and 
it was also near the city a Desolation.
4 And it was a because the armies 
of the Nephites went up unto the 
Lamanites  that  they  began  to  be 
smitten; for were it not for that, the

Lamanites could have had no power 
over them.

5 But,  behold,  the  judgments  of 
God will overtake the a wicked; and 
it is by the wicked that the wicked 
are b punished; for it is the wicked 
that stir up the hearts of the chil-
dren of men unto bloodshed.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did make preparations 
to come against the city Teancum.
7 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  
three hundred and sixty and fourth 
year  the  Lamanites  did  come 
against the city Teancum, that they 
might take possession of the city  
Teancum also.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were repulsed and driven back by 
the Nephites. And when the Neph-
ites saw that they had driven the 
Lamanites  they  did  again  a boast 
of  their  own  strength;  and  they 
went forth in their own might, and 
took  possession  again  of  the  city  
Desolation.

9 And  now  all  these  things  had 
been  done,  and  there  had  been 
thousands slain on both sides, both 
the Nephites and the Lamanites.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
three hundred and sixty and sixth 
year had passed away, and the La-
manites came again upon the Neph-
ites to battle; and yet the Nephites 
repented not of the evil they had 
done, but persisted in their wick-
edness continually.

11 And  it  is  impossible  for  the 
tongue to describe, or for man to 
write a perfect description of the 
horrible  scene  of  the  blood  and 
carnage  which  was  among  the 
people,  both  of  the  Nephites  and 
of the Lamanites; and every heart 
was  hardened,  so  that  they  a de-
lighted  in  the  shedding  of  blood  
continually.

12 And  there  never  had  been  so 
great  a wickedness  among  all  the 
children of Lehi, nor even among 
all  the  house  of  Israel,  according 
to  the  words  of  the  Lord,  as  was 
among this people.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  did  take  possession  of 
the  city  Desolation,  and  this  be-
cause their a number did exceed the 
number of the Nephites.

14 And  they  did  also  march  for-
ward against the city Teancum, and 
did drive the inhabitants forth out 
of her, and did take many prisoners 
both women and children, and did 
offer  them  up  as  a sacrifices  unto 
their idol gods.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  in 
the  three  hundred  and  sixty  and 
seventh  year,  the  Nephites  being 
angry because the Lamanites had 
sacrificed  their  women  and  their 
children, that they did go against 
the  Lamanites  with  exceedingly 
great  anger,  insomuch  that  they 
did beat again the Lamanites, and 
drive them out of their lands.

16 And  the  Lamanites  did  not 
come  again  against  the  Nephites 
until  the  three  hundred  and  sev-
enty and fifth year.

17 And in this year they did come 
down against the Nephites with all 
their  powers;  and  they  were  not 
numbered because of the greatness 
of their number.

18 And a from this time forth did 
the Nephites gain no power over the 
Lamanites, but began to be swept 
off by them even as a dew before 
the sun.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come down against 
the a city Desolation; and there was 
an exceedingly sore battle fought in 
the land Desolation, in the which 
they did beat the Nephites.

20 And they fled again from be-
fore  them,  and  they  came  to  the 
city Boaz; and there they did stand 
against the Lamanites with exceed-
ing boldness, insomuch that the La-
manites did not beat them until they 
had come again the second time.

21 And when they had come the 
second  time,  the  Nephites  were 
driven  and  slaughtered  with  an 
exceedingly great slaughter; their 
women  and  their  a children  were 
again sacrificed unto idols.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites did again flee from before 
them, taking all the inhabitants with 
them, both in towns and villages.

23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that 
the Lamanites were about to over-
throw the land, therefore I did go 
to the hill a Shim, and did take up 
all  the  b records  which  Ammaron 
had hid up unto the Lord.

CHAPTER 5
Mormon again leads the Nephite armies 
in  battles  of  blood  and  carnage—The 
Book of Mormon will come forth to con- 
vince all Israel that Jesus is the Christ 
—Because of their unbelief, the Laman-
ites will be scattered, and the Spirit will 
cease to strive with them—They will re-
ceive the gospel from the Gentiles in the 
latter days. About a.d. 375–84.
And it came to pass that I did go 
forth among the Nephites, and did 
repent  of  the  a oath  which  I  had  
made that I would no more assist 
them; and they gave me command 
again  of  their  armies,  for  they 
looked upon me as though I could 
deliver them from their afflictions.
2 But behold, I was a without hope, 
for I knew the judgments of the Lord 
which should come upon them; for 
they repented not of their iniqui-
ties, but did struggle for their lives 
without  calling  upon  that  Being 
who created them.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come against us as 
we had fled to the city of Jordan; 
but behold, they were driven back 
that  they  did  not  take  the  city  at 
that time.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  against  us  again,  and  we 
did  maintain  the  city.  And  there 
were also other cities which were 
maintained by the Nephites, which 
strongholds did cut them off that 
they could not get into the country 
which lay before us, to destroy the 
inhabitants of our land.

5 But it came to pass that whatso-
ever lands we had passed by, and 
the  inhabitants  thereof  were  not 
gathered in, were destroyed by the 
Lamanites, and their towns, and vil-
lages, and cities were burned with 
fire;  and  thus  three  hundred  and 
seventy and nine years passed away.
6 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and eightieth year 
the  Lamanites  did  come  again 
against us to battle, and we did stand  
against them boldly; but it was all in 
vain, for so a great were their num-
bers that they did tread the people 
of the Nephites under their feet.

7 And it came to pass that we did  
again take to flight, and those whose 
flight was swifter than the Laman-
ites’  did  escape,  and  those  whose 
flight did not exceed the Lamanites’ 
were swept down and destroyed.

8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do 
not desire to harrow up the souls of 
men in casting before them such an 
awful scene of blood and carnage 
as was laid before mine eyes; but 
I, knowing that these things must 
surely  be  made  known,  and  that 
all  things  which  are  hid  must  be 
a revealed upon the house-tops—

9 And  also  that  a  knowledge  of 
these things must  a come unto the 
remnant of these people, and also 
unto  the  Gentiles,  who  the  Lord

hath said should b scatter this people, 
and this people should be counted 
as naught among them—therefore 
c I write a  d small abridgment, dar-
ing not to give a full account of the 
things which I have seen, because 
of the commandment which I have 
received,  and  also  that  ye  might 
not have too great sorrow because 
of the wickedness of this people.

10 And now behold, this I speak 
unto their seed, and also to the Gen-
tiles who have care for the house of 
Israel, that realize and know from 
whence their blessings come.

11 For I know that such will sor-
row for the calamity of the house 
of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for 
the destruction of this people; they 
will  sorrow  that  this  people  had 
not repented that they might have 
been clasped in the arms of Jesus.
12 Now a these things are b written 
unto the c remnant of the house of 
Jacob; and they are written after this 
manner, because it is known of God  
that wickedness will not bring them 
forth unto them; and they are to be 
d hid up unto the Lord that they may 
come forth in his own due time.

13 And this is the commandment 
which I have received; and behold, 
they  a shall  come  forth  accord-
ing  to  the  commandment  of  the 
Lord, when he shall see fit, in his  
wisdom.

14 And behold, they shall go unto 
the a unbelieving of the b Jews; and 
for this intent shall they go—that 
they may be c persuaded that Jesus 

is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God;  that  the  Father  may  bring 
about,  through  his  most  Beloved, 
his  great  and  eternal  purpose,  in 
restoring the Jews, or all the house 
of Israel, to the d land of their inheri-
tance,  which  the  Lord  their  God 
hath given them, unto the fulfilling 
of his e covenant;

15 And also that the seed of a this 
people may more fully believe his 
gospel, which shall b go forth unto 
them  from  the  Gentiles;  for  this 
people shall be c scattered, and shall 
d become a dark, a filthy, and a loath-
some people, beyond the descrip-
tion of that which ever hath been 
amongst  us,  yea,  even  that  which 
hath been among the Lamanites, and 
this because of their unbelief and  
idolatry.

16 For  behold,  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord hath already ceased to a strive 
with  their  fathers;  and  they  are 
without Christ and God in the world; 
and they are driven about as b chaff 
before the wind.

17 They were once a delightsome 
people, and they had Christ for their 
a shepherd; yea, they were led even 
by God the Father.

18 But now, behold, they are a led 
about  by  Satan,  even  as  chaff  is 
driven before the wind, or as a ves-
sel is tossed about upon the waves, 
without sail or anchor, or without 
anything  wherewith  to  steer  her; 
and even as she is, so are they.

served their blessings, which they

can  ye  stand  before  the  power  of 
God,  except  ye  shall  repent  and 
turn from your evil ways?

23 Know ye not that ye are in the 
a hands of God? Know ye not that 
he hath all power, and at his great 
command the b earth shall be c rolled 
together as a scroll?

24 Therefore, repent ye, and hum-
ble yourselves before him, lest he 
shall  come  out  in  justice  against 
you—lest a a remnant of the seed of 
Jacob shall go forth among you as 
a b lion, and tear you in pieces, and 
there is none to deliver.

CHAPTER 6
The Nephites gather to the land of Cu-
morah for the final battles—Mormon 
hides the sacred records in the hill Cu-
morah—The Lamanites are victorious, 
and the Nephite nation is destroyed—
Hundreds of thousands are slain with 
the sword. About a.d. 385.
And now I finish my record concern-
ing the a destruction of my people, 
the Nephites. And it came to pass 

that we did march forth before the 
Lamanites.

2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epis-
tle unto the king of the Lamanites, 
and desired of him that he would 
grant unto us that we might gather 
together our people unto the a land 
of  b Cumorah, by a hill which was 
called Cumorah, and there we could 
give them battle.

3 And it came to pass that the king 
of the Lamanites did grant unto me 
the thing which I desired.

4 And it came to pass that we did 
march forth to the land of Cumorah, 
and we did pitch our tents around 
about the hill Cumorah; and it was in 
a land of   a many waters, rivers, and  
fountains; and here we had hope to 
gain advantage over the Lamanites.
5 And when  a three hundred and 
eighty  and  four  years  had  passed 
away,  we  had  gathered  in  all  the 
remainder of our people unto the 
land of Cumorah.

6 And it came to pass that when 
we had gathered in all our people 
in one to the land of Cumorah, be-
hold I, Mormon, began to be old; and 
knowing it to be the last struggle of 
my people, and having been com-
manded of the Lord that I should 
not  suffer  the  records  which  had 
been handed down by our fathers, 
which were a sacred, to fall into the 
hands  of  the  Lamanites,  (for  the 
Lamanites  would  b destroy  them) 
therefore  I  made  c this  record  out 
of the plates of Nephi, and d hid up 
in the hill Cumorah all the records 
which had been entrusted to me by 
the hand of the Lord, save it were 
e these few plates which I gave unto 
my son f  Moroni.

MORMON 6  : 7–22

7 And it came to pass that my peo-
ple, with their wives and their chil-
dren, did now behold the  a armies 
of the Lamanites marching towards 
them; and with that awful b fear of 
death which fills the breasts of all 
the  wicked,  did  they  await  to  re-
ceive them.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came to battle against us, and every 
soul was filled with terror because 
of the greatness of their numbers.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did fall upon my people with the 
sword, and with the bow, and with 
the arrow, and with the ax, and with 
all manner of weapons of war.

10 And it came to pass that my men 
were hewn down, yea, even my a ten 
thousand who were with me, and I 
fell wounded in the midst; and they 
passed by me that they did not put 
an end to my life.

11 And when they had gone through  
and hewn down a all my people save 
it were twenty and four of us, (among 
whom  was  my  son  Moroni)  and  
we having survived the dead of our 
people, did behold on the morrow, 
when the Lamanites had returned 
unto their camps, from the top of 
the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand 
of my people who were hewn down, 
being led in the front by me.

12 And  we  also  beheld  the  ten 
thousand of my people who were 
led by my son Moroni.

13 And behold, the ten thousand 
of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he 
also in the midst.

14 And Lamah had fallen with his 
ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen 
with  his  ten  thousand;  and  Lim-
hah had fallen with his ten thou-
sand; and Jeneum had fallen with 
his ten thousand; and Cumenihah, 
and  Moronihah,  and  Antionum, 
and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, 

had fallen with their ten thousand  
each.

15 And it came to pass that there 
were ten more who did fall by the 
sword, with their ten thousand each; 
yea, even a all my people, save it were 
those  twenty  and  four  who  were 
with me, and also a b few who had 
escaped  into  the  south  countries, 
and a few who had deserted over 
unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and 
their  flesh,  and  bones,  and  blood 
lay upon the face of the earth, being 
left by the hands of those who slew 
them to molder upon the land, and 
to crumble and to return to their 
mother earth.

16 And my soul was rent with a an-
guish,  because  of  the  slain  of  my 
people, and I cried:

17 a O ye fair ones, how could ye 
have departed from the ways of the 
Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye 
have rejected that Jesus, who stood 
with open arms to receive you!

18 Behold, if ye had not done this, 
ye would not have fallen. But behold,  
ye are fallen, and I a mourn your loss.
19 O ye a fair sons and daughters, 
ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands 
and  wives,  ye  fair  ones,  how  is  it 
that ye could have b fallen!

20 But behold, ye are gone, and my 
sorrows cannot bring your return.
21 And the day soon cometh that 
your  mortal  must  put  on  immor-
tality, and these bodies which are 
now moldering in corruption must 
soon become a incorruptible bodies;  
and  then  ye  must  stand  before 
the judgment-seat of Christ, to be 
judged  according  to  your  works; 
and if it so be that ye are righteous, 
then are ye blessed with your fathers 
who have gone before you.

22 O that ye had repented before 
this  great  a destruction  had  come 
upon you. But behold, ye are gone,

and  the  Father,  yea,  the  Eternal

state;  and  he  doeth  with  you  ac-

CHAPTER 7

Mormon invites the Lamanites of the 
latter days to believe in Christ, accept 
His gospel, and be saved—All who be-
lieve the Bible will also believe the Book 
of Mormon. About a.d. 385.
And  now,  behold,  I  would  speak 
somewhat unto the a remnant of this 
people who are spared, if it so be 
that God may give unto them my 
words, that they may know of the 
things of their fathers; yea, I speak 
unto you, ye remnant of the house 
of Israel; and these are the words 
which I speak:

2 Know ye that ye are of the a house 

of Israel.

3 Know ye that ye must come unto 
repentance, or ye cannot be saved.
4 Know ye that ye must lay down 
your weapons of war, and delight no 
more in the shedding of blood, and  
take them not again, save it be that 
God shall a command you.

5 Know ye that ye must come to 
the a knowledge of your fathers, and 
repent of all your sins and iniquities, 
and b believe in Jesus Christ, that he 
is the Son of God, and that he was 
slain by the Jews, and by the power 
of the Father he hath risen again, 
whereby  he  hath  gained  the  c vic-
tory over the grave; and also in him 
is the sting of death swallowed up.

6 And he bringeth to pass the a res-
urrection of the dead, whereby man 
must be raised to stand before his 
b judgment-seat.

7 And he hath brought to pass the 
a redemption of the b world, whereby 
he that is found c guiltless before him 
at the judgment day hath it given 
unto him to d dwell in the presence 
of God in his kingdom, to sing cease-
less praises with the e choirs above, 
unto the Father, and unto the Son, 
and unto the Holy Ghost, which are 
f one God, in a state of  g happiness 
which hath no end.

8 Therefore repent, and be baptized  
in the name of Jesus, and lay hold 
upon the  a gospel of Christ, which 
shall be set before you, not only in 
this record but also in the record 
which shall come unto the Gentiles 
b from the Jews, which record shall 
come from the Gentiles c unto you.
9 For behold, a this is b written for 
the  intent  that  ye  may  c believe 
that; and if d ye believe that ye will 
believe this also; and if ye believe 
this ye will know concerning your 
fathers,  and  also  the  marvelous 
works which were wrought by the 
power of God among them.

10 And ye will also know that ye 
are a a remnant of the seed of Jacob; 
therefore ye are numbered among 
the people of the first covenant; and 
if it so be that ye believe in Christ, 
and are baptized, first b with water, 
then  with  fire  and  with  the  Holy 
Ghost,  following  the  c example  of 
our Savior, according to that which

he hath commanded us, it shall be 
well with you in the day of judg-
ment. Amen.

CHAPTER 8
The  Lamanites  seek  out  and  destroy 
the  Nephites—The  Book  of  Mormon 
will come forth by the power of God—
Woes  pronounced  upon  those  who 
breathe out wrath and strife against the 
work of the Lord—The Nephite record 
will  come  forth  in  a  day  of  wicked-
ness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About  
a.d. 400–421.
Behold  I,  a Moroni,  do  finish  the 
b record of my father, Mormon. Be-
hold, I have but few things to write,  
which  things  I  have  been  com-
manded by my father.

2 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
after  the  a great  and  tremendous 
battle  at  Cumorah,  behold,  the 
Nephites who had escaped into the 
country southward were hunted by 
the b Lamanites, until they were all  
destroyed.

3 And my father also was killed by 
them, and I even a remain b alone to 
write the sad tale of the destruction 
of my people. But behold, they are 
gone, and I fulfil the commandment 
of my father. And whether they will 
slay me, I know not.

4 Therefore I will write and a hide 
up  the  records  in  the  earth;  and 
whither I go it mattereth not.

5 Behold,  my  father  hath  made 
a this  record,  and  he  hath  written 
the  intent  thereof.  And  behold,  I 
would  write  it  also  if  I  had  room 
upon  the  b plates,  but  I  have  not; 
and ore I have none, for I am alone. 
My father hath been slain in battle, 
and all my kinsfolk, and I have not 

friends nor whither to go; and c how 
long the Lord will suffer that I may 
live I know not.

6 Behold, a four hundred years have 
passed  away  since  the  coming  of 
our Lord and Savior.

7 And behold, the Lamanites have 
hunted  my  people,  the  Nephites, 
down  from  city  to  city  and  from 
place to place, even until they are 
no more; and great has been their 
a fall;  yea,  great  and  marvelous  is 
the destruction of my people, the 
Nephites.

8 And behold, it is the hand of the 
Lord which hath done it. And behold 
also, the Lamanites are at a war one 
with another; and the whole face of 
this land is one continual round of 
murder and bloodshed; and no one 
knoweth the end of the war.

9 And now, behold, I say no more 
concerning them, for there are none 
save it be the Lamanites and a rob-
bers that do exist upon the face of 
the land.

10 And  there  are  none  that  do 
know  the  true  God  save  it  be  the 
a disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in 
the land until the wickedness of the 
people was so great that the Lord 
would not suffer them to  b remain 
with the people; and whether they 
be upon the face of the land no man  
knoweth.

11 But  behold,  my  a father  and  I 
have  seen  b them,  and  they  have 
ministered unto us.

12 And whoso receiveth a this record,  
and shall not condemn it because of 
the imperfections which are in it, the 
same shall know of b greater things 
than  these.  Behold,  I  am  Moroni;  
and were it possible, I would make 
all things known unto you.

482

13 Behold, I make an end of speak-
ing concerning this people. I am the 
son of Mormon, and my father was 
a a descendant of Nephi.

14 And I am the same who  a hid-
eth up this record unto the Lord; 
the plates thereof are of no worth, 
because  of  the  commandment  of 
the Lord. For he truly saith that no 
one  shall  have  them  b to  get  gain; 
but the record thereof is of c great 
worth; and whoso shall bring it to 
light, him will the Lord bless.

15 For  none  can  have  power  to 
bring it to light save it be given him 
of God; for God wills that it shall 
be done with an a eye single to his 
glory, or the welfare of the ancient 
and long dispersed covenant people 
of the Lord.

16 And blessed be  a he that shall 
bring this thing to light; for it shall 
be  b brought  out  of  darkness  unto 
light, according to the word of God; 
yea, it shall be brought out of the 
earth, and it shall shine forth out of 
darkness, and come unto the knowl-
edge of the people; and it shall be 
done by the power of God.

17 And  if  there  be  a faults  they  
be the faults of a man. But behold, 
we  know  no  fault;  nevertheless 
God knoweth all things; therefore, 
he  that  b condemneth,  let  him  be 
aware lest he shall be in danger of  
hell fire.

18 And he that saith: Show unto 
me, or ye shall be a smitten—let him 
beware  lest  he  commandeth  that 
which is forbidden of the Lord.

19 For behold, the same that a judg-
eth b rashly shall be judged rashly 

again;  for  according  to  his  works 
shall  his  wages  be;  therefore,  he 
that smiteth shall be smitten again, 
of the Lord.

20 Behold  what  the  scripture 
says—man shall not a smite, neither 
shall  he  b judge;  for  judgment  is 
mine, saith the Lord, and vengeance 
is mine also, and I will repay.

21 And he that shall breathe out 
a wrath and b strifes against the work 
of the Lord, and against the  c cov-
enant people of the Lord who are 
the house of Israel, and shall say: We 
will destroy the work of the Lord, 
and  the  Lord  will  not  remember 
his covenant which he hath made 
unto the house of Israel—the same 
is in danger to be hewn down and 
cast into the fire;

22 For  the  eternal  a purposes  of 
the Lord shall roll on, until all his 
promises shall be fulfilled.

23 Search the prophecies of  a Isaiah.  
Behold, I cannot write them. Yea, be-
hold I say unto you, that those saints 
who have gone before me, who have 
possessed this land, shall b cry, yea, 
even from the dust will they cry unto 
the Lord; and as the Lord liveth he 
will remember the covenant which 
he hath made with them.

24 And he knoweth their a prayers, 
that  they  were  in  behalf  of  their 
brethren.  And  he  knoweth  their 
faith, for in his name could they re-
move b mountains; and in his name 
could they cause the earth to shake; 
and by the power of his word did 
they cause c prisons to tumble to the 
earth; yea, even the fiery furnace 
could not harm them, neither wild

25 And  behold,  their  a prayers 
were also in behalf of him that the 
Lord  should  suffer  to  bring  these 
things forth.

26 And no one need say they shall 
not come, for they surely shall, for 
the Lord hath spoken it; for a out of 
the earth shall they come, by the 
hand of the Lord, and none can stay 
it; and it shall come in a day when it  
shall be said that b miracles are done 
away; and it shall come even as if 
one should speak c from the dead.

27 And it shall come in a day when 
the a blood of saints shall cry unto 
the Lord, because of secret b combi-
nations and the works of darkness.
28 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
the power of God shall be a denied, 
and b churches become defiled and 
be  c lifted up in the pride of their 
hearts; yea, even in a day when lead-
ers of churches and teachers shall 
rise  in  the  pride  of  their  hearts, 
even to the envying of them who 
belong to their churches.

29 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
a there shall be heard of fires, and 
tempests, and b vapors of smoke in 
foreign lands;

30 And there shall also be heard 
of a wars, rumors of wars, and earth-
quakes in divers places.

31 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
there shall be great a pollutions upon 
the face of the earth; there shall be 
b murders, and robbing, and lying, 

and deceivings, and whoredoms, and 
all manner of abominations; when 
there shall be many who will say, 
Do this, or do that, and it c mattereth  
not, for the Lord will d uphold such 
at the last day. But wo unto such, 
for they are in the  e gall of bitter-
ness and in the f  bonds of iniquity.
32 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
there  shall  be  a churches  built  up 
that shall say: Come unto me, and 
for  your  money  you  shall  be  for-
given of your sins.

33 O ye wicked and perverse and 
a stiffnecked  people,  why  have  ye 
built up churches unto yourselves 
to get  b gain? Why have ye  c trans-
figured the holy word of God, that 
ye  might  bring  d damnation  upon 
your  souls?  Behold,  look  ye  unto 
the e revelations of God; for behold, 
the time cometh at that day when 
all these things must be fulfilled.

34 Behold,  the  Lord  hath  shown 
unto me great and marvelous things 
concerning that which must shortly 
come, at that day when these things 
shall come forth among you.

35 Behold, I speak unto you as if  
ye were present, and yet ye are not.  
But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown 
you  unto  me,  and  I  know  your  
doing.

36 And I know that ye do a walk in 
the pride of your hearts; and there 
are  none  save  a  few  only  who  do 
not b lift themselves up in the pride 
of their hearts, unto the wearing of 
c very  fine  apparel,  unto  envying,

and strifes, and malice, and persecu-
tions, and all manner of iniquities; 
and your churches, yea, even every 
one, have become polluted because  
of the pride of your hearts.

37 For behold, ye do love a money, 
and your substance, and your fine 
apparel, and the adorning of your 
churches,  more  than  ye  love  the 
poor  and  the  needy,  the  sick  and 
the afflicted.

38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, 
ye teachers, who sell yourselves for 
that which will canker, why have 
ye polluted the holy church of God? 
Why are ye a ashamed to take upon 
you the name of Christ? Why do ye 
not think that greater is the value 
of an endless happiness than that 
b misery which never dies—because 
of the c praise of the world?

39 Why  do  ye  adorn  yourselves 
with that which hath no life, and 
yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, 
and the naked, and the sick and the 
afflicted to pass by you, and notice 
them not?

40 Yea, why do ye build up your 
a secret abominations to get gain, and 
cause  that  widows  should  mourn 
before the Lord, and also orphans 
to mourn before the Lord, and also 
the blood of their fathers and their 
husbands to cry unto the Lord from 
the  ground,  for  vengeance  upon 
your heads?

41 Behold, the sword of vengeance 
hangeth over you; and the time soon 
cometh that he avengeth the a blood 
of the saints upon you, for he will 
not suffer their cries any longer.

CHAPTER 9

Moroni calls upon those who do not be-
lieve in Christ to repent—He proclaims 

a God of miracles, who gives revelations 
and  pours  out  gifts  and  signs  upon 
the  faithful—Miracles  cease  because 
of  unbelief—Signs  follow  those  who 
believe—Men are exhorted to be wise 
and  keep  the  commandments.  About  
a.d. 401–21.
And now, I speak also concerning 
those who do not believe in Christ.
2 Behold, will ye believe in the day 
of  your  visitation—behold,  when 
the Lord shall come, yea, even that 
a great day when the b earth shall be 
rolled together as a scroll, and the 
elements  shall  c melt  with  fervent 
heat, yea, in that great day when 
ye shall be brought to stand before 
the Lamb of God—then will ye say 
that there is no God?

3 Then  will  ye  longer  deny  the 
Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb 
of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall 
dwell with him under a a conscious-
ness of your guilt? Do ye suppose 
that ye could be happy to dwell with 
that  holy  Being,  when  your  souls 
are  racked  with  a  consciousness 
of  guilt  that  ye  have  ever  abused  
his laws?

4 Behold, I say unto you that ye 
would be more miserable to dwell 
with a holy and just God, under a 
consciousness  of  your  a filthiness 
before him, than ye would to dwell 
with the b damned souls in c hell.

5 For  behold,  when  ye  shall  be 
brought to see your a nakedness be-
fore God, and also the glory of God, 
and the b holiness of Jesus Christ, it 
will kindle a flame of unquench-
able fire upon you.

6 O then ye a unbelieving, b turn ye 
unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the 
Father  in  the  name  of  Jesus,  that 
perhaps ye may be found spotless,

c pure, fair, and white, having been 
cleansed by the blood of the d Lamb, 
at that great and last day.

7 And again I speak unto you who 
a deny the revelations of God, and say 
that they are done away, that there 
are no revelations, nor prophecies, 
nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking  
with tongues, and the b interpreta-
tion of tongues;

8 Behold I say unto you, he that 
denieth these things knoweth not 
the a gospel of Christ; yea, he has not 
read the scriptures; if so, he does 
not b understand them.

9 For do we not read that God is the 
a same b yesterday, today, and forever, 
and in him there is no c variableness 
neither shadow of changing?

10 And now, if ye have imagined 
up unto yourselves a god who doth 
vary, and in whom there is shadow 
of changing, then have ye imagined 
up unto yourselves a god who is not 
a God of miracles.

11 But behold, I will show unto you 
a  God  of  a miracles,  even  the  God 
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, 
and the God of Jacob; and it is that 
same b God who created the heavens 
and the earth, and all things that  
in them are.

12 Behold, he created Adam, and 
by  a Adam  came  the  b fall  of  man. 
And because of the fall of man came 
Jesus  Christ,  even  the  Father  and 
the Son; and because of Jesus Christ  
came the c redemption of man.

13 And  because  of  the  redemp-
tion of man, which came by Jesus 
Christ, they are brought back into 

the a presence of the Lord; yea, this 
is wherein all men are redeemed, 
because the death of Christ bringeth 
to  pass  the  b resurrection,  which 
bringeth to pass a redemption from 
an endless c sleep, from which sleep 
all men shall be awakened by the 
power of God when the trump shall 
sound; and they shall come forth, 
both small and great, and all shall 
stand  before  his  bar,  being  re-
deemed and loosed from this eter-
nal d band of death, which death is a  
temporal death.

14 And then cometh the a judgment 
of  the  Holy  One  upon  them;  and 
then cometh the time that he that 
is  b filthy  shall  be  filthy  still;  and 
he that is righteous shall be righ-
teous still; he that is happy shall be 
happy still; and he that is unhappy 
shall be unhappy still.

15 And  now,  O  all  ye  that  have 
imagined up unto yourselves a god 
who can do  a no miracles, I would 
ask  of  you,  have  all  these  things 
passed, of which I have spoken? Has 
the end come yet? Behold I say unto 
you, Nay; and God has not ceased 
to be a God of miracles.

16 Behold, are not the things that 
God hath wrought marvelous in our 
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend 
the marvelous a works of God?

17 Who shall say that it was not 
a  miracle  that  by  his  a word  the 
heaven and the earth should be; and 
by the power of his word man was 
b created of the  c dust of the earth; 
and by the power of his word have 
miracles been wrought?

18 And  who  shall  say  that  Jesus 
Christ  did  not  do  many  mighty 
a miracles?  And  there  were  many 
b mighty  miracles  wrought  by  the 
hands of the apostles.

19 And  if  there  were  a miracles 
wrought then, why has God ceased 
to be a God of miracles and yet be 
an  unchangeable  Being?  And  be-
hold, I say unto you he b changeth 
not; if so he would cease to be God; 
and he ceaseth not to be God, and 
is a God of miracles.

20 And the reason why he ceaseth 
to do a miracles among the children 
of men is because that they dwindle 
in  unbelief,  and  depart  from  the 
right way, and know not the God 
in whom they should b trust.

21 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  that 
whoso believeth in Christ, doubting 
nothing,  a whatsoever he shall ask 
the  Father  in  the  name  of  Christ 
it  shall  be  granted  him;  and  this 
b promise is unto all, even unto the 
ends of the earth.

22 For  behold,  thus  said  Jesus 
Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  unto  his 
disciples  who  should  tarry,  yea, 
and also to a all his disciples, in the 
hearing  of  the  multitude:  Go  ye 
into all the world, and preach the 
gospel to every creature;

23 And he that  a believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved, but he that 
believeth not shall be b damned;

24 And  a these  signs  shall  follow 
them  that  believe—in  my  name 
shall they cast out b devils; they shall 
speak with new tongues; they shall 

take up serpents; and if they drink 
any deadly thing it shall not hurt 
them; they shall lay c hands on the 
sick and they shall recover;

25 And whosoever shall believe in 
my name, doubting nothing, unto 
him will I a confirm all my words, 
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 And now, behold, who can stand 
a against  the  works  of  the  Lord? 
b Who  can  deny  his  sayings?  Who 
will  rise  up  against  the  almighty 
power  of  the  Lord?  Who  will  de-
spise the works of the Lord? Who 
will despise the children of Christ? 
Behold, all ye who are c despisers of 
the works of the Lord, for ye shall 
wonder and perish.

27 O then despise not, and wonder 
not, but hearken unto the words of 
the Lord, and ask the Father in the 
name of Jesus for what things so-
ever ye shall stand in need. a Doubt 
not, but be believing, and begin as 
in times of old, and b come unto the 
Lord with all your c heart, and d work 
out  your  own  salvation  with  fear 
and trembling before him.

28 Be  a wise  in  the  days  of  your 
b probation;  strip  yourselves  of  all 
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may 
consume it on your c lusts, but ask 
with a firmness unshaken, that ye 
will  yield  to  no  temptation,  but 
that  ye  will  serve  the  true  and  
d living God.

29 See  that  ye  are  not  baptized 
a unworthily;  see  that  ye  partake 
not  of  the  sacrament  of  Christ 
b unworthily; but see that ye do all

things in c worthiness, and do it in 
the name of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of the living God; and if ye do this, 
and endure to the end, ye will in 
nowise be cast out.

30 Behold,  I  speak  unto  you  as 
though I a spake from the dead; for 
I know that ye shall have my words.
31 Condemn  me  not  because  of 
mine  a imperfection,  neither  my 
father, because of his imperfection, 
neither them who have written be-
fore  him;  but  rather  give  thanks 
unto God that he hath made mani-
fest  unto  you  our  imperfections, 
that ye may learn to be more wise 
than we have been.

32 And now, behold, we have writ-
ten  this  record  according  to  our 
knowledge, in the characters which 
are called among us the a reformed 
Egyptian, being handed down and 
altered by us, according to our man-
ner of speech.

33 And  if  our  plates  had  been 
a sufficiently large we should have 
written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew 
hath been altered by us also; and if 

we could have written in Hebrew, 
behold, ye would have had no b im-
perfection in our record.

34 But the Lord knoweth the things 
which  we  have  written,  and  also 
that none other people knoweth our 
language;  and  because  that  none 
other people knoweth our language, 
therefore he hath prepared a means 
for the interpretation thereof.

35 And  these  things  are  written 
that  we  may  rid  our  garments  of 
the  blood  of  our  a brethren,  who 
have dwindled in unbelief.

36 And behold, these things which 
we  have  a desired  concerning  our 
brethren,  yea,  even  their  restora-
tion to the knowledge of Christ, are 
according to the prayers of all the 
saints who have dwelt in the land.
37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ 
grant  that  their  prayers  may  be 
answered according to their faith; 
and may God the Father remember 
the covenant which he hath made 
with the house of Israel; and may 
he bless them forever, through faith 
on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

33 Which a Jared came forth with 
his brother and their families, with 
some others and their families, from 
the great tower, at the time the Lord 
b confounded  the  language  of  the 
people, and swore in his wrath that 
they should be scattered upon all 
the c face of the earth; and according 
to the word of the Lord the people 
were scattered.

34 And the  a brother of Jared be-
ing  a  large  and  mighty  man,  and 
a man highly favored of the Lord, 
Jared, his brother, said unto him: 
Cry unto the Lord, that he will not 
confound us that we may not b un-
derstand our words.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did cry unto the 
Lord, and the Lord had compassion 
upon  Jared;  therefore  he  did  not 
confound  the  a language  of  Jared; 
and Jared and his brother were not 
confounded.

36 Then  Jared  said  unto  his 
brother: Cry again unto the Lord, 
and it may be that he will turn away 
his anger from them who are our 
a friends, that he confound not their  
language.

3 And as I suppose that the a first 
part  of  this  record,  which  speaks 
concerning  the  creation  of  the 
world,  and  also  of  Adam,  and  an 
account from that time even to the 
great b tower, and whatsoever things 
transpired among the children of 
men until that time, is had among 
the Jews—

4 Therefore  I  do  not  write  those 
things which transpired from the 
a days of Adam until that time; but 
they are had upon the plates; and 
whoso findeth them, the same will 
have power that he may get the full 
account.

5 But  behold,  I  give  not  the  full 
account, but a a part of the account 
I give, from the tower down until 
they were destroyed.

6 And on this wise do I give the 
account. He that wrote this record 
was  a Ether,  and  he  was  a  descen-
dant of Coriantor.

7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.
8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.
9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.
10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.
11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.
12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.
13 And Com was the son of Cori-

antum.

14 And Coriantum was the son of 

Amnigaddah.

15 And Amnigaddah was the son 

of Aaron.

16 And Aaron was a descendant of 
Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.
17 And Hearthom was the son of 

Lib.

18 And Lib was the son of Kish.
19 And Kish was the son of Corom.
20 And Corom was the son of Levi.
21 And Levi was the son of Kim.

Morianton.

upon their friends and their families  
also, that they were not confounded.
38 And it came to pass that Jared 
spake again unto his brother, say-
ing:  Go  and  a inquire  of  the  Lord 
whether he will drive us out of the 
land, and if he will drive us out of 
the land, cry unto him whither we 
shall go. And who knoweth but the 
Lord will carry us forth into a land 
which is b choice above all the earth? 
And  if  it  so  be,  let  us  be  faithful 
unto the Lord, that we may receive 
it for our inheritance.

39 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did cry unto the 
Lord according to that which had 
been spoken by the mouth of Jared.
40 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did hear the brother of Jared, 
and  a had  compassion  upon  him, 
and said unto him:

41 Go to and gather together thy 
a flocks,  both  male  and  female,  of 
every kind; and also of the b seed of 
the  earth  of  every  kind;  and  c thy 
d families; and also Jared thy brother 
and his family; and also thy e friends 
and their families, and the friends 
of Jared and their families.

42 And when thou hast done this 
thou shalt a go at the head of them 
down into the valley which is north-
ward. And there will I meet thee, 
and  I  will  go  b before  thee  into  a 
land which is c choice above all the 
lands of the earth.

43 And there will I bless thee and 
thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy 
seed, and of the seed of thy brother, 
and  they  who  shall  go  with  thee, 
a great nation. And a there shall be 
none b greater than the nation which 
I will raise up unto me of thy seed, 
upon all the face of the earth. And 

thus I will do unto thee because this 
long time ye have cried unto me.

CHAPTER 2

The  Jaredites  prepare  for  their  jour-
ney to a promised land—It is a choice 
land  whereon  men  must  serve  Christ 
or be swept off—The Lord talks to the 
brother of Jared for three hours—The 
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks 
the brother of Jared to propose how the 
barges will be lighted.
And it came to pass that Jared and 
his  brother,  and  their  families,  
and also the a friends of Jared and 
his brother and their families, went 
down  into  the  valley  which  was 
northward,  (and  the  name  of  the 
valley  was  b Nimrod,  being  called 
after the mighty hunter) with their 
c flocks which they had gathered to-
gether, male and female, of every  
kind.

2 And they did also lay snares and 
catch  a fowls  of  the  air;  and  they 
did also prepare a vessel, in which 
they did carry with them the fish 
of the waters.

3 And  they  did  also  carry  with 
them deseret, which, by interpreta-
tion, is a honey bee; and thus they 
did carry with them a swarms of bees, 
and all manner of that which was 
upon  the  face  of  the  land,  b seeds 
of every kind.

4 And it came to pass that when 
they had come down into the valley 
of Nimrod the Lord came down and 
talked with the brother of Jared; and 
he was in a a cloud, and the brother 
of Jared saw him not.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord 
commanded them that they should 
a go forth into the wilderness, yea,

into that quarter where there never 
had man been. And it came to pass 
that the Lord did go before them, 
and did talk with them as he stood 
in  a  b cloud,  and  gave  c directions 
whither they should travel.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they  
did travel in the wilderness, and did 
a build  b barges,  in  which  they  did 
cross many waters, being directed 
continually by the hand of the Lord.
7 And the Lord would not suffer 
that they should stop beyond the 
sea in the wilderness, but he would 
that they should come forth even 
unto  the  a land  of  promise,  which 
was  choice  above  all  other  lands, 
which the Lord God had b preserved 
for a righteous people.

8 And he had sworn in his wrath 
unto  the  brother  of  Jared,  that 
whoso should possess this land of 
promise, from that time henceforth 
and forever, should a serve him, the 
true and only God, or they should 
be  b swept off when the fulness of 
his wrath should come upon them.
9 And now, we can behold the de-
crees of God concerning this land, 
that  it  is  a  land  of  promise;  and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it 
shall  serve  God,  or  they  shall  be 
a swept off when the fulness of his 
b wrath shall come upon them. And 
the  fulness  of  his  wrath  cometh 
upon them when they are c ripened  
in iniquity.

10 For behold, this is a land which 
is  choice  above  all  other  lands; 
wherefore  he  that  doth  possess  it 
shall serve God or shall be a swept 
off; for it is the everlasting decree of 
God. And it is not until the b fulness 
of iniquity among the children of 
the land, that they are c swept off.

11 And  this  cometh  unto  you,  O 
ye a Gentiles, that ye may know the 
decrees of God—that ye may repent, 
and  not  continue  in  your  iniqui-
ties  until  the  fulness  come,  that  
ye may not bring down the fulness 
of the  b wrath of God upon you as 
the  inhabitants  of  the  land  have  
hitherto done.

12 Behold,  this  is  a  choice  land, 
and  whatsoever  nation  shall  pos-
sess it shall be a free from bondage, 
and  from  captivity,  and  from  all 
other nations under heaven, if they 
will but b serve the God of the land, 
who is Jesus Christ, who hath been 
manifested by the things which we 
have written.

13 And  now  I  proceed  with  my 
record; for behold, it came to pass 
that the Lord did bring Jared and 
his brethren forth even to that great 
sea which divideth the lands. And 
as they came to the sea they pitched 
their  tents;  and  they  called  the 
name  of  the  place  a Moriancumer; 
and they dwelt in b tents, and dwelt 
in tents upon the seashore for the 
space of four years.

14 And it came to pass at the end 
of  four  years  that  the  Lord  came 
again  unto  the  brother  of  Jared, 
and  stood  in  a  cloud  and  a talked 
with him. And for the space of three 
hours  did  the  Lord  talk  with  the 
brother  of  Jared,  and  b chastened 
him  because  he  remembered  not 
to c call upon the name of the Lord.
15 And  the  brother  of  Jared  re-
pented of the evil which he had done, 
and did call upon the name of the 
Lord for his brethren who were with 
him. And the Lord said unto him: I 
will forgive thee and thy brethren 
of their sins; but thou shalt not sin

any more, for ye shall remember that 
my  a Spirit  will  not  always  b strive 
with man; wherefore, if ye will sin 
until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut  
off from the presence of the Lord. 
And these are my  c thoughts upon 
the land which I shall give you for 
your inheritance; for it shall be a 
land d choice above all other lands.
16 And the Lord said: Go to work 
and  build,  after  the  manner  of 
a barges  which  ye  have  hitherto 
built. And it came to pass that the 
brother of Jared did go to work, and 
also his brethren, and built barges 
after the manner which they had 
built, according to the b instructions 
of the Lord. And they were small, 
and they were light upon the wa-
ter, even like unto the lightness of 
a fowl upon the water.

17 And  they  were  built  after  a 
manner that they were exceedingly 
a tight, even that they would hold wa-
ter like unto a dish; and the bottom 
thereof was tight like unto a dish; 
and the sides thereof were tight like 
unto a dish; and the ends thereof 
were peaked; and the top thereof 
was tight like unto a dish; and the 
length thereof was the length of a 
tree;  and  the  door  thereof,  when 
it  was  shut,  was  tight  like  unto  
a dish.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared cried unto the Lord,  
saying: O Lord, I have performed the 
work which thou hast commanded 
me, and I have made the barges ac-
cording as thou hast directed me.

19 And  behold,  O  Lord,  in  them 
there is no light; whither shall we 
steer? And also we shall perish, for 
in them we cannot breathe, save it 
is the air which is in them; there-
fore we shall perish.

20 And  the  Lord  said  unto  the 
brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt 
make a hole in the top, and also in 
the  bottom;  and  when  thou  shalt 
suffer for air thou shalt unstop the 
hole and receive air. And if it be so 
that the water come in upon thee, 
behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye  
may not perish in the flood.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did so, according 
as the Lord had commanded.

22 And  he  cried  again  unto  the 
Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have 
done even as thou hast commanded 
me; and I have prepared the vessels 
for my people, and behold there is 
no light in them. Behold, O Lord, 
wilt thou suffer that we shall cross 
this great water in darkness?

23 And  the  Lord  said  unto  the 
brother of Jared: What will ye that 
I should do that ye may have light 
in your vessels? For behold, ye can-
not have a windows, for they will be 
dashed in pieces; neither shall ye 
take fire with you, for ye shall not 
go by the light of fire.

24 For  behold,  ye  shall  be  as  a 
a whale in the midst of the sea; for 
the mountain waves shall dash upon 
you. Nevertheless, I will bring you 
up again out of the depths of the 
sea; for the b winds have gone forth 
c out of my mouth, and also the d rains 
and the floods have I sent forth.

25 And  behold,  I  prepare  you 
against these things; for ye cannot 
cross this great deep save I prepare 
you against the waves of the sea, and 
the winds which have gone forth, 
and  the  floods  which  shall  come. 
Therefore what will ye that I should 
prepare for you that ye may have 
light when ye are swallowed up in 
the depths of the sea?

CHAPTER 3

The brother of Jared sees the finger of 
the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—
Christ  shows  His  spirit  body  to  the 
brother  of  Jared—Those  who  have  a 
perfect knowledge cannot be kept from 
within  the  veil—Interpreters  are  pro-
vided to bring the Jaredite record to light.

And it came to pass that the brother 
of Jared, (now the number of the 
vessels  which  had  been  prepared 
was  eight)  went  forth  unto  the 
a mount, which they called the mount  
b Shelem, because of its exceeding 
height, and did c molten out of a rock 
sixteen small stones; and they were 
white and clear, even as transpar-
ent  d glass; and he did carry them 
in  his  hands  upon  the  top  of  the 
mount,  and  cried  again  unto  the 
Lord, saying:

2 O Lord, thou hast said that we 
must be encompassed about by the 
floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do 
not be a angry with thy servant be-
cause of his weakness before thee; 
for we know that thou art holy and 
dwellest  in  the  heavens,  and  that 
we are b unworthy before thee; be-
cause of the c fall our d natures have 
become evil continually; neverthe-
less, O Lord, thou hast given us a 
commandment  that  we  must  call 
upon thee, that from thee we may 
receive according to our desires.

3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten 
us because of our iniquity, and hast 
driven us forth, and for these many 
years we have been in the wilder-
ness; nevertheless, thou hast been 
a merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon 
me in pity, and turn away thine an-
ger from this thy people, and suffer 
not that they shall go forth across 

this  raging  deep  in  darkness;  but 
behold these b things which I have 
molten out of the rock.

4 And I know, O Lord, that thou 
hast all  a power, and can do what-
soever thou wilt for the benefit of 
man; therefore touch these stones, O 
Lord, with thy b finger, and prepare 
them that they may shine forth in 
darkness; and they shall shine forth 
unto  us  in  the  vessels  which  we 
have prepared, that we may have 
c light while we shall cross the sea.
5 Behold,  O  Lord,  thou  canst  do 
this.  We  know  that  thou  art  able 
to  show  forth  great  power,  which 
a looks small unto the understand-
ing of men.

6 And it came to pass that when 
the brother of Jared had said these 
words, behold, the a Lord stretched 
forth  his  hand  and  touched  the 
stones one by one with his b finger. 
And the c veil was taken from off the 
eyes of the brother of Jared, and he 
saw the finger of the Lord; and it 
was as the finger of a man, like unto 
flesh and blood; and the brother of 
Jared  d fell  down  before  the  Lord, 
for he was struck with e fear.

7 And  the  Lord  saw  that  the 
brother of Jared had fallen to the 
earth; and the Lord said unto him: 
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

8 And  he  saith  unto  the  Lord:  I 
saw  the  finger  of  the  Lord,  and  
I feared lest he should  a smite me; 
for  I  knew  not  that  the  Lord  had 
flesh and blood.

9 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Because of thy faith thou hast seen 
that I shall take upon me a flesh and 
blood; and never has man come be-
fore me with b such exceeding faith 
as thou hast; for were it not so ye

could not have seen my finger. Saw-
est thou more than this?

10 And  he  answered:  Nay;  Lord, 

a show thyself unto me.

11 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
a Believest thou the words which I 
shall speak?

12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I 
know that thou speakest the truth, 
for  thou  art  a  God  of  truth,  and 
a canst not lie.

spirit will I appear unto my people 
in the flesh.

17 And  now,  as  I,  Moroni,  said  I 
could  a not make a full account of 
these  things  which  are  written, 
therefore  it  sufficeth  me  to  say 
that  Jesus  showed  himself  unto 
this  man  in  the  spirit,  even  after 
the manner and in the likeness of 
the same body even as he b showed 
himself unto the Nephites.

13 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words,  behold,  the  Lord  a showed 
himself  unto  him,  and  said:  b Be-
cause thou knowest these things ye 
are redeemed from the fall; there-
fore ye are brought back into my 
c presence; therefore I d show myself  
unto you.

14 Behold, I am he who was a pre-
pared from the foundation of the 
world to b redeem my people. Behold, 
I am Jesus Christ. I am the c Father 
and the Son. In me shall all man-
kind have d life, and that eternally, 
even they who shall believe on my 
name;  and  they  shall  become  my 
e sons and my daughters.

15 And never have I a showed my-
self unto man whom I have created, 
for never has man b believed in me 
as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are 
created after mine own c image? Yea, 
even  all  men  were  created  in  the 
beginning after mine own image.

16 Behold,  this  a body,  which  ye 
now  b behold,  is  the  c body  of  my 
d spirit; and man have I created af-
ter the body of my spirit; and even 
as I appear unto thee to be in the 

18 And  he  ministered  unto  him 
even  as  he  ministered  unto  the 
Nephites; and all this, that this man 
might know that he was God, because  
of the many great works which the 
Lord had showed unto him.

19 And because of the a knowledge 
of this man he could not be kept 
from beholding within the b veil; and 
he saw the finger of Jesus, which, 
when he saw, he fell with fear; for 
he knew that it was the finger of 
the Lord; and he had c faith no lon-
ger, for he knew, nothing d doubting.
20 Wherefore, having this perfect 
knowledge of God, he could a not be 
kept from within the veil; therefore 
he b saw Jesus; and he did minister 
unto him.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord said unto the brother of Jared: 
Behold, thou shalt not suffer these 
things which ye have seen and heard 
to go forth unto the world, until the 
a time cometh that I shall glorify my 
name  in  the  flesh;  wherefore,  ye 
shall b treasure up the things which 
ye have seen and heard, and show 
it to no man.

22 And behold, when ye shall come 
unto me, ye shall write them and 
shall seal them up, that no one can 
interpret them; for ye shall write 
them in a a language that they can-
not be read.

23 And behold, these a two stones 
will I give unto thee, and ye shall 
seal them up also with the things 
which ye shall write.

24 For behold, the a language which 
ye shall write I have confounded; 
wherefore I will cause in my own 
due  time  that  these  stones  shall 
magnify to the eyes of men these 
things which ye shall write.

25 And  when  the  Lord  had  said 
these words, he  a showed unto the 
brother  of  Jared  b all  the  inhabi-
tants of the earth which had been, 
and also all that would be; and he 
c withheld them not from his sight, 
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 For  he  had  said  unto  him  in 
times before, that a if he would b be-
lieve in him that he could show unto 
him c all things—it should be shown 
unto him; therefore the Lord could 
not withhold anything from him, 
for  he  knew  that  the  Lord  could 
show him all things.

27 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Write these things and a seal them 
up; and I will show them in mine 
own due time unto the children of  
men.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  commanded  him  that  he 
should seal up the two a stones which 
he had received, and show them not, 
until  the  Lord  should  show  them 
unto the children of b men.

CHAPTER 4

Moroni  is  commanded  to  seal  up  the 
writings of the brother of Jared—They 
will not be revealed until men have faith 
even  as  the  brother  of  Jared—Christ 
commands  men  to  believe  His  words 
and  those  of  His  disciples—Men  are 
commanded to repent, believe the gos-
pel, and be saved.

And  the  Lord  commanded  the 
brother of Jared to go down out of 
the a mount from the presence of the 
Lord, and b write the things which 
he had seen; and they were forbid-
den to come unto the children of 
men c until after that he should be 
lifted up upon the cross; and for this 
cause did king Mosiah keep them, 
that they should not come unto the 
world until after Christ should show 
himself unto his people.

2 And after Christ truly had showed  
himself  unto  his  people  he  com-
manded that they should be made 
manifest.

3 And now, after that, they have 
all dwindled in unbelief; and there 
is  a none save it be the Lamanites, 
and they have rejected the gospel of 
Christ; therefore I am commanded 
that I should b hide them up again 
in the earth.

4 Behold, I have written upon these 
plates the  a very things which the 
brother of Jared saw; and there never 
were  b greater  things  made  mani-
fest  than  those  which  were  made  
manifest unto the brother of Jared.
5 Wherefore the Lord hath com-
manded me to write them; and I have 
written them. And he commanded

me  that  I  should  a seal  them  up; 
and he also hath commanded that 
I should seal up the interpretation 
thereof; wherefore I have sealed up 
the b interpreters, according to the 
commandment of the Lord.

6 For the Lord said unto me: They 
shall not go forth unto the Gentiles 
until the day that they shall repent 
of their iniquity, and become clean 
before the Lord.

7 And in that day that they shall 
exercise a faith in me, saith the Lord, 
even as the brother of Jared did, that 
they may become b sanctified in me, 
then will I c manifest unto them the 
things which the brother of Jared 
saw,  even  to  the  unfolding  unto 
them all my d revelations, saith Jesus  
Christ, the Son of God, the e Father 
of the heavens and of the earth, and 
all things that in them are.

8 And he that will a contend against 
the  word  of  the  Lord,  let  him  be 
accursed; and he that shall  b deny 
these things, let him be accursed; 
for unto them will I show c no greater 
things, saith Jesus Christ; for I am 
he who speaketh.

9 And at my command the heav-
ens are opened and are a shut; and 
at my word the b earth shall shake; 
and at my command the inhabitants 
thereof shall pass away, even so as  
by fire.

10 And he that believeth not my 
words believeth not my disciples; 
and if it so be that I do not speak, 
judge ye; for ye shall know that it 
is I that speaketh, at the a last day.
11 But  he  that  a believeth  these 

things  which  I  have  spoken,  him 
will I visit with the manifestations 
of  my  Spirit,  and  he  shall  b know 
and  bear  record.  For  because  of 
my Spirit he shall c know that these 
things are  d true; for it persuadeth 
men to do good.

12 And whatsoever thing persuad-
eth  men  to  do  good  is  of  me;  for 
a good cometh of none save it be of 
me. I am the same that leadeth men 
to all good; he that will b not believe 
my words will not believe me—that 
I am; and he that will not believe me 
will not believe the Father who sent 
me. For behold, I am the Father, I 
am the c light, and the d life, and the  
e truth of the world.

13 a Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, 
and I will show unto you the greater 
things, the knowledge which is hid 
up because of unbelief.

14 Come unto me, O ye house of 
Israel, and it shall be made a mani-
fest unto you how great things the 
Father hath laid up for you, from 
the foundation of the world; and it 
hath not come unto you, because of  
unbelief.

15 Behold, when ye shall rend that 
veil of unbelief which doth cause 
you to remain in your awful state of 
wickedness, and hardness of heart, 
and blindness of mind, then shall 
the  great  and  marvelous  things 
which have been a hid up from the 
foundation of the world from you—
yea, when ye shall  b call upon the 
Father in my name, with a broken 
heart  and  a  contrite  spirit,  then 
shall ye know that the Father hath

remembered  the  covenant  which 
he made unto your fathers, O house 
of Israel.

16 And then shall my a revelations 
which I have caused to be written 
by my servant John be unfolded in 
the eyes of all the people. Remem-
ber,  when  ye  see  these  things,  ye 
shall know that the time is at hand 
that they shall be made manifest in  
very deed.

17 Therefore,  a when  ye  shall  re-
ceive this record ye may know that 
the  work  of  the  Father  has  com-
menced upon all the face of the land.
18 Therefore, a repent all ye ends 
of  the  earth,  and  come  unto  me, 
and believe in my gospel, and be 
b baptized in my name; for he that 
believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved; but he that believeth not shall 
be damned; and c signs shall follow 
them that believe in my name.

19 And blessed is he that is found 
a faithful unto my name at the last 
day,  for  he  shall  be  b lifted  up  to 
dwell in the kingdom prepared for 
him  c from  the  foundation  of  the 
world. And behold it is I that hath 
spoken it. Amen.

CHAPTER 5

Three witnesses and the work itself will 
stand as a testimony of the truthfulness 
of the Book of Mormon.
And  now  I,  Moroni,  have  written 
the words which were commanded 
me, according to my memory; and 
I have told you the things which I  
have  a sealed  up;  therefore  touch 
them  not  in  order  that  ye  may 
translate; for that thing is forbidden  

you,  except  by  and  by  it  shall  be 
wisdom in God.

2 And  behold,  ye  may  be  privi-
leged that ye may show the plates 
unto a those who shall assist to bring 
forth this work;

3 And  unto  a three  shall  they  be 
shown by the power of God; where-
fore  they  shall  b know  of  a  surety 
that these things are c true.

4 And in the mouth of three a wit-
nesses shall these things be estab-
lished; and the b testimony of three, 
and this work, in the which shall be 
shown forth the power of God and 
also his word, of which the Father, 
and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Ghost 
bear record—and all this shall stand 
as a testimony against the world at  
the last day.

5 And if it so be that they repent  
and  a come unto the Father in the  
name of Jesus, they shall be received 
into the kingdom of God.

6 And now, if I have no authority  
for these things, judge ye; for ye shall 
know  that  I  have  authority  when  
ye shall see me, and we shall stand 
before God at the last day. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

The Jaredite barges are driven by the 
winds to the promised land—The people 
praise the Lord for His goodness—Ori-
hah is appointed king over them—Jared 
and his brother die.

And now I, Moroni, proceed to give 
the record of a Jared and his brother.

had  prepared  the  a stones  which  
the brother of Jared had carried up  
into the mount, the brother of Jared

came down out of the mount, and 
he did put forth the stones into the 
vessels which were prepared, one 
in  each  end  thereof;  and  behold, 
they did give light unto the vessels.
3 And thus the Lord caused stones 
to shine in darkness, to give light 
unto men, women, and children, that 
they might not cross the great waters  
in darkness.

4 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  prepared  all  manner  of 
a food, that thereby they might sub-
sist upon the water, and also food for 
their flocks and herds, and b what-
soever beast or animal or fowl that 
they should carry with them—and 
it came to pass that when they had 
done all these things they got aboard 
of their vessels or barges, and set 
forth  into  the  sea,  commending 
themselves unto the Lord their God.
5 And it came to pass that the Lord 
God caused that there should be a 
a furious wind blow upon the face 
of the waters,  b towards the prom-
ised land; and thus they were tossed 
upon  the  waves  of  the  sea  before 
the wind.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were  many  times  buried  in  the 
depths  of  the  sea,  because  of  the 
mountain waves which broke upon 
them, and also the great and terri-
ble tempests which were caused by 
the fierceness of the wind.

7 And it came to pass that when 
they were buried in the deep there 
was no water that could hurt them, 
their vessels being a tight like unto 
a  dish,  and  also  they  were  tight 
like unto the  b ark of Noah; there-
fore when they were encompassed 
about by many waters they did cry 
unto  the  Lord,  and  he  did  bring 
them forth again upon the top of 
the waters.

8 And it came to pass that the wind 
did  never  cease  to  blow  towards 
the promised land while they were 
upon the waters; and thus they were 
a driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did a sing praises unto 
the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared 
did sing praises unto the Lord, and 
he did b thank and praise the Lord 
all the day long; and when the night 
came, they did not cease to praise 
the Lord.

10 And thus they were driven forth; 
and  no  monster  of  the  sea  could  
break  them,  neither  a whale  that 
could mar them; and they did have 
light  continually,  whether  it  was 
above the water or under the water.
11 And  thus  they  were  driven 
forth, a three hundred and forty and 
four days upon the water.

12 And  they  did  a land  upon  the 
shore of the  b promised land. And 
when they had set their feet upon 
the shores of the promised land they 
bowed themselves down upon the 
face of the land, and did humble 
themselves before the Lord, and did 
shed tears of joy before the Lord, 
because  of  the  multitude  of  his 
c tender mercies over them.

13 And it came to pass that they 
went  forth  upon  the  face  of  the 
land, and began to till the earth.

14 And Jared had four a sons; and 
they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, 
and Mahah, and Orihah.

15 And the brother of Jared also 

begat sons and daughters.

16 And the a friends of Jared and 
his brother were in number about 
twenty  and  two  souls;  and  they 
also begat sons and daughters be-
fore  they  came  to  the  promised 
land; and therefore they began to  
be many.

humbly before the Lord; and they 
were also b taught from on high.

18 And it came to pass that they 
began to spread upon the face of 
the land, and to multiply and to till 
the earth; and they did wax strong 
in the land.

19 And the brother of Jared began  
to be old, and saw that he must soon 
go down to the grave; wherefore he 
said unto Jared: Let us gather together 
our  people  that  we  may  number  
them, that we may know of them 
what they will desire of us before  
we go down to our graves.

20 And  accordingly  the  people 
were  gathered  together.  Now  the 
number of the sons and the daugh-
ters  of  the  brother  of  Jared  were 
twenty and two souls; and the num-
ber of sons and daughters of Jared 
were twelve, he having four sons.

21 And it came to pass that they 
did number their people; and after  
that they had numbered them, they 
did desire of them the things which 
they would that they should do be-
fore they went down to their graves.
22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people  desired  of  them  that  they 
should a anoint one of their sons to 
be a king over them.

23 And now behold, this was griev-
ous unto them. And the brother of 
Jared  said  unto  them:  Surely  this 
thing a leadeth into captivity.

24 But Jared said unto his brother: 
Suffer them that they may have a 
king.  And  therefore  he  said  unto 
them: Choose ye out from among our  
sons a king, even whom ye will.

25 And it came to pass that they 
chose  even  the  firstborn  of  the 
brother of Jared; and his name was  
Pagag. And it came to pass that he  
refused  and  would  not  be  their  
a king. And the people would that 
his  father  should  constrain  him, 
but  his  father  would  not;  and  he 

commanded them that they should 
constrain no man to be their king.
26 And it came to pass that they 
chose all the brothers of Pagag, and 
they would not.

27 And it came to pass that neither 
would the  a sons of Jared, even all 
save it were one; and b Orihah was 
anointed to be king over the people.
28 And he began to reign, and the 
people began to a prosper; and they 
became exceedingly rich.

29 And it came to pass that Jared 

died, and his brother also.

30 And it came to pass that Ori-
hah  did  walk  humbly  before  the 
Lord, and did remember how great 
things  the  Lord  had  done  for  his 
father, and also taught his people 
how great things the Lord had done 
for their fathers.

CHAPTER 7
Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid 
usurpation  and  strife,  the  rival  king-
doms of Shule and Cohor are set up—
Prophets condemn the wickedness and 
idolatry of the people, who then repent.

And it came to pass that Orihah did 
execute judgment upon the land in 
righteousness  all  his  days,  whose 
days were exceedingly many.

2 And he begat sons and daughters; 
yea, he begat thirty and one, among 
whom were twenty and three sons.
3 And it came to pass that he also 
begat  a Kib in his  b old age. And it 
came  to  pass  that  Kib  reigned  in 
his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.

4 And when Corihor was thirty and 
two years old he rebelled against his 
father, and went over and dwelt in 
the land of Nehor; and he begat sons  
and  daughters,  and  they  became 
exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor 
drew away many people after him.

gether an army he came up unto the

land  of  a Moron  where  the  king 
dwelt, and took him captive, which 
b brought to pass the saying of the 
brother  of  Jared  that  they  would 
be brought into captivity.

6 Now the a land of Moron, where 
the king dwelt, was near the land 
which is called Desolation by the 
Nephites.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Kib 
dwelt in a captivity, and his people 
under Corihor his son, until he be-
came exceedingly old; nevertheless 
Kib begat Shule in his old age, while 
he was yet in captivity.

8 And it came to pass that Shule 
was  angry  with  his  brother;  and 
Shule  waxed  strong,  and  became 
mighty as to the strength of a man; 
and he was also mighty in judgment.
9 Wherefore, he came to the hill 
Ephraim, and he did molten out of 
the  hill,  and  made  swords  out  of 
a steel for those whom he had drawn  
away  with  him;  and  after  he  had 
armed them with swords he returned 
to the city Nehor, and gave battle  
unto his brother Corihor, by which 
means  he  obtained  the  kingdom 
and restored it unto his father Kib.
10 And now because of the thing 
which Shule had done, his father 
bestowed upon him the kingdom; 
therefore he began to reign in the 
stead of his father.

11 And it came to pass that he did 
execute judgment in righteousness; 
and he did spread his kingdom upon  
all the face of the land, for the people  
had become exceedingly numerous.
12 And it came to pass that Shule 
also begat many sons and daughters.
13 And  Corihor  repented  of  the 
many  evils  which  he  had  done; 
wherefore  Shule  gave  him  power 
in his kingdom.

14 And it came to pass that Corihor 
had many sons and daughters. And 
among the sons of Corihor there was 
one whose name was Noah.

15 And it came to pass that Noah 

rebelled against Shule, the king, and  
also  his  father  Corihor,  and  drew 
away Cohor his brother, and also all 
his brethren and many of the people.
16 And he gave battle unto Shule, 
the king, in which he did obtain the 
land of their a first inheritance; and 
he became a king over that part of 
the land.

17 And it came to pass that he gave 
battle again unto Shule, the king;  
and he took Shule, the king, and car-
ried him away captive into Moron.
18 And it came to pass as he was 
about to put him to death, the sons 
of  Shule  crept  into  the  house  of 
Noah by night and slew him, and 
broke down the door of the prison 
and brought out their father, and 
placed him upon his throne in his 
own kingdom.

19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did 
build up his kingdom in his stead; 
nevertheless they did not gain power 
any more over Shule the king, and 
the  people  who  were  under  the 
reign of Shule the king did prosper 
exceedingly and wax great.

20 And the country was a divided; 
and there were two kingdoms, the 
kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom 
of Cohor, the son of Noah.

21 And  Cohor,  the  son  of  Noah, 
caused that his people should give 
battle unto Shule, in which Shule 
did beat them and did slay Cohor.
22 And now Cohor had a son who 
was  called  Nimrod;  and  Nimrod 
gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto 
Shule, and he did gain favor in the 
eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did 
bestow great favors upon him, and 
he did do in the kingdom of Shule 
according to his desires.

23 And also in the reign of Shule 
there came a prophets among the peo-
ple,  who  were  sent  from  the  Lord, 
prophesying that the wickedness and 
b idolatry of the people was bringing a 
curse upon the land, and they should 
be destroyed if they did not repent.

24 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did a revile against the prophets, 
and did mock them. And it came 
to pass that king Shule did execute 
judgment against all those who did 
revile against the prophets.

25 And  he  did  execute  a  law 
throughout  all  the  land,  which 
gave power unto the prophets that 
they should go whithersoever they 
would; and by this cause the peo-
ple were brought unto repentance.
26 And because the people did re-
pent of their iniquities and idola-
tries the Lord did spare them, and 
they began to prosper again in the 
land. And it came to pass that Shule 
a begat  sons  and  daughters  in  his  
old age.

27 And there were no more wars 
in the days of Shule; and he remem-
bered the great things that the Lord 
had done for his fathers in bringing 
them a across the great deep into the 
promised  land;  wherefore  he  did 
execute judgment in righteousness 
all his days.

CHAPTER 8
There is strife and contention over the 
kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound 
secret combination to slay the king—Se-
cret combinations are of the devil and 
result in the destruction of nations—
Modern  Gentiles  are  warned  against 
the  secret  combination  that  will  seek 
to overthrow the freedom of all lands, 
nations, and countries.

And it came to pass that he begat 
Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. 
And Omer begat Jared; and Jared  
begat sons and daughters.

2 And Jared rebelled against his 
father, and came and dwelt in the 
land of Heth. And it came to pass 
that he did a flatter many people, be-
cause of his cunning words, until he  
had gained the half of the kingdom.

3 And when he had gained the half 
of the kingdom he gave battle unto 
his father, and he did carry away 
his  father  into  captivity,  and  did 
make him serve in captivity;

4 And  now,  in  the  days  of  the 
reign of Omer he was in a captivity 
the half of his days. And it came to 
pass that he begat sons and daugh-
ters, among whom were Esrom and  
Coriantumr;

5 And they were exceedingly an-
gry because of the doings of Jared 
their brother, insomuch that they 
did raise an army and gave battle 
unto  Jared.  And  it  came  to  pass 
that they did give battle unto him  
by night.

6 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  slain  the  army  of  Jared 
they were about to slay him also; 
and  he  pled  with  them  that  they 
would not slay him, and he would 
give up the kingdom unto his father. 
And it came to pass that they did 
grant unto him his life.

7 And now Jared became exceed-
ingly a sorrowful because of the loss 
of the kingdom, for he had set his 
heart upon the kingdom and upon 
the glory of the world.

8 Now the daughter of Jared being 
exceedingly expert, and seeing the 
sorrows  of  her  father,  thought  to 
devise a plan whereby she could re-
deem the kingdom unto her father.
9 Now the daughter of Jared was 
exceedingly fair. And it came to pass 
that  she  did  talk  with  her  father, 
and said unto him: Whereby hath 
my  father  so  much  sorrow?  Hath 
he not read the a record which our 
fathers  brought  across  the  great 
deep? Behold, is there not an  b ac-
count concerning them of c old, that  
they  by  their  d secret  plans  did  
obtain kingdoms and great glory  ?

father  send  for  Akish,  the  son  of

Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and 
I will dance before him, and I will 
please him, that he will desire me 
to wife; wherefore if he shall desire 
of thee that ye shall give unto him 
me to wife, then shall ye say: I will 
give her if ye will bring unto me 
the a head of my father, the king.

11 And  now  Omer  was  a  friend 
to  Akish;  wherefore,  when  Jared 
had  sent  for  Akish,  the  daughter 
of  Jared  danced  before  him  that 
she pleased him, insomuch that he 
desired her to wife. And it came to 
pass that he said unto Jared: Give 
her unto me to wife.

12 And Jared said unto him: I will 
give her unto you, if ye will bring 
unto me the head of my father, the  
king.

13 And it came to pass that Akish  
gathered in unto the house of Jared 
all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: 
Will ye swear unto me that ye will 
be  faithful  unto  me  in  the  thing 
which I shall desire of you?

14 And it came to pass that they 
all a sware unto him, by the God of 
heaven,  and  also  by  the  heavens, 
and also by the earth, and by their 
heads, that whoso should vary from 
the assistance which Akish desired 
should  lose  his  head;  and  whoso 
should  divulge  whatsoever  thing 
Akish made known unto them, the 
same should lose his life.

15 And it came to pass that thus 
they  did  agree  with  a Akish.  And  
Akish did administer unto them the 
oaths which were given by them of 
old who also sought power, which 
had been handed down even from 
b Cain,  who  was  a  murderer  from 
the beginning.

16 And they were kept up by the 
a power of the devil to administer 
these oaths unto the people, to keep 
them in darkness, to help such as 

sought power to gain power, and to 
murder, and to plunder, and to lie, 
and to commit all manner of wick-
edness and whoredoms.

17 And  it  was  the  daughter  of 
Jared who put it into his heart to 
search up these things of old; and 
Jared put it into the heart of Akish; 
wherefore,  Akish  administered  it 
unto his kindred and friends, lead-
ing them away by fair promises to 
do whatsoever thing he desired.

18 And it came to pass that they 
formed a a secret combination, even 
as they of old; which combination is 
most abominable and wicked above 
all, in the sight of God;

19 For the Lord worketh not in se-
cret combinations, neither doth he 
will  that  man  should  shed  blood, 
but in all things hath forbidden it, 
from the beginning of man.

20 And now I, Moroni, do not write 
the manner of their oaths and com-
binations,  for  it  hath  been  made 
known unto me that they are had  
a among  all  people,  and  they  are  
had among the Lamanites.

21 And they have caused the a de-
struction of this people of whom I 
am now speaking, and also the de-
struction of the people of Nephi.

22 And whatsoever  a nation shall 
uphold such secret combinations, 
to get power and gain, until they 
shall spread over the nation, behold, 
they shall be destroyed; for the Lord 
will not suffer that the b blood of his 
saints, which shall be shed by them, 
shall always cry unto him from the 
ground for c vengeance upon them 
and yet he avenge them not.

23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is 
wisdom  in  God  that  these  things 
should  be  shown  unto  you,  that 
thereby ye may repent of your sins, 
and suffer not that these murderous 
combinations shall get above you,

which are built up to get a power and

work of b destruction come upon you, 
yea, even the sword of the justice of  
the Eternal God shall fall upon you, 
to your overthrow and destruction 
if ye shall suffer these things to be.
24 Wherefore, the Lord command-
eth  you,  when  ye  shall  see  these 
things  come  among  you  that  ye 
shall awake to a sense of your aw-
ful situation, because of this a secret 
combination which shall be among 
you;  or  wo  be  unto  it,  because  of 
the blood of them who have been 
slain; for they cry from the dust for 
vengeance upon it, and also upon 
those who built it up.

25 For it cometh to pass that whoso 
buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow 
the a freedom of all lands, nations, 
and  countries;  and  it  bringeth  to 
pass the destruction of all people, 
for it is built up by the devil, who is  
the father of all lies; even that same 
liar who b beguiled our first parents, 
yea, even that same liar who hath 
caused man to commit murder from 
the beginning; who hath c hardened  
the  hearts  of  men  that  they  have 
d murdered the prophets, and stoned 
them, and cast them out from the 
beginning.

26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am com-
manded to write these things that 
evil  may  be  done  away,  and  that 
the time may come that Satan may 
have a no power upon the hearts of 
the children of men, but that they 
may be b persuaded to do good con-
tinually, that they may come unto 
the  fountain  of  all  c righteousness 
and be saved.

CHAPTER 9
The kingdom passes from one to another 
by  descent,  intrigue,  and  murder—

Emer saw the Son of Righteousness—
Many  prophets  cry  repentance —A 
famine and poisonous serpents plague  
the people.

And  now  I,  Moroni,  proceed  with 
my  record.  Therefore,  behold,  it 
came  to  pass  that  because  of  the 
a secret combinations of Akish and 
his friends, behold, they did over-
throw the kingdom of Omer.

2 Nevertheless, the Lord was mer-
ciful unto Omer, and also to his sons 
and to his daughters who did not 
seek his destruction.

3 And  the  Lord  a warned  Omer 
in a dream that he should depart 
out  of  the  land;  wherefore  Omer 
b departed out of the land with his 
family, and traveled many days, and 
came over and passed by the hill of 
c Shim, and came over by the place 
d where the Nephites were destroyed, 
and  from  thence  eastward,  and 
came to a place which was called 
Ablom, by the seashore, and there 
he  pitched  his  tent,  and  also  his 
sons and his daughters, and all his 
household, save it were Jared and  
his family.

4 And it came to pass that Jared 
was anointed king over the people, 
by the hand of wickedness; and he  
gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.
5 And it came to pass that Akish 
a sought the life of his father-in-law; 
and  he  applied  unto  those  whom 
he had sworn by the  b oath of the 
ancients,  and  they  obtained  the 
head of his father-in-law, as he sat 
upon  his  throne,  giving  audience 
to his people.

6 For so great had been the spread-
ing of this wicked and secret society 
that it had corrupted the hearts of 
all the people; therefore Jared was 
murdered  upon  his  throne,  and 
Akish reigned in his stead.

7 And it came to pass that Akish 
began  to  be  a jealous  of  his  son, 
therefore he shut him up in prison, 
and kept him upon little or no food 
until he had suffered death.

8 And now the brother of him that 
suffered death, (and his name was 
Nimrah) was angry with his father 
because  of  that  which  his  father 
had done unto his brother.

9 And it came to pass that Nimrah 
gathered together a small number of 
men, and fled out of the land, and 
came over and dwelt with Omer.

10 And it came to pass that Akish 
begat other sons, and they won the 
hearts of the people, notwithstand-
ing they had sworn unto him to do 
all manner of iniquity according to 
that which he desired.

11 Now the people of Akish were 
desirous for gain, even as Akish was 
desirous for a power; wherefore, the 
sons of Akish did offer them b money,  
by which means they drew away the 
more part of the people after them.
12 And  there  began  to  be  a  war 
between  the  sons  of  Akish  and  
Akish, which lasted for the space 
of  many  years,  yea,  unto  the  de-
struction of nearly all the people 
of the kingdom, yea, even all, save 
it were thirty souls, and they who 
fled with the house of Omer.

13 Wherefore, Omer was restored 
again to the a land of his inheritance.
14 And it came to pass that Omer 
began  to  be  old;  nevertheless,  in 
his old age he begat Emer; and he 
anointed Emer to be king to reign 
in his stead.

15 And after that he had anointed 
Emer  to  be  king  he  saw  peace  in 
the land for the space of two years, 
and  he  died,  having  seen  exceed-
ingly many days, which were full 
of sorrow. And it came to pass that 
Emer did reign in his stead, and did 
fill the steps of his father.

16 And  the  Lord  began  again  to 
take the curse from off the land, and 
the house of Emer did prosper ex-
ceedingly under the reign of Emer; 
and in the space of sixty and two 
years they had become exceedingly 
strong, insomuch that they became 
exceedingly rich—

17 Having  a all  manner  of  fruit, 
and of grain, and of b silks, and of 
fine linen, and of c gold, and of sil-
ver, and of precious things;

18 And also a all manner of cattle, 
of  oxen,  and  cows,  and  of  sheep, 
and of swine, and of goats, and also 
many other kinds of animals which 
were useful for the food of man.

19 And they also had a horses, and 
asses,  and  there  were  elephants 
and cureloms and cumoms; all of 
which were useful unto man, and 
more especially the elephants and 
cureloms and cumoms.

20 And thus the Lord did pour out 
his blessings upon this land, which 
was a choice above all other lands; 
and  he  commanded  that  whoso 
should  possess  the  land  should 
possess  it  unto  the  Lord,  or  they 
should  be  b destroyed  when  they 
were ripened in iniquity; for upon 
such, saith the Lord: I will pour out 
the fulness of my wrath.

21 And  Emer  did  execute  judg-
ment in righteousness all his days, 
and he begat many sons and daugh-
ters; and he begat Coriantum, and 
he anointed Coriantum to reign in  
his stead.

22 And  after  he  had  anointed  
Coriantum to reign in his stead he 
lived four years, and he saw peace 
in the land; yea, and he even saw 
the a Son of Righteousness, and did 
rejoice and glory in his day; and he 
died in peace.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tum  did  walk  in  the  steps  of  his 
father, and did build many mighty

cities, and did administer that which 
was good unto his people in all his 
days. And it came to pass that he 
had no children even until he was 
exceedingly a old.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
wife  died,  being  an  hundred  and 
two years old. And it came to pass 
that Coriantum took to wife, in his 
old age, a young maid, and begat 
sons and daughters; wherefore he 
lived until he was an hundred and 
forty and two years old.

25 And it came to pass that he be-
gat Com, and Com reigned in his 
stead; and he reigned forty and nine 
years,  and  he  begat  Heth;  and  he 
also begat other sons and daughters.
26 And  the  people  had  spread 
again over all the face of the land, 
and there began again to be an ex-
ceedingly  great  wickedness  upon 
the  face  of  the  land,  and  a Heth 
began to embrace the secret plans 
again of old, to destroy his father.
27 And it came to pass that he did 
dethrone his father, for he slew him 
with  his  own  sword;  and  he  did 
reign in his stead.

28 And  there  came  prophets  in 
the land a again, crying repentance 
unto  them—that  they  must  pre-
pare the way of the Lord or there 
should come a curse upon the face 
of the land; yea, even there should 
be  a  great  famine,  in  which  they 
should be destroyed if they did not  
repent.

29 But the people believed not the 
words of the prophets, but they cast 
them out; and some of them they 
cast into a pits and left them to per-
ish. And it came to pass that they 
did all these things according to the 
commandment of the king, Heth.

30 And it came to pass that there 
began to be a great a dearth upon the 
land, and the inhabitants began to be 
destroyed exceedingly fast because  

of the dearth, for there was no rain 
upon the face of the earth.

31 And there came forth a poison-
ous serpents also upon the face of 
the land, and did poison many peo-
ple. And it came to pass that their 
flocks began to flee before the poi-
sonous serpents, towards the land 
b southward,  which  was  called  by 
the Nephites c Zarahemla.

32 And it came to pass that there 
were many of them which did per-
ish by the way; nevertheless, there 
were some which fled into the land 
southward.

33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  did  cause  the  a serpents  that 
they should pursue them no more, 
but that they should hedge up the 
way that the people could not pass, 
that whoso should attempt to pass 
might fall by the poisonous serpents.
34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people did follow the course of the 
beasts, and did devour the a carcasses  
of them which fell by the way, until 
they had devoured them all. Now 
when the people saw that they must 
b perish they began to c repent of their 
iniquities and cry unto the Lord.

35 And it came to pass that when 
they had a humbled themselves suffi-
ciently before the Lord he did send 
rain upon the face of the earth; and 
the people began to revive again, 
and there began to be fruit in the 
north countries, and in all the coun-
tries round about. And the Lord did 
show forth his power unto them in 
preserving them from famine.

a Heth had perished by the famine, 
and all his household save it were 
Shez—wherefore,  Shez  began  to 
build up again a broken people.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Shez 
did  remember  the  destruction  of 
his fathers, and he did build up a 
righteous kingdom; for he remem-
bered what the Lord had done in 
bringing  Jared  and  his  brother 
a across the deep; and he did walk 
in the ways of the Lord; and he be-
gat sons and daughters.

3 And his eldest son, whose name 
was  Shez,  did  a rebel  against  him; 
nevertheless, Shez was smitten by 
the hand of a robber, because of his 
exceeding  riches,  which  brought 
peace again unto his father.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
father  did  build  up  many  cities 
upon the face of the land, and the 
people began again to spread over 
all the face of the land. And Shez 
did live to an exceedingly old age; 
and he begat Riplakish. And he died, 
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.
5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Rip-
lakish  did  not  do  that  which  was 
right in the sight of the Lord, for he 
did have many wives and  a concu-
bines, and did lay that upon men’s 
shoulders which was grievous to be 
borne; yea, he did b tax them with 
heavy taxes; and with the taxes he 
did build many spacious buildings.
6 And he did erect him an exceed-
ingly beautiful throne; and he did 
build  many  prisons,  and  whoso 
would not be subject unto taxes he 
did a cast into prison; and whoso was 
not  able  to  pay  taxes  he  did  cast 
into prison; and he did cause that 
they should labor continually for 
their  support;  and  whoso  refused 
to  labor  he  did  cause  to  be  put  
to death.

7 Wherefore he did obtain all his 
fine work, yea, even his fine a gold 
he did cause to be refined in prison; 

and all manner of fine b workman-
ship  he  did  cause  to  be  wrought 
in prison. And it came to pass that 
he did afflict the people with his 
whoredoms and abominations.

8 And when he had reigned for the  
space of forty and two years the peo-
ple did rise up in rebellion against  
him;  and  there  began  to  be  war 
again  in  the  land,  insomuch  that 
Ripla kish was killed, and his descen-
dants were driven out of the land.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  after  the 
space of many years, Morianton, (he 
being  a  descendant  of  Riplakish) 
gathered together an army of out-
casts, and went forth and gave bat-
tle unto the people; and he gained 
power over many cities; and the war 
became exceedingly sore, and did 
last  for  the  space  of  many  years; 
and he did gain power over all the 
land, and did establish himself king  
over all the land.

10 And  after  that  he  had  estab-
lished himself king he did ease the 
burden of the people, by which he 
did  gain  favor  in  the  eyes  of  the 
people,  and  they  did  anoint  him 
to be their king.

11 And  he  did  do  justice  unto 
the  people,  but  not  unto  himself 
because of his many a whoredoms; 
wherefore he was cut off from the 
presence of the Lord.

12 And it came to pass that Mori-
anton built up many cities, and the 
people  became  exceedingly  rich 
under his reign, both in buildings, 
and in a gold and silver, and in rais-
ing grain, and in flocks, and herds, 
and  such  things  which  had  been 
restored unto them.

13 And Morianton did live to an 
exceedingly great age, and then he 
begat  Kim;  and  Kim  did  reign  in 
the stead of his father; and he did 
reign  eight  years,  and  his  father 
died. And it came to pass that Kim 
did  a not  reign  in  righteousness,

wherefore  he  was  not  favored  of 
the Lord.

14 And his brother did rise up in 
rebellion against him, by which he 
did bring him into a captivity; and 
he did remain in captivity all his 
days; and he begat sons and daugh-
ters in captivity, and in his old age 
he begat Levi; and he died.

15 And it came to pass that Levi 
did  serve  in  captivity  after  the 
death  of  his  father,  for  the  space 
of forty and two years. And he did 
make war against the king of the 
land, by which he did obtain unto 
himself the kingdom.

16 And  after  he  had  obtained 
unto himself the kingdom he did 
that  which  was  right  in  the  sight 
of  the  Lord;  and  the  people  did 
prosper in the land; and he did live 
to a good a old age, and begat sons 
and  daughters;  and  he  also  begat 
Corom, whom he anointed king in  
his stead.

17 And it came to pass that Corom 
did that which was good in the sight 
of the Lord all his days; and he be-
gat many sons and daughters; and 
after he had seen many days he did 
pass away, even like unto the rest 
of  the  earth;  and  Kish  reigned  in  
his stead.

18 And it came to pass that Kish 
passed away also, and Lib reigned 
in his stead.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lib 
also did that which was good in the 
sight of the Lord. And in the days 
of Lib the a poisonous serpents were 
destroyed. Wherefore they did go 
into  the  land  southward,  to  hunt 
food for the people of the land, for 
the land was covered with animals 
of the forest. And Lib also himself 
became a great b hunter.

20 And they built a great city by 

the  a narrow  neck  of  land,  by  the 
place where the sea divides the land.
21 And they did preserve the land 
a southward for a wilderness, to get 
game.  And  the  whole  face  of  the 
land northward was covered with 
inhabitants.

22 And  they  were  exceedingly 
a industrious, and they did buy and 
sell and b traffic one with another, 
that they might get gain.

23 And they did a work in all man-
ner of b ore, and they did make gold, 
and  silver,  and  c iron,  and  d brass, 
and all manner of metals; and they 
did dig it out of the earth; where-
fore, they did cast up mighty heaps 
of earth to get ore, of gold, and of 
silver, and of iron, and of copper. 
And they did e work all manner of  
fine work.

24 And they did have  a silks, and 
fine-twined  b linen;  and  they  did 
work all manner of c cloth, that they 
might clothe themselves from their 
nakedness.

25 And  they  did  make  all  man-
ner of tools to till the earth, both 
to plow and to sow, to reap and to 
hoe, and also to thrash.

26 And they did make all manner 
of tools with which they did work 
their beasts.

27 And they did make all manner 
of a weapons of war. And they did 
work all manner of work of exceed-
ingly curious workmanship.

28 And  never  could  be  a  people 
more blessed than were they, and 
more prospered by the hand of the 
Lord. And they were in a land that 
was choice above all lands, for the 
Lord had spoken it.

29 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lib 
did live many years, and begat sons 
and  daughters;  and  he  also  begat 
Hearthom.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that 
Hearthom reigned in the stead of 
his father. And when Hearthom had 
reigned twenty and four years, be-
hold, the kingdom was taken away 
from  him.  And  he  served  many 
years in a captivity, yea, even all the 
remainder of his days.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
prophets  were  a rejected  by  the 
people, and they fled unto Com for 
protection, for the people sought to 
destroy them.

3 And they prophesied unto Com 
many things; and he was blessed in 
all the remainder of his days.

31 And he begat Heth, and Heth 
lived in captivity all his days. And 
Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt 
in captivity all his days; and he be-
gat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah 
also dwelt in captivity all his days; 
and he begat Coriantum, and Cori-
antum  dwelt  in  captivity  all  his 
days; and he begat Com.

32 And it came to pass that Com 
drew away the half of the kingdom. 
And  he  reigned  over  the  half  of 
the kingdom forty and two years; 
and he went to battle against the 
king,  Amgid,  and  they  fought  for 
the  space  of  many  years,  during 
which time Com gained power over 
Amgid, and obtained power over the 
remainder of the kingdom.

33 And in the days of Com there 
began to be robbers in the land; and 
they adopted the old plans, and ad-
ministered a oaths after the manner 
of the ancients, and sought again 
to destroy the kingdom.

34 Now  Com  did  fight  against 
them  much;  nevertheless,  he  did 
not prevail against them.

CHAPTER 11

Wars,  dissensions,  and  wickedness 
dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict 
the  utter  destruction  of  the  Jaredites 
unless  they  repent—The  people  reject 
the words of the prophets.
And there came also in the days of 
Com many a prophets, and prophe-
sied of the destruction of that great 
people except they should repent, 
and turn unto the Lord, and forsake 
their murders and wickedness.

4 And he lived to a good old age, 
and  begat  Shiblom;  and  Shiblom 
reigned in his stead. And the brother 
of  Shiblom  rebelled  against  him, 
and there began to be an exceed-
ingly great war in all the land.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Shiblom caused that all 
the prophets who prophesied of the 
destruction of the people should be 
put to a death;

6 And there was great calamity in 
all the land, for they had testified 
that a great curse should come upon 
the land, and also upon the people, 
and that there should be a great de-
struction among them, such an one 
as never had been upon the face of 
the earth, and their bones should 
become as a heaps of earth upon the 
face of the land except they should 
repent of their wickedness.

7 And they hearkened not unto the 
voice of the Lord, because of their 
wicked  combinations;  wherefore,  
there began to be wars and a conten-
tions in all the land, and also many  
famines and pestilences, insomuch 
that there was a great destruction, 
such  an  one  as  never  had  been 
known upon the face of the earth; 
and all this came to pass in the days 
of Shiblom.

8 And the people began to repent 
of their iniquity; and inasmuch as 
they did the Lord did have a mercy 
on them.

9 And it came to pass that Shiblom 
was  slain,  and  Seth  was  brought 
into  a captivity,  and  did  dwell  in 
captivity all his days.

his son, did obtain the kingdom; and 
he did reign over the people all his 
days. And he did do all manner of 
iniquity in his days, by which he 
did  cause  the  shedding  of  much 
blood; and few were his days.

11 And Ethem, being a descendant 
of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom; 
and he also did do that which was 
wicked in his days.

12 And it came to pass that in the 
days  of  Ethem  there  came  many 
prophets,  and  prophesied  again 
unto the people; yea, they did proph-
esy  that  the  Lord  would  utterly 
a destroy them from off the face of 
the earth except they repented of 
their iniquities.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people hardened their hearts, and 
would not  a hearken unto their words;  
and  the  prophets  b mourned  and 
withdrew from among the people.
14 And it came to pass that Ethem 
did execute judgment in wicked-
ness all his days; and he begat Mo-
ron. And it came to pass that Moron  
did reign in his stead; and Moron did 
that which was wicked before the  
Lord.

15 And it came to pass that there 
arose a a rebellion among the people, 
because of that secret b combination 
which was built up to get power and 
gain; and there arose a mighty man 
among them in iniquity, and gave 
battle unto Moron, in which he did 
overthrow the half of the kingdom; 
and he did maintain the half of the 
kingdom for many years.

16 And it came to pass that Moron 
did overthrow him, and did obtain 
the kingdom again.

17 And it came to pass that there 
arose another mighty man; and he 
was  a  descendant  of  the  brother 
of Jared.

18 And it came to pass that he did 
overthrow  Moron  and  obtain  the 
kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt 
in  a captivity all the remainder of 
his days; and he begat Coriantor.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  
Coriantor  dwelt  in  captivity  all 
his days.

20 And  in  the  days  of  Coriantor 
there  also  came  many  prophets, 
and prophesied of great and mar-
velous things, and cried repentance 
unto  the  people,  and  except  they 
should repent the Lord God would 
execute a judgment against them to 
their utter destruction;

21 And that the Lord God would 
send or bring forth  a another peo-
ple  to  possess  the  b land,  by  his 
power, after the manner by which 
he brought their fathers.

22 And  they  did  a reject  all  the 
words of the prophets, because of 
their  b secret  society  and  wicked 
abominations.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tor begat a Ether, and he died, hav-
ing dwelt in captivity all his days.

of Ether were in the days of a Cori-

over all the land.

in the days of Coriantumr, and be-
gan to prophesy unto the people, 
for  he  could  not  be  b restrained 
because  of  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord 
which was in him.

3 For he did a cry from the b morn-
ing, even until the going down of 
the  sun,  exhorting  the  people  to 
believe in God unto repentance lest 
they should be  c destroyed, saying 
unto them that d by e faith all things 
are fulfilled—

4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in 
God might with  a surety  b hope for 
a better world, yea, even a place at 
the right hand of God, which c hope 
cometh of d faith, maketh an e anchor 
to the souls of men, which would 
make them sure and steadfast, al-
ways  abounding  in  f good  works, 
being led to g glorify God.

5 And it came to pass that Ether 
did prophesy great and marvelous 
things unto the people, which they 
did not believe, because they a saw 
them not.

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak 
somewhat concerning these things; 
I would show unto the world that 
a faith  is  things  which  are  b hoped 
for  and  c not  seen;  wherefore,  dis-
pute not because ye see not, for ye 
receive no d witness until after the 
e trial of your faith.

7 For  it  was  by  faith  that  Christ 
showed  himself  unto  our  fathers, 
after he had risen from the dead; 
and  he  showed  not  himself  unto 
them  until  after  they  had  faith 
in  him;  wherefore,  it  must  needs 

be  that  some  had  faith  in  him, 
for  he  showed  himself  a not  unto  
the world.

8 But because of the faith of men 
he  has  shown  himself  unto  the 
world,  and  glorified  the  name  of 
the Father, and prepared a way that 
thereby others might be partakers 
of the heavenly gift, that they might 
hope for those things which they 
have not seen.

9 Wherefore,  ye  may  also  have 
hope, and be partakers of the gift, 
if ye will but have faith.

10 Behold it was by faith that they 
of old were  a called after the holy 
order of God.

11 Wherefore, by faith was the law 
of Moses given. But in the a gift of 
his Son hath God prepared a more 
b excellent  way;  and  it  is  by  faith 
that it hath been fulfilled.

12 For if there be no a faith among 
the children of men God can do no 
b miracle  among  them;  wherefore, 
he showed not himself until after 
their faith.

13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma 
and Amulek that caused the a prison 
to tumble to the earth.

14 Behold,  it  was  the  faith  of 
Nephi and Lehi that wrought the 
a change upon the Lamanites, that 
they  were  baptized  with  fire  and 
with the b Holy Ghost.

15 Behold,  it  was  the  faith  of 
a Ammon  and  his  brethren  which 
b wrought so great a miracle among 
the Lamanites.

even a before Christ came, who could 
not be kept from within the b veil, 
but truly saw with their eyes the 
things which they had beheld with 
an eye of faith, and they were glad.
20 And  behold,  we  have  seen  in 
this record that one of these was the 
brother of Jared; for so great was 
his faith in God, that when God put 
forth his a finger he could not hide 
it from the sight of the brother of 
Jared, because of his word which he 
had spoken unto him, which word 
he had obtained by faith.

21 And after the brother of Jared 
had beheld the finger of the Lord, 
because of the a promise which the 
brother of Jared had obtained by 
faith, the Lord could not withhold 
anything from his sight; wherefore 
he showed him all things, for he could  
no longer be kept without the b veil.
22 And it is by faith that my fathers  
have  obtained  the  a promise  that 
these  things  should  come  unto 
their brethren through the Gentiles; 
therefore the Lord hath commanded 
me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

23 And I said unto him: Lord, the 
Gentiles will a mock at these things, 
because of our b weakness in writing; 
for Lord thou hast made us c mighty 
in word by faith, but thou hast not 
made us mighty in writing; for thou 
hast made all this people that they 
could speak much, because of the 
Holy Ghost which thou hast given 
them;

24 And thou hast made us that we 
could  write  but  little,  because  of 
the a awkwardness of our hands. Be-
hold, thou hast not made us mighty 
in  b writing  like  unto  the  brother 
of Jared, for thou madest him that 
the  things  which  he  c wrote  were 
mighty even as thou art, unto the 
overpowering of man to read them.
25 Thou hast also made our words 
powerful  and  great,  even  that  we 
a cannot write them; wherefore, when  
we write we behold our b weakness, 
and  stumble  because  of  the  plac-
ing of our words; and I fear lest the 
Gentiles shall c mock at our words.
26 And when I had said this, the 
Lord spake unto me, saying: a Fools 
b mock, but they shall mourn; and 
my grace is sufficient for the meek, 
that they shall take no advantage 
of your weakness;

27 And  if  men  come  unto  me  I 
will show unto them their  a weak-
ness.  I  b give  unto  men  weakness 
that they may be humble; and my 
c grace is sufficient for all men that 
d humble themselves before me; for 
if they humble themselves before 
me, and have faith in me, then will 
I make e weak things become strong 
unto them.

ETHER 12  : 28–41

28 Behold,  I  will  show  unto  the 
Gentiles their weakness, and I will 
show  unto  them  that  a faith,  hope 
and charity bringeth unto me—the 
fountain of all b righteousness.

29 And  I,  Moroni,  having  heard 
these  words,  was  a comforted,  and 
said: O Lord, thy righteous will be 
done, for I know that thou workest 
unto the children of men according 
to their faith;

30 For  the  brother  of  Jared  said 
unto  the  mountain  Zerin,  a Re-
move—and it was removed. And if 
he had not had faith it would not 
have moved; wherefore thou work-
est after men have faith.

31 For  thus  didst  thou  manifest 
thyself unto thy disciples; for a after 
they had  b faith, and did speak in 
thy name, thou didst show thyself 
unto them in great power.

32 And I also remember that thou 
hast said that thou hast prepared a 
house for man, yea, even among the 
a mansions of thy Father, in which 
man might have a more excellent 
b hope; wherefore man must hope, 
or  he  cannot  receive  an  inheri-
tance in the place which thou hast  
prepared.

33 And  again,  I  remember  that 
thou hast said that thou hast a loved 
the  world,  even  unto  the  laying 
down of thy life for the world, that 
thou mightest take it again to pre-
pare a place for the children of men.
34 And now I know that this a love 
which thou hast had for the chil-
dren of men is charity; wherefore, 
except men shall have charity they 
cannot inherit that place which thou 

hast prepared in the mansions of 
thy Father.

35 Wherefore, I know by this thing 
which  thou  hast  said,  that  if  the 
Gentiles have not a charity, because 
of  our  weakness,  that  thou  wilt 
prove them, and  b take away their 
c talent, yea, even that which they 
have received, and give unto them 
who shall have more abundantly.

36 And it came to pass that I prayed 
unto the Lord that he would give unto  
the Gentiles a grace, that they might 
have charity.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord said unto me: If they have not 
charity it mattereth not unto thee, 
thou hast been faithful; wherefore,  
thy garments shall be made a clean. 
And  because  thou  hast  seen  thy 
b weakness thou shalt be made strong,  
even unto the sitting down in the 
place  which  I  have  prepared  in  
the mansions of my Father.

38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell 
unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto 
my brethren whom I love, until we 
shall  meet  before  the  a judgment-
seat of Christ, where all men shall 
know  that  my  b garments  are  not 
spotted with your blood.

39 And then shall ye know that I 
have a seen Jesus, and that he hath 
talked with me  b face to face, and 
that he told me in c plain humility, 
even  as  a  man  telleth  another  in 
mine  own  language,  concerning 
these things;

40 And only a few have I written, 
because of my weakness in writing.
41 And  now,  I  would  commend 
you to a seek this Jesus of whom the

CHAPTER 13
Ether  speaks  of  a  New  Jerusalem  to 
be built in America by the seed of Jo-
seph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes 
the  Jaredite  history,  and  foretells  the 
destruction of the Jaredites—War rages 
over all the land.

And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish  
my record concerning the destruc-
tion of the people of whom I have 
been writing.

2 For behold, they rejected all the  
words of Ether; for he truly told them 
of all things, from the beginning of  
man; and that after the waters had 
a receded from off the face of this 
b land it became a choice land above 
all other lands, a chosen land of the 
Lord;  wherefore  the  Lord  would 
have that all men should c serve him 
who dwell upon the face thereof;

3 And  that  it  was  the  place  of  
the a New Jerusalem, which should  
b come down out of heaven, and the 
holy sanctuary of the Lord.

4 Behold,  Ether  saw  the  days  of 
Christ,  and  he  spake  concerning 
a a New Jerusalem upon this land.

5 And he spake also concerning the 
house of Israel, and the a Jerusalem  
from whence b Lehi should come—af-
ter it should be destroyed it should 
be built up again, a c holy city unto 
the Lord; wherefore, it could not be 
a new Jerusalem for it had been in 

a time of old; but it should be built 
up again, and become a holy city of  
the Lord; and it should be built unto  
the house of Israel—

6 And that a a New Jerusalem should 
be built up upon this land, unto the 
remnant of the seed of b Joseph, for  
which things there has been a c type.
7 For as Joseph brought his father 
down into the land of a Egypt, even 
so  he  died  there;  wherefore,  the 
Lord brought a remnant of the seed 
of Joseph out of the land of Jeru-
salem,  that  he  might  be  merciful 
unto the seed of Joseph that they 
should b perish not, even as he was 
merciful unto the father of Joseph 
that he should perish not.

8 Wherefore, the remnant of the 
house of Joseph shall be built upon 
this a land; and it shall be a land of 
their  inheritance;  and  they  shall 
build up a holy b city unto the Lord, 
like unto the Jerusalem of old; and 
they shall c no more be confounded, 
until the end come when the earth 
shall pass away.

9 And there shall be a a new heaven 
and a new earth; and they shall be 
like unto the old save the old have 
passed  away,  and  all  things  have 
become new.

10 And then cometh the New Je-
rusalem; and blessed are they who 
dwell therein, for it is they whose 
garments  are  a white  through  the 
blood  of  the  Lamb;  and  they  are 
they who are numbered among the 
remnant of the seed of Joseph, who 
were of the house of Israel.

11 And  then  also  cometh  the  
a Jerusalem of old; and the inhabi-
tants thereof, blessed are they, for

ETHER 13  : 12–25

 they have been washed in the blood 
of the Lamb; and they are they who 
were scattered and gathered in from 
the four quarters of the earth, and 
from the b north countries, and are 
partakers  of  the  fulfilling  of  the 
covenant  which  God  made  with 
their father, c Abraham.

12 And when these things come, 
bringeth to pass the scripture which 
saith, there are they who were a first, 
who shall be last; and there are they 
who were last, who shall be first.

13 And I was about to write more, 
but I am forbidden; but great and 
marvelous were the prophecies of 
Ether;  but  they  esteemed  him  as 
naught, and cast him out; and he 
a hid himself in the cavity of a rock 
by day, and by night he went forth 
viewing  the  things  which  should 
come upon the people.

14 And as he dwelt in the cavity 
of a rock he made the a remainder 
of this record, viewing the destruc-
tions which came upon the people, 
by night.

15 And it came to pass that in that 
same year in which he was cast out 
from among the people there began 
to be a great war among the people, 
for there were many who rose up, 
who were mighty men, and sought 
to destroy Coriantumr by their se-
cret plans of wickedness, of which 
hath been spoken.

16 And  now  Coriantumr,  having 
studied,  himself,  in  all  the  arts 
of war and all the cunning of the 
world, wherefore he gave battle unto 
them who sought to destroy him.

17 But he repented not, neither his 
a fair sons nor daughters; neither the 
fair sons and daughters of Cohor; 
neither the fair sons and daughters 
of Corihor; and in fine, there were 
none of the fair sons and daughters 

upon  the  face  of  the  whole  earth 
who repented of their sins.

18 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
in  the  first  year  that  Ether  dwelt 
in the cavity of a rock, there were 
many people who were slain by the 
sword of those a secret combinations, 
fighting  against  Coriantumr  that 
they might obtain the kingdom.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
sons  of  Coriantumr  fought  much 
and bled much.

20 And in the second year the word 
of the Lord came to Ether, that he 
should go and a prophesy unto b Cori-
antumr  that,  if  he  would  repent, 
and  all  his  household,  the  Lord 
would give unto him his kingdom 
and spare the people—

21 Other wise  they  should  be 
destroyed,  and  all  his  household  
save it were himself. And he should 
only live to see the fulfilling of the 
prophecies which had been spoken 
concerning a another people receiv-
ing the land for their inheritance; 
and  Coriantumr  should  receive 
a  burial  by  them;  and  every  soul 
should  be  destroyed  save  it  were 
b Coriantumr.

22 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr  repented  not,  neither  his 
household, neither the people; and  
the wars ceased not; and they sought 
to  a kill  Ether,  but  he  fled  from  
before them and hid again in the 
cavity of the rock.

23 And it came to pass that there 
arose up Shared, and he also gave 
battle unto Coriantumr; and he did 
beat him, insomuch that in the third 
year he did bring him into captivity.
24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in 
the  fourth  year,  did  beat  Shared, 
and did obtain the kingdom again 
unto their father.

25 Now  there  began  to  be  a  war

upon all the face of the land, a every  
man with his band fighting for that 
which he desired.

26 And  there  were  robbers,  and 
in fine, all manner of wickedness 
upon all the face of the land.

27 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr was exceedingly angry with 
Shared,  and  he  went  against  him 
with his armies to battle; and they 
did meet in great anger, and they 
did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and 
the battle became exceedingly sore.
28 And it came to pass that Shared 
fought  against  him  for  the  space 
of three days. And it came to pass 
that Coriantumr beat him, and did 
pursue  him  until  he  came  to  the 
plains of Heshlon.

29 And it came to pass that Shared 
gave  him  battle  again  upon  the 
plains;  and  behold,  he  did  beat 
Coriantumr,  and  drove  him  back 
again to the valley of Gilgal.

30 And  Coriantumr  gave  Shared 
battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in  
which he beat Shared and slew him.
31 And Shared wounded Corian-
tumr in his thigh, that he did not 
go to battle again for the space of 
two  years,  in  which  time  all  the 
people  upon  the  face  of  the  land 
were  shedding  blood,  and  there 
was none to restrain them.

unto that which was his own, with 
his  hands,  and  would  not  borrow 
neither would he lend; and every 
man kept the hilt of his sword in 
his right hand, in the  a defence of 
his property and his own life and 
of his wives and children.

3 And now, after the space of two 
years, and after the death of Shared, 
behold, there arose the brother of 
Shared  and  he  gave  battle  unto 
Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr 
did beat him and did pursue him 
to the wilderness of Akish.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother  of  Shared  did  give  battle 
unto him in the wilderness of Akish; 
and the battle became exceedingly 
sore, and many thousands fell by 
the sword.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Cori-
antumr did lay siege to the wilder-
ness; and the brother of Shared did 
march forth out of the wilderness by  
night, and slew a part of the army of 
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.
6 And he came forth to the land 
of a Moron, and placed himself upon 
the throne of Coriantumr.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Cori-
antumr dwelt with his army in the 
wilderness  for  the  space  of  two 
years, in which he did receive great 
strength to his army.

CHAPTER 14

The iniquity of the people brings a curse 
upon the land—Coriantumr engages in 
warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and 
then  Shiz—Blood  and  carnage  cover 
the land.
And now there began to be a great 
a curse upon all the land because of 
the iniquity of the people, in which, 
if a man should lay his tool or his 
sword upon his shelf, or upon the 
place  whither  he  would  keep  it, 
behold, upon the morrow, he could 
not find it, so great was the curse 
upon the land.

2 Wherefore every man did cleave 

8 Now the brother of Shared, whose 
name was Gilead, also received great 
strength to his army, because of se-
cret combinations.

9 And it came to pass that his high 
priest murdered him as he sat upon 
his throne.

10 And it came to pass that one of 
the secret combinations murdered 
him in a secret pass, and obtained 
unto himself the kingdom; and his 
name was Lib; and Lib was a man of 
great stature, more than any other 
man among all the people.

11 And it came to pass that in the 
first year of Lib, Coriantumr came 
up  unto  the  land  of  Moron,  and 
gave battle unto Lib.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
fought with Lib, in which Lib did 
smite  upon  his  arm  that  he  was 
wounded;  nevertheless,  the  army 
of  Coriantumr  did  press  forward 
upon Lib, that he fled to the bor-
ders upon the seashore.

13 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr pursued him; and Lib gave 
battle unto him upon the seashore.
14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Lib 
did smite the army of Coriantumr, 
that they fled again to the wilder-
ness of Akish.

15 And it came to pass that Lib did 
pursue  him  until  he  came  to  the 
plains  of  Agosh.  And  Coriantumr 
had taken all the people with him 
as he fled before Lib in that quarter 
of the land whither he fled.

16 And when he had come to the 
plains of Agosh he gave battle unto 
Lib, and he smote upon him until 
he died; nevertheless, the brother 
of Lib did come against Coriantumr 
in the stead thereof, and the battle 
became  exceedingly  sore,  in  the 
which  Coriantumr  fled  again  be-
fore the army of the brother of Lib.
17 Now the name of the brother 
of Lib was called Shiz. And it came 
to  pass  that  Shiz  pursued  after 
Cori antumr, and he did overthrow 
many cities, and he did slay both 
women  and  children,  and  he  did 
burn the cities.

18 And there went a fear of Shiz 
throughout all the land; yea, a cry 
went forth throughout the land—
Who can stand before the army of 
Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth 
before him!

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people began to flock together in 
armies, throughout all the face of 
the land.

20 And they were divided; and a 
part  of  them  fled  to  the  army  of 
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the 
army of Coriantumr.

21 And  so  great  and  lasting  had 

been  the  war,  and  so  long  had 
been  the  scene  of  bloodshed  and 
carnage, that the whole face of the 
land was covered with the a bodies 
of the b dead.

22 And  so  swift  and  speedy  was 
the war that there was none left to 
bury the dead, but they did march 
forth from the shedding of a blood 
to  the  shedding  of  blood,  leaving 
the bodies of both men, women, and 
children strewed upon the face of 
the land, to become a prey to the 
b worms of the flesh.

23 And  the  a scent  thereof  went 
forth  upon  the  face  of  the  land,  
even upon all the face of the land; 
wherefore the people became trou-
bled by day and by night, because 
of the scent thereof.

24 Nevertheless, Shiz did a not cease 
to pursue Coriantumr; for he had 
sworn to avenge himself upon Cori-
antumr of the blood of his brother, 
who had been slain, and the word 
of  the  Lord  which  came  to  Ether 
that Coriantumr should not fall by 
the sword.

25 And thus we see that the Lord 
did visit them in the fulness of his 
a wrath, and their wickedness and 
abominations had prepared a way 
for their everlasting destruction.

26 And it came to pass that Shiz 
did  pursue  Coriantumr  eastward, 
even to the borders by the seashore, 
and there he gave battle unto Shiz 
for the space of three days.

27 And so terrible was the destruc-
tion among the armies of Shiz that 
the people began to be frightened, 
and began to flee before the armies 
of Coriantumr; and they fled to the 
land of Corihor, and swept off the 
inhabitants before them, all them 
that would not join them.

28 And  they  pitched  their  tents 
in the valley of Corihor; and Cori-
antumr  pitched  his  tents  in  the 
valley of Shurr. Now the valley of 
Shurr  was  near  the  hill  Comnor;

wherefore, Coriantumr did gather 
his  armies  together  upon  the  hill 
Comnor, and did sound a trumpet 
unto  the  armies  of  Shiz  to  invite 
them forth to battle.

29 And it came to pass that they 
came forth, but were driven again; 
and they came the second time, and 
they were driven again the second 
time. And it came to pass that they 
came again the third time, and the 
battle became exceedingly sore.

30 And it came to pass that Shiz 
smote  upon  Coriantumr  that  he 
gave him many deep wounds; and 
Coriantumr, having lost his blood, 
fainted,  and  was  carried  away  as 
though he were dead.

31 Now  the  loss  of  men,  women 
and children on both sides was so 
great that Shiz commanded his peo-
ple that they should not pursue the 
armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, 
they returned to their camp.

CHAPTER 15

Millions  of  the  Jaredites  are  slain  in 
battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble 
all the people to mortal combat—The 
Spirit of the Lord ceases to strive with 
them—The  Jaredite  nation  is  utterly 
destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains.

And it came to pass when Corian-
tumr had recovered of his wounds, 
he began to remember the a words 
which Ether had spoken unto him.
2 He  saw  that  there  had  been 
slain by the sword already nearly 
a two millions of his people, and he 
began to sorrow in his heart; yea, 
there had been slain two millions 
of mighty men, and also their wives 
and their children.

3 He began to repent of the evil 
which  he  had  done;  he  began  to 
remember  the  words  which  had 
been  spoken  by  the  mouth  of  all 
the prophets, and he saw them that 
they were fulfilled thus far, every 
whit;  and  his  soul  a mourned  and 
refused to be b comforted.

4 And it came to pass that he wrote 
an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him 
that he would spare the people, and 
he would give up the kingdom for 
the sake of the lives of the people.
5 And it came to pass that when 
Shiz  had  received  his  epistle  he 
wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, 
that  if  he  would  give  himself  up, 
that he might slay him with his own 
sword, that he would spare the lives  
of the people.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people repented not of their iniq-
uity; and the people of Coriantumr 
were stirred up to anger against the  
people of Shiz; and the people of  
Shiz were stirred up to anger against 
the people of Coriantumr; where-
fore, the people of Shiz did give bat-
tle unto the people of Coriantumr.
7 And when Coriantumr saw that 
he was about to fall he fled again 
before the people of Shiz.

8 And it came to pass that he came 
to the waters of Ripliancum, which, 
by  interpretation,  is  large,  or  to 
exceed  all;  wherefore,  when  they 
came to these waters they pitched 
their  tents;  and  Shiz  also  pitched 
his tents near unto them; and there-
fore on the morrow they did come  
to battle.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
fought an exceedingly sore battle, 
in which Coriantumr was wounded 
again, and he fainted with the loss 
of blood.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies  of  Coriantumr  did  press 
upon the armies of Shiz that they 
beat them, that they caused them 
to flee before them; and they did 
flee southward, and did pitch their 
tents in a place which was called  
Ogath.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
army of Coriantumr did pitch their 
tents by the hill Ramah; and it was 
that  same  hill  where  my  father 
Mormon did  a hide up the records 
unto the Lord, which were sacred.

ETHER 15  : 12–28

12 And it came to pass that they 
did gather together all the people 
upon all the face of the land, who 
had not been slain, save it was Ether.
13 And it came to pass that Ether 
did  a behold  all  the  doings  of  the 
people; and he beheld that the peo-
ple who were for Coriantumr were 
gathered  together  to  the  army  of 
Cori antumr;  and  the  people  who 
were  for  Shiz  were  gathered  to-
gether to the army of Shiz.

14 Wherefore,  they  were  for  the 
space  of  four  years  gathering  to-
gether the people, that they might 
get all who were upon the face of 
the land, and that they might re-
ceive all the strength which it was 
possible that they could receive.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they were all gathered together, ev-
ery one to the army which he would,  
with their wives and their children— 
both men, women and children be-
ing  armed  with  a weapons  of  war, 
having  shields,  and  b breastplates, 
and head-plates, and being clothed 
after the manner of war—they did 
march forth one against another to 
battle; and they fought all that day, 
and conquered not.

16 And it came to pass that when 
it was night they were weary, and 
retired to their camps; and after they 
had retired to their camps they took 
up a howling and a a lamentation for 
the loss of the slain of their people; 
and so great were their cries, their 
howlings  and  lamentations,  that 
they did rend the air exceedingly.
17 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they did go again to bat-
tle, and great and terrible was that 
day; nevertheless, they conquered 
not, and when the night came again 
they  did  rend  the  air  with  their 
cries, and their howlings, and their 
mournings, for the loss of the slain 
of their people.

18 And it came to pass that Corian-

tumr  wrote  again  an  epistle  unto 
Shiz,  desiring  that  he  would  not 
come  again  to  battle,  but  that  he 
would take the kingdom, and spare 
the lives of the people.

19 But  behold,  the  a Spirit  of  the 
Lord had ceased striving with them, 
and  b Satan  had  full  power  over 
the c hearts of the people; for they 
were  given  up  unto  the  hardness  
of their hearts, and the blindness of  
their minds that they might be de-
stroyed; wherefore they went again 
to battle.

20 And it came to pass that they 
fought all that day, and when the 
night  came  they  slept  upon  their 
swords.

21 And on the morrow they fought 

even until the night came.

22 And when the night came they 
were a drunken with anger, even as a 
man who is drunken with wine; and 
they slept again upon their swords.
23 And on the morrow they fought 
again; and when the night came they 
had all fallen by the sword save it 
were fifty and two of the people of 
Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of 
the people of Shiz.

24 And it came to pass that they 
slept upon their swords that night, 
and  on  the  morrow  they  fought 
again, and they contended in their 
might with their swords and with 
their shields, all that day.

25 And when the night came there 
were thirty and two of the people 
of  Shiz,  and  twenty  and  seven  of 
the people of Coriantumr.

26 And it came to pass that they 
ate  and  slept,  and  prepared  for 
death  on  the  morrow.  And  they 
were  large  and  mighty  men  as  to 
the strength of men.

27 And it came to pass that they 
fought for the space of three hours, 
and  they  fainted  with  the  loss  of 
blood.

the men of Coriantumr had received 
sufficient strength that they could 
walk,  they  were  about  to  flee  for 
their lives; but behold, Shiz arose, 
and also his men, and he swore in 
his wrath that he would slay Cori-
antumr or he would perish by the 
sword.

29 Wherefore, he did pursue them, 
and on the morrow he did overtake 
them; and they fought again with 
the sword. And it came to pass that 
when  they  had  a all  fallen  by  the 
sword, save it were Coriantumr and 
Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with 
the loss of blood.

30 And it came to pass that when 
Coriantumr  had  leaned  upon  his 
sword,  that  he  rested  a  little,  he 
smote off the head of Shiz.

31 And it came to pass that after 
he had smitten off the head of Shiz, 

that Shiz raised up on his hands and 
a fell; and after that he had strug-
gled for breath, he died.

32 And  it  came  to  pass  that  
a Coriantumr fell to the earth, and 
became as if he had no life.

33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, 
and said unto him: Go forth. And 
he went forth, and beheld that the 
words of the Lord had all been ful-
filled; and he a finished his b record; 
(and  the  c hundredth  part  I  have 
not written) and he hid them in a 
manner  that  the  people  of  Limhi 
did find them.

34 Now the last words which are 
written by a Ether are these: Whether 
the Lord will that I be translated, 
or that I suffer the will of the Lord 
in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it 
so be that I am b saved in the king-
dom of God. Amen.

The Book of Moroni

CHAPTER 1
Moroni writes for the benefit of the La-
manites—The  Nephites  who  will  not 
deny  Christ  are  put  to  death.  About 
a.d. 401–21.

NOW  I,  Moroni,  after  having 

made  an  end  of  abridging 
the account of the people of 
Jared, I had supposed a not to have 
written more, but I have not as yet 
perished;  and  I  make  not  myself 
known to the Lamanites lest they 
should destroy me.

2 For behold, their  a wars are ex-
ceedingly fierce among themselves; 
and because of their  b hatred they 
c put  to  death  every  Nephite  that 
will not deny the Christ.

3 And  I,  Moroni,  will  not  a deny 
the  Christ;  wherefore,  I  wander 
whithersoever I can for the safety 
of mine own life.

4 Wherefore,  I  write  a  few  more 
things,  contrary  to  that  which  I 
had supposed; for I had supposed 
not to have written any more; but  
I write a few more things, that per-
haps  they  may  be  of   a worth  unto 
my brethren, the Lamanites, in some 
future day, according to the will of  
the Lord.

MORONI 2  : 1–5  : 2

The words of Christ, which he spake 
unto his a disciples, the twelve whom 
he had chosen, as he laid his hands 
upon them—

2 And  he  called  them  by  name, 
saying: Ye shall a call on the Father 
in my name, in mighty prayer; and 
after ye have done this ye shall have 
b power that to him upon whom ye 
shall lay your c hands, d ye shall give 
the  Holy  Ghost;  and  in  my  name 
shall  ye  give  it,  for  thus  do  mine  
apostles.

3 Now  Christ  spake  these  words 
unto them at the time of his first 
appearing; and the multitude heard 
it  not,  but  the  disciples  heard  it; 
and on as many as they a laid their 
hands, fell the Holy Ghost.

CHAPTER 3

Elders  ordain  priests  and  teachers 
by  the  laying  on  of  hands.  About  
a.d. 401–21.
The  manner  which  the  disciples, 
who  were  called  the  a elders  of 
the church, b ordained c priests and 
teachers—

2 After they had prayed unto the 
Father in the name of Christ, they 
a laid their hands upon them, and 
said:

3 In  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  I 
ordain you to be a priest (or if he 
be a a teacher, I ordain you to be a 
teacher) to preach repentance and 
b remission  of  sins  through  Jesus 
Christ,  by  the  endurance  of  faith 
on his name to the end. Amen.

4 And after this manner did they 
a ordain priests and teachers, accord-
ing to the b gifts and callings of God 

unto men; and they ordained them 
by  the  c power  of  the  Holy  Ghost, 
which was in them.

CHAPTER 4
How elders and priests administer the 
sacramental bread is explained. About 
a.d. 401–21.
The  a manner of their  b elders and 
priests administering the flesh and 
blood  of  Christ  unto  the  church; 
and they administered it  c accord-
ing to the commandments of Christ; 
wherefore we know the manner to 
be true; and the elder or priest did 
minister it—

2 And they did kneel down with 
the a church, and pray to the Father 
in the name of Christ, saying:

3 O  God,  the  Eternal  Father,  we 
ask  thee  in  the  name  of  thy  Son, 
Jesus Christ, to bless and a sanctify 
this b bread to the souls of all those 
who  partake  of  it;  that  they  may 
eat  in  c remembrance  of  the  body 
of thy Son, and witness unto thee, 
O  God,  the  Eternal  Father,  that 
they are willing to take upon them 
the  d name of thy Son, and always 
remember him, and keep his com-
mandments  which  he  hath  given 
them,  that  they  may  always  have 
his e Spirit to be with them. Amen.

CHAPTER 6
Repentant  persons  are  baptized  and 
fellowshipped—Church members who 
repent are forgiven—Meetings are con-
ducted by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
About a.d. 401–21.
And now I speak concerning bap-
tism.  Behold,  elders,  priests,  and 
teachers  were  baptized;  and  they 
were not baptized save they brought 
forth  a fruit  meet  that  they  were 
b worthy of it.

2 Neither did they receive any unto 
baptism save they came forth with a 
a broken b heart and a contrite spirit, 
and  witnessed  unto  the  church 
that  they  truly  repented  of  all  
their sins.

3 And  none  were  received  unto 
baptism save they a took upon them 
the name of Christ, having a deter-
mination to serve him to the end.

4 And after they had been received 
unto  baptism,  and  were  wrought 
upon and a cleansed by the power of 
the Holy Ghost, they were numbered 

among  the  people  of  the  b church 
of  Christ;  and  their  c names  were 
taken, that they might be remem-
bered and nourished by the good 
word of God, to keep them in the 
right  way,  to  keep  them  continu-
ally d watchful unto prayer, e relying 
alone  upon  the  merits  of  Christ, 
who was the author and the finisher  
of their faith.

5 And  the  a church  did  meet  to-
gether b oft, to c fast and to pray, and 
to speak one with another concern-
ing the welfare of their souls.

6 And  they  did  a meet  together 
oft to partake of bread and wine, 
in  b remembrance  of  the  Lord  
Jesus.

7 And they were strict to observe 
that  there  should  be  a no  iniquity 
among them; and whoso was found 
to commit iniquity, and b three wit-
nesses of the church did condemn 
them before the c elders, and if they 
repented  not,  and  d confessed  not, 
their names were e blotted out, and 
they  were  not  f numbered  among 
the people of Christ.

8 But a as oft as they repented and 
sought forgiveness, with real b intent, 
they were c forgiven.

9 And their meetings were  a con-
ducted by the church after the man-
ner of the workings of the Spirit, 
and by the b power of the Holy Ghost; 
for as the power of the Holy Ghost 
led them whether to preach, or to 
exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, 
or to sing, even so it was done.

MORONI 7  : 1–12

CHAPTER 7

An  invitation  is  given  to  enter  into 
the  rest  of  the  Lord—Pray  with  real 
intent—The  Spirit  of  Christ  enables 
men  to  know  good  from  evil—Satan 
persuades men to deny Christ and do 
evil—The prophets manifest the com-
ing  of  Christ—By  faith,  miracles  are 
wrought  and  angels  minister—Men 
should hope for eternal life and cleave 
unto charity. About a.d. 401–21.
And now I, Moroni, write a few of  
the  words  of  my  father  Mormon, 
which he spake concerning a faith, 
hope,  and  charity;  for  after  this  
manner did he speak unto the peo-
ple, as he taught them in the b syna-
gogue which they had built for the 
place of worship.

2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto 
you,  my  beloved  brethren;  and  it 
is by the a grace of God the Father, 
and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his 
holy will, because of the gift of his 
b calling unto me, that I am permit-
ted to speak unto you at this time.
3 Wherefore, I would speak unto 
you that are of the a church, that are 
the b peaceable followers of Christ, 
and that have obtained a sufficient 
c hope by which ye can enter into 
the d rest of the Lord, from this time 
henceforth until ye shall rest with 
him in heaven.

4 And now my brethren, I judge 
these things of you because of your 
peaceable a walk with the children 
of men.

5 For I remember the word of God 
which saith by their a works ye shall 
know  them;  for  if  their  works  be 
good, then they are good also.

6 For behold, God hath said a man 
being a evil cannot do that which is 
good;  for  if  he  b offereth  a  gift,  or 
c prayeth unto God, except he shall 
do it with real d intent it profiteth 
him nothing.

7 For behold, it is not counted unto 

him for righteousness.

8 For behold, if a man being a evil 
giveth a gift, he doeth it b grudgingly; 
wherefore it is counted unto him 
the same as if he had retained the 
gift; wherefore he is counted evil 
before God.

9 And likewise also is it counted 
evil  unto  a  man,  if  he  shall  pray 
and not with a real intent of heart; 
yea, and it profiteth him nothing, 
for God receiveth none such.

10 Wherefore,  a  man  being  evil 
cannot do that which is good; nei-
ther will he give a good gift.

11 For behold, a bitter  a fountain 
cannot bring forth good water; nei-
ther can a good fountain bring forth 
bitter water; wherefore, a man being 
a servant of the devil cannot follow 
Christ; and if he b follow Christ he 
cannot be a c servant of the devil.

12 Wherefore,  all  things  which 
are a good cometh of God; and that 
which is b evil cometh of the devil; 
for the devil is an enemy unto God, 
and fighteth against him continu-
ally,  and  inviteth  and  enticeth

to c sin, and to do that which is evil 
continually.

13 But behold, that which is of God 
inviteth and enticeth to do  a good 
continually; wherefore, every thing 
which inviteth and b enticeth to do 
c good, and to love God, and to serve 
him, is d inspired of God.

14 Wherefore, take heed, my be-
loved brethren, that ye do not judge 
that  which  is  a evil  to  be  of  God,  
or that which is good and of God to  
be of the devil.

15 For behold, my brethren, it is 
given  unto  you  to  a judge,  that  ye 
may know good from evil; and the 
way to judge is as plain, that ye may 
know with a perfect knowledge, as 
the daylight is from the dark night.
16 For behold, the a Spirit of Christ 
is given to every b man, that he may 
c know  good  from  evil;  wherefore, 
I show unto you the way to judge; 
for  every  thing  which  inviteth  to 
do good, and to persuade to believe 
in Christ, is sent forth by the power 
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may 
know with a perfect knowledge it 
is of God.

17 But whatsoever thing persuad-
eth men to do a evil, and believe not 
in Christ, and deny him, and serve 
not  God,  then  ye  may  know  with  
a  perfect  knowledge  it  is  of  the  
devil;  for  after  this  manner  doth 
the devil work, for he persuadeth 
no man to do good, no, not one; nei-
ther do his angels; neither do they 
who subject themselves unto him.

18 And now, my brethren, seeing 
that  ye  know  the  a light  by  which 
ye  may  judge,  which  light  is  the 
light of Christ, see that ye do not 
judge  wrongfully;  for  with  that 
same b judgment which ye judge ye 
shall also be judged.

19 Wherefore,  I  beseech  of  you, 
brethren,  that  ye  should  search 
diligently  in  the  a light  of  Christ 
that ye may know good from evil; 
and if ye will lay hold upon every 
good thing, and condemn it not, ye 
certainly will be a b child of Christ.
20 And  now,  my  brethren,  how 
is it possible that ye can lay hold 
upon every good thing?

21 And now I come to that faith, 
of which I said I would speak; and 
I will tell you the way whereby ye 
may lay hold on every good thing.
22 For behold, God  a knowing all 
things, being from  b everlasting to 
everlasting, behold, he sent c angels 
to  minister  unto  the  children  of 
men,  to  make  manifest  concern-
ing  the  coming  of  Christ;  and  in 
Christ  there  should  come  every  
good thing.

23 And  God  also  declared  unto 
prophets, by his own mouth, that 
Christ should come.

24 And behold, there were divers 
ways  that  he  did  manifest  things 
unto  the  children  of  men,  which 
were good; and all things which are 
good  cometh  of  Christ;  otherwise 
men were a fallen, and there could 
no good thing come unto them.

MORONI 7  : 25–36

25 Wherefore, by the ministering 
of a angels, and by every word which 
proceeded forth out of the mouth 
of God, men began to exercise faith 
in  Christ;  and  thus  by  faith,  they 
did lay hold upon every good thing; 
and  thus  it  was  until  the  coming 
of Christ.

26 And after that he came men also 
were  a saved by faith in his name; 
and by faith, they become the b sons 
of God. And as surely as Christ liv-
eth he spake these words unto our 
fathers, saying: c Whatsoever thing 
ye shall ask the Father in my name, 
which is good, in faith believing that 
ye shall receive, behold, it shall be 
done unto you.

27 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, have a miracles ceased because 
Christ hath ascended into heaven, 
and hath sat down on the right hand 
of God, to b claim of the Father his 
rights of mercy which he hath upon 
the children of men?

28 For he hath answered the ends 
of the law, and he claimeth all those 
who have faith in him; and they who  
have faith in him will a cleave unto 
every good thing; wherefore he b ad-
vocateth the cause of the children 
of men; and he dwelleth eternally 
in the heavens.

29 And because he hath done this, 
my  beloved  brethren,  have  mira-
cles ceased? Behold I say unto you, 
Nay; neither have a angels ceased to 
minister unto the children of men.
30 For  behold,  they  are  subject 
unto him, to minister according to 
the word of his command, showing 
themselves  unto  them  of  strong  

faith and a firm mind in every form 
of a godliness.

31 And the office of their minis-
try is to call men unto repentance, 
and to fulfil and to do the work of 
the covenants of the Father, which 
he hath made unto the children of 
men, to prepare the way among the 
children of men, by declaring the 
word  of  Christ  unto  the  a chosen 
vessels of the Lord, that they may 
bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God 
prepareth the way that the a residue 
of men may have  b faith in Christ, 
that the Holy Ghost may have place 
in  their  hearts,  according  to  the 
power thereof; and after this man-
ner bringeth to pass the Father, the 
covenants which he hath made unto 
the children of men.

33 And  Christ  hath  said:  a If  ye 
will have b faith in me ye shall have 
power  to  do  whatsoever  thing  is 
c expedient in me.

34 And he hath said:  a Repent all 
ye ends of the earth, and come unto 
me, and be baptized in my name, 
and have faith in me, that ye may 
be saved.

35 And now, my beloved brethren, 
if this be the case that these things 
are true which I have spoken unto 
you, and God will show unto you, 
with a power and great glory at the 
last b day, that they are true, and if 
they are true has the day of mira-
cles ceased?

36 Or have angels ceased to appear 
unto the children of men? Or has 
he a withheld the power of the Holy 
Ghost  from  them?  Or  will  he,  so

long as time shall last, or the earth 
shall stand, or there shall be one man  
upon the face thereof to be saved?
37 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  Nay; 
for it is by faith that a miracles are 
wrought; and it is by faith that an-
gels appear and minister unto men; 
wherefore,  if  these  things  have 
ceased wo be unto the children of 
men, for it is because of b unbelief, 
and all is vain.

38 For no man can be saved, ac-
cording to the words of Christ, save 
they shall have faith in his name; 
wherefore,  if  these  things  have 
ceased, then has faith ceased also; 
and awful is the state of man, for 
they are as though there had been 
no redemption made.

39 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I judge better things of you, for 
I judge that ye have faith in Christ 
because of your meekness; for if ye 
have not faith in him then ye are 
not a fit to be numbered among the 
people of his church.

40 And again, my beloved brethren, 
I would speak unto you concerning  
a hope. How is it that ye can attain 
unto faith, save ye shall have hope?
41 And  what  is  it  that  ye  shall 
a hope  for?  Behold  I  say  unto  you 
that ye shall have b hope through the 
atonement of Christ and the power 
of  his  resurrection,  to  be  raised 
unto life c eternal, and this because 
of your faith in him according to  
the promise.

42 Wherefore, if a man have a faith 
he b must needs have hope; for with-
out faith there cannot be any hope.

43 And  again,  behold  I  say  unto 
you that he cannot have faith and 
hope, save he shall be a meek, and 
lowly of heart.

44 If so, his a faith and hope is vain, 
for none is b acceptable before God, 
save the c meek and lowly in heart; 
and if a man be meek and lowly in 
heart, and d confesses by the power 
of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the 
Christ,  he  must  needs  have  char-
ity; for if he have not charity he is 
nothing; wherefore he must needs 
have charity.

45 And a charity suffereth long, and 
is b kind, and c envieth not, and is not 
puffed up, seeketh not her own, is 
not easily  d provoked, thinketh no 
evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity 
but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth 
all things, believeth all things, hop-
eth all things, endureth all things.
46 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, if ye have not charity, ye are  
nothing, for charity never faileth. 
Wherefore,  cleave  unto  charity, 
which is the greatest of all, for all 
things must fail—

47 But  a charity  is  the  pure  b love 
of Christ, and it endureth c forever; 
and  whoso  is  found  possessed  of 
it  at  the  last  day,  it  shall  be  well 
with him.

48 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, a pray unto the Father with all 
the energy of heart, that ye may be 
filled with this love, which he hath 
bestowed  upon  all  who  are  true 
b followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; 
that  ye  may  become  the  sons  of 
God; that when he shall appear we

CHAPTER 8

The  baptism  of  little  children  is  an 
evil abomination—Little children are 
alive  in  Christ  because  of  the  Atone-
ment—Faith, repentance, meekness and 
lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy 
Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to 
salvation. About a.d. 401–21.
An epistle of my a father Mormon, 
written to me, Moroni; and it was 
written unto me soon after my call-
ing  to  the  ministry.  And  on  this 
wise did he write unto me, saying:
2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice 
exceedingly  that  your  Lord  Jesus 
Christ hath been mindful of you, 
and hath called you to his ministry, 
and to his holy work.

3 I am mindful of you always in 
my  prayers,  continually  praying 
unto God the Father in the name 
of  his  Holy  Child,  Jesus,  that  he, 
through his infinite a goodness and 
b grace, will keep you through the 
endurance of faith on his name to 
the end.

4 And now, my son, I speak unto 
you concerning that which griev-
eth me exceedingly; for it grieveth 
me that there should a disputations 
rise among you.

5 For, if I have learned the truth, 
there have been disputations among 
you concerning the baptism of your 
little children.

6 And now, my son, I desire that 
ye should labor diligently, that this 
gross error should be removed from 

among you; for, for this intent I have 
written this epistle.

7 For  immediately  after  I  had  
learned  these  things  of  you  I  in-
quired of the Lord concerning the 
matter. And the a word of the Lord 
came  to  me  by  the  power  of  the 
Holy Ghost, saying:

8 a Listen  to  the  words  of  Christ, 
your  Redeemer,  your  Lord  and 
your God. Behold, I came into the 
world not to call the righteous but 
sinners to repentance; the  b whole 
need no physician, but they that are  
sick; wherefore, little c children are 
d whole,  for  they  are  not  capable 
of committing e sin; wherefore the 
curse of f Adam is taken from them 
in me, that it hath no power over 
them; and the law of g circumcision 
is done away in me.

9 And after this manner did the 
Holy  Ghost  manifest  the  word  of 
God  unto  me;  wherefore,  my  be-
loved son, I know that it is solemn 
a mockery before God, that ye should 
baptize little children.

10 Behold I say unto you that this 
thing  shall  ye  teach—repentance 
and  baptism  unto  those  who  are 
a accountable and capable of com-
mitting sin; yea, teach parents that 
they must repent and be baptized, 
and  humble  themselves  as  their 
little  b children, and they shall all 
be saved with their little children.
11 And their little a children need 
no repentance, neither baptism. Be-
hold, baptism is unto repentance to 
the  fulfilling  the  commandments 
unto the b remission of sins.

12 But little a children are alive in 
Christ, even from the foundation of 
the world; if not so, God is a partial

God,  and  also  a  changeable  God, 
and  a  b respecter  to  persons;  for 
how many little children have died 
without baptism!

13 Wherefore,  if  little  children 
could  not  be  saved  without  bap-
tism,  these  must  have  gone  to  an 
endless hell.

14 Behold I say unto you, that he 
that supposeth that little children 
need baptism is in the gall of bitter-
ness and in the bonds of iniquity; 
for  he  hath  neither  a faith,  hope, 
nor charity; wherefore, should he 
be cut off while in the thought, he 
must go down to hell.

15 For awful is the wickedness to 
suppose that God saveth one child 
because of baptism, and the other 
must  perish  because  he  hath  no 
baptism.

16 Wo  be  unto  them  that  shall 
pervert the ways of the Lord after 
this manner, for they shall perish 
except they repent. Behold, I speak 
with  boldness,  having  a authority 
from God; and I fear not what man 
can  do;  for  b perfect  c love  d casteth 
out all fear.

17 And I am filled with a charity, 
which  is  everlasting  love;  where-
fore,  all  children  are  alike  unto 
me; wherefore, I love little children 
with a perfect love; and they are all 
alike and b partakers of salvation.

18 For  I  know  that  God  is  not  a 
partial God, neither a changeable 
being; but he is a unchangeable from 
b all eternity to all eternity.

19 Little a children cannot repent; 
wherefore, it is awful wickedness to 
deny the pure mercies of God unto 

them, for they are all alive in him 
because of his b mercy.

20 And  he  that  saith  that  little 
children  need  baptism  denieth 
the mercies of Christ, and setteth 
at  naught  the  a atonement  of  him 
and the power of his redemption.

21 Wo unto such, for they are in 
danger of death, a hell, and an b end-
less torment. I speak it boldly; God 
hath commanded me. Listen unto 
them and give heed, or they stand 
against you at the  c judgment-seat 
of Christ.

22 For behold that all little chil-
dren are a alive in Christ, and also all 
they that are without the b law. For 
the power of   c redemption cometh on 
all them that have d no law; where-
fore, he that is not condemned, or 
he that is under no condemnation, 
cannot repent; and unto such bap-
tism availeth nothing—

23 But it is mockery before God, 
denying the mercies of Christ, and 
the  power  of  his  Holy  Spirit,  and 
putting trust in a dead works.

24 Behold,  my  son,  this  thing 
ought not to be; for a repentance is 
unto them that are under condem-
nation  and  under  the  curse  of  a  
broken law.

25 And the first fruits of a repen-
tance  is  b baptism;  and  baptism 
cometh by faith unto the fulfilling 
the commandments; and the fulfill-
ing  the  commandments  bringeth 
c remission of sins;

26 And  the  remission  of  sins 
bringeth a meekness, and lowliness 
of heart; and because of meekness 
and lowliness of heart cometh the

visitation of the b Holy Ghost, which 
c Comforter d filleth with hope and 
perfect e love, which love endureth 
by f diligence unto g prayer, until the 
end shall come, when all the h saints 
shall dwell with God.

27 Behold,  my  son,  I  will  write 
unto you again if I go not out soon 
against the Lamanites. Behold, the 
a pride of this nation, or the people 
of the Nephites, hath proven their 
destruction  except  they  should  
repent.

28 Pray  for  them,  my  son,  that 
repentance may come unto them. 
But  behold,  I  fear  lest  the  Spirit 
hath  a ceased  b striving  with  them; 
and  in  this  part  of  the  land  they 
are  also  seeking  to  put  down  all 
power and authority which cometh 
from  God;  and  they  are  c denying 
the Holy Ghost.

29 And after rejecting so great a 
knowledge, my son, they must per-
ish soon, unto the fulfilling of the 
prophecies which were spoken by 
the prophets, as well as the words 
of our Savior himself.

30 Farewell, my son, until I shall 
write unto you, or shall meet you 
again. Amen.

The  second  epistle  of  Mormon  to 
his son Moroni.

Comprising chapter 9.

CHAPTER 9

Both the Nephites and the Lamanites 
are depraved and degenerate—They tor-
ture and murder each other—Mormon 

prays that grace and goodness may rest 
upon Moroni forever. About a.d. 401.

My  beloved  son,  I  write  unto  you 
again that ye may know that I am 
yet alive; but I write somewhat of 
that which is grievous.

2 For behold, I have had a sore bat-
tle with the Lamanites, in which we 
did not conquer; and Archeantus has 
fallen by the sword, and also Luram 
and Emron; yea, and we have lost  
a great number of our choice men.
3 And now behold, my son, I fear 
lest the Lamanites shall destroy this 
people; for they do not repent, and 
Satan stirreth them up continually 
to a anger one with another.

4 Behold, I am laboring with them 
continually; and when I speak the  
word of God with a sharpness they 
tremble and anger against me; and  
when I use no sharpness they b har-
den their hearts against it; where-
fore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord 
hath ceased c striving with them.

5 For so exceedingly do they anger 
that it seemeth me that they have 
no fear of death; and they have lost 
their love, one towards another; and 
they a thirst after blood and revenge 
continually.

6 And now, my beloved son, not-
withstanding their hardness, let us 
labor  a diligently; for if we should 
cease to b labor, we should be brought 
under condemnation; for we have a 
labor to perform whilst in this taber-
nacle of clay, that we may conquer 
the enemy of all righteousness, and 
rest our souls in the kingdom of God.
7 And now I write somewhat con-
cerning the sufferings of this people.

528

For  according  to  the  knowledge 
which I have received from Amoron, 
behold, the Lamanites have many 
prisoners, which they took from the 
tower of Sherrizah; and there were 
men, women, and children.

8 And  the  husbands  and  fathers 
of those women and children they 
have slain; and they feed the women 
upon the a flesh of their husbands, 
and the children upon the flesh of 
their fathers; and no water, save a 
little, do they give unto them.

9 And notwithstanding this great 
a abomination of the Lamanites, it 
doth not exceed that of our people 
in Moriantum. For behold, many of  
the daughters of the Lamanites have  
they taken prisoners; and after b de-
priving them of that which was most 
dear and precious above all things, 
which is c chastity and d virtue—

10 And  after  they  had  done  this 
thing, they did murder them in a 
most a cruel manner, torturing their 
bodies even unto death; and after 
they  have  done  this,  they  devour 
their  flesh  like  unto  wild  beasts, 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts; and they do it for a token of  
bravery.

11 O my beloved son, how can a 
people  like  this,  that  are  without 
civilization—

12 (And  only  a  few  years  have 
passed away, and they were a civil 
and a delightsome people)

13 But O my son, how can a peo-
ple  like  this,  whose  a delight  is  in 
so much abomination—

14 How  can  we  expect  that  God 
will  a stay  his  hand  in  judgment 
against us?

15 Behold,  my  heart  cries:  Wo 
unto this people. Come out in judg-
ment, O God, and hide their sins, 
and wickedness, and abominations 
from before thy face!

16 And  again,  my  son,  there  are 
many a widows and their daughters 
who remain in Sherrizah; and that 
part  of  the  provisions  which  the 
Lamanites did not carry away, be-
hold, the army of Zenephi has car-
ried away, and left them to wander 
whithersoever  they  can  for  food; 
and many old women do faint by 
the way and die.

17 And  the  army  which  is  with 
me is weak; and the armies of the 
Lamanites  are  betwixt  Sherrizah 
and me; and as many as have fled 
to the army of  a Aaron have fallen 
victims to their awful brutality.

18 O  the  depravity  of  my  peo-
ple!  They  are  without  a order  and 
without mercy. Behold, I am but a 
man, and I have but the b strength 
of a man, and I cannot any longer 
enforce my commands.

19 And they have become strong 
in  their  perversion;  and  they  are 
alike brutal, sparing none, neither 
old nor young; and they delight in 
everything save that which is good; 
and the suffering of our women and 
our  children  upon  all  the  face  of 
this land doth exceed everything; 
yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can 
it be written.

20 And  now,  my  son,  I  dwell  no 
longer  upon  this  horrible  scene. 
Behold, thou knowest the wicked-
ness of this people; thou knowest 
that  they  are  without  principle, 
and  past  feeling;  and  their  wick-
edness  doth  a exceed  that  of  the  
Lamanites.

21 Behold, my son, I cannot rec-
ommend  them  unto  God  lest  he 
should smite me.

22 But  behold,  my  son,  I  recom-
mend thee unto God, and I trust in 
Christ that thou wilt be saved; and 
I a pray unto God that he will b spare 
thy life, to witness the return of his

people unto him, or their utter de-
struction; for I know that they must 
perish except they c repent and re-
turn unto him.

23 And if they perish it will be like 
unto the a Jaredites, because of the 
wilfulness of their hearts, b seeking 
for blood and c revenge.

24 And if it so be that they perish, 
we know that many of our brethren 
have a deserted over unto the Laman-
ites, and many more will also desert 
over  unto  them;  wherefore,  write 
somewhat a few things, if thou art 
spared and I shall perish and not 
see thee; but I trust that I may see 
thee soon; for I have sacred records 
that I would b deliver up unto thee.
25 My  son,  be  faithful  in  Christ; 
and may not the things which I have 
written grieve thee, to weigh thee 
down unto a death; but may Christ 
lift  thee  up,  and  may  his  suffer-
ings  and  death,  and  the  showing 
his body unto our fathers, and his 
mercy and b long-suffering, and the 
hope of his glory and of eternal life, 
rest in your c mind forever.

26 And may the grace of God the 
Father, whose throne is high in the 
heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who sitteth on the  a right hand of 
his  power,  until  all  things  shall 
become subject unto him, be, and 
abide with you forever. Amen.

The gifts of the Spirit are dispensed to 
the faithful—Spiritual gifts always ac-
company faith—Moroni’s words speak 
from the dust—Come unto Christ, be 
perfected  in  Him,  and  sanctify  your 
souls. About a.d. 421.
Now  I,  Moroni,  write  somewhat 
as  seemeth  me  good;  and  I  write 
unto my brethren, the a Lamanites; 
and I would that they should know 
that more than b four hundred and 
twenty years have passed away since 
the  sign  was  given  of  the  coming 
of Christ.

2 And  I  a seal  up  b these  records, 
after I have spoken a few words by 
way of exhortation unto you.

3 Behold, I would exhort you that 
when ye shall read these things, if 
it be wisdom in God that ye should 
read them, that ye would remember 
how a merciful the Lord hath been 
unto the children of men, from the  
creation of Adam even down until  
the time that ye shall receive these 
things, and b ponder it in your c hearts.
4 And when ye shall receive these 
things, I would exhort you that ye 
would a ask God, the Eternal Father,  
in the name of Christ, if these things 
are  not  b true;  and  if  ye  shall  ask 
with a c sincere heart, with d real in-
tent, having e faith in Christ, he will 
f manifest the g truth of it unto you, 
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

just  and true;  wherefore, nothing 
that is good denieth the Christ, but 
acknowledgeth that he is.

7 And ye may a know that he is, by  
the power of the Holy Ghost; where-
fore I would exhort you that ye deny 
not the power of God; for he worketh 
by  power,  b according  to  the  faith 
of  the  children  of  men,  the  same 
today and tomorrow, and forever.

8 And  again,  I  exhort  you,  my 
brethren,  that  ye  deny  not  the 
a gifts  of  God,  for  they  are  many; 
and they come from the same God. 
And there are b different ways that 
these gifts are administered; but it 
is the same God who worketh all in 
all; and they are given by the mani-
festations of the c Spirit of God unto 
men, to profit them.

9 a For behold, to one is given by 
the Spirit of God, that he may b teach 
the word of wisdom;

10 And  to  another,  that  he  may 
a teach the word of b knowledge by 
the same Spirit;

11 And  to  another,  exceedingly 
great  a faith;  and  to  another,  the 
gifts of b healing by the same Spirit;
12 And again, to another, that he 

may work mighty a miracles;

13 And again, to another, that he 
may prophesy concerning all things;
14 And again, to another, the be-
holding of angels and ministering 
spirits;

15 And again, to another, all kinds 

of tongues;

16 And again, to another, the in-
terpretation  of  a languages  and  of 
divers kinds of tongues.

17 And all these gifts come by the 

Spirit of Christ; and they come unto 
every man severally, according as 
he will.

18 And  I  would  exhort  you,  my 
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that  a every good  b gift cometh 
of Christ.

19 And  I  would  exhort  you,  my 
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that he is the a same yesterday, 
today,  and  forever,  and  that  all 
these gifts of which I have spoken, 
which are spiritual, never will be 
done away, even as long as the world 
shall stand, only according to the 
b unbelief of the children of men.

20 Wherefore, there must be a faith; 
and if there must be faith there must 
also be hope; and if there must be 
hope there must also be charity.

21 And  except  ye  have  a charity 
ye  can  in  nowise  be  saved  in  the 
kingdom of God; neither can ye be 
saved in the kingdom of God if ye  
have  not  faith;  neither  can  ye  if  
ye have no hope.

22 And if ye have no hope ye must 
needs be in  a despair; and despair 
cometh because of iniquity.

23 And Christ truly said unto our 
fathers: a If ye have faith ye can do 
all things which are expedient unto  
me.

24 And now I speak unto all the 
ends of the earth—that if the day 
cometh that the power and gifts of 
God shall be done away among you, 
it shall be a because of b unbelief.

25 And  wo  be  unto  the  children 
of men if this be the case; for there 
shall  be  a none  that  doeth  good 
among you, no not one. For if there

be one among you that doeth good, 
he  shall  work  by  the  power  and 
gifts of God.

26 And wo unto them who shall 
do these things away and die, for 
they  a die  in  their  b sins,  and  they 
cannot  be  saved  in  the  kingdom 
of God; and I speak it according to 
the words of Christ; and I lie not.

27 And I exhort you to remember 
these things; for the time speedily 
cometh  that  ye  shall  know  that  I 
lie not, for ye shall see me at the 
bar of God; and the Lord God will 
say unto you: Did I not declare my 
a words unto you, which were writ-
ten by this man, like as one  b cry-
ing from the dead, yea, even as one 
speaking out of the c dust?

28 I declare these things unto the 
fulfilling  of  the  prophecies.  And 
behold,  they  shall  proceed  forth 
out of the mouth of the everlasting 
God; and his word shall a hiss forth 
from generation to generation.

29 And God shall show unto you, 
that  that  which  I  have  written  is 
a true.

30 And again I would exhort you 
that  ye  would  a come  unto  Christ, 
and lay hold upon every good b gift, 
and c touch not the evil gift, nor the 
d unclean thing.

31 And a awake, and arise from the 
dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on 
thy beautiful garments, O daugh-

ter  of  b Zion;  and  c strengthen  thy 
d stakes and enlarge thy borders for-
ever, that thou mayest e no more be 
confounded, that the covenants of 
the Eternal Father which he hath 
made unto thee, O house of Israel, 
may be fulfilled.

32 Yea, a come unto Christ, and be 
b perfected in him, and c deny your-
selves of all ungodliness; and if ye 
shall deny yourselves of all ungod-
liness, and d love God with all your 
might, mind and strength, then is 
his  grace  sufficient  for  you,  that 
by his grace ye may be e perfect in 
Christ; and if by the grace of God 
ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in 
nowise deny the power of God.

33 And again, if ye by the grace of 
God are perfect in Christ, and deny 
not his power, then are ye a sancti-
fied in Christ by the grace of God, 
through the shedding of the b blood 
of Christ, which is in the covenant  
of the Father unto the remission of  
your  c sins,  that  ye  become  d holy, 
without spot.

34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. 
I soon go to  a rest in the  b para dise  
of God, until my  c spirit and body 
shall  again  d reunite,  and  I  am 
brought forth triumphant through 
the e air, to meet you before the f pleas-
ing bar of the great  g Jehovah, the  
Eternal  h Judge of both quick and 
dead. Amen.
