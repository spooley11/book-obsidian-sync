Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and  
also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the  
house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of command-
ment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and 
sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To 
come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—
Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in  
due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift 
of God.
 An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of 
the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded 
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to 
heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what 
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know  
the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to  
the  convincing  of  the  Jew  and  Gentile  that Jesus  is  the Christ,  the  
Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there  
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things 
of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

- **34406_eng.pdf (chunk 3)**: The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal 
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His res-
urrection.
- **34406_eng.pdf (chunk 4)**: Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come 
to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, 
that Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days, and that 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom 
once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming 
of the Messiah.

The TeSTimOny Of Three WiTneSSeS

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom

this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, 
and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record,  
which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their 
brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of 
which hath been spoken.
