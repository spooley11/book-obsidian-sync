wife, saving for the cause of  b for-
nication,  causeth  her  to  commit 
c adultery;  and  whoso  shall  marry 
her  who  is  divorced  committeth  
adultery.

3 NEPHI 12  : 34–13  : 5

shalt b perform unto the Lord thine  
c oaths;

34 But  verily,  verily,  I  say  unto 
you,  a swear  not  at  all;  neither  by 
heaven, for it is God’s throne;

35 Nor  by  the  earth,  for  it  is  his

footstool;

36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy 
head, because thou canst not make 
one hair black or white;

37 But let your a communication be 
b Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever 
cometh of more than these is evil.
38 And behold, it is written, an a eye 
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
39 But I say unto you, that ye shall 
not a resist evil, but whosoever shall 
smite thee on thy right b cheek, c turn 
to him the other also;

40 And if any man will sue thee at 
the law and take away thy coat, a let  
him have thy cloak also;
