30 Therefore there was a a law given 
them, yea, a law of performances 
and of b ordinances, a law which they 
were to c observe strictly from day to 
day, to keep them in remembrance 
of God and their duty towards him.
31 But  behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
that all these things were a types of 
things to come.

32 And now, did they a understand 
the law? I say unto you, Nay, they 
did  not  all  understand  the  law; 
and  this  because  of  the  hardness 
of their hearts; for they understood 
not that there could not any man 
be  saved  b except  it  were  through 
the redemption of God.

33 For behold, did not Moses pro-
phesy  unto  them  concerning  the 
coming  of  the  Messiah,  and  that 
God should redeem his people? Yea, 
and even a all the prophets who have 
prophesied  ever  since  the  world

began—have they not spoken more 
or less concerning these things?

34 Have  they  not  said  that  a God 
himself should come down among 
the children of men, and take upon 
him the form of man, and go forth 
in mighty power upon the face of 
the earth?

35 Yea, and have they not said also 
that  he  should  bring  to  pass  the 
a resurrection of the dead, and that 
he,  himself,  should  be  oppressed 
and afflicted?

CHAPTER 14

Isaiah  speaks  messianically—The 
Messiah’s  humiliation  and  sufferings 
are set forth—He makes His soul an 
offering for sin and makes intercession 
for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53. 
About 148 b.c.
Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who 
hath  a believed  our  report,  and  to 
whom  is  the  arm  of  the  Lord  re-
vealed?

2 For he shall grow up before him 
as a tender plant, and as a root out 
of  dry  ground;  he  hath  no  form 
nor comeliness; and when we shall 
see him there is no beauty that we 
should desire him.

3 He is a despised and rejected of  
men;  a  man  of  sorrows,  and  ac-
quainted with grief; and we hid as 
it were our faces from him; he was 
despised, and we esteemed him not.
4 Surely he has a borne our b griefs, 
and carried our sorrows; yet we did 
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, 
and afflicted.
