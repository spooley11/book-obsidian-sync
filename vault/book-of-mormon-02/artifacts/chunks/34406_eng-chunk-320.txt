city, in unto the king, that I might 
know of the disposition of the king, 
and  that  I  might  know  if  I  might 
go in with my people and possess 
the land in peace.

6 And I went in unto the king, and 
he covenanted with me that I might 
possess the a land of Lehi-Nephi, and 
the land of Shilom.

7 And  he  also  commanded  that 
his people should depart out of the 
land, and I and my people went into 
the land that we might possess it.
8 And  we  began  to  build  build-
ings,  and  to  repair  the  walls  of 
the city, yea, even the walls of the 
city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of  
Shilom.

9 And we began to till the ground, 
yea, even with all manner of a seeds, 
with seeds of corn, and of wheat, 
and of barley, and with neas, and 
with sheum, and with seeds of all 
manner  of  fruits;  and  we  did  be-
gin to multiply and prosper in the  
land.

10 Now  it  was  the  cunning  and 
the  craftiness  of  king  a Laman,  to 
b bring  my  people  into  bondage, 
that  he  yielded  up  the  land  that 
we might possess it.

11 Therefore it came to pass, that 
after we had dwelt in the land for 
the space of twelve years that king 
Laman began to grow uneasy, lest 
by  any  means  my  people  should 
a wax strong in the land, and that 
they could not overpower them and 
bring them into bondage.

12 Now they were a a lazy and an 
b idolatrous people; therefore they 
were desirous to bring us into bond-
age, that they might glut themselves 
with the labors of our hands; yea, 
that  they  might  feast  themselves 
upon the flocks of our fields.

13 Therefore it came to pass that 
king  Laman  began  to  stir  up  his

people  that  they  should  contend 
with my people; therefore there be-
gan to be wars and contentions in  
the land.

14 For,  in  the  thirteenth  year  of 
my  reign  in  the  land  of  Nephi,  
away  on  the  south  of  the  land  of  
a Shilom, when my people were wa-
tering  and  b feeding  their  flocks,  
and  tilling  their  lands,  a  numer-
ous host of Lamanites came upon 
them and began to slay them, and 
to take off their flocks, and the corn 
of their fields.
