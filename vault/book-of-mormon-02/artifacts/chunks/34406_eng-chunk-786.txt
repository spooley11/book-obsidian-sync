15 And  it  came  to  pass  that 
a Nephi—having been visited by an-
gels and also the voice of the Lord, 
therefore having seen angels, and 
being eye-witness, and having had 
power given unto him that he might 
know  concerning  the  ministry  of 
Christ, and also being eye-witness 
to  their  quick  return  from  righ-
teousness unto their wickedness and  
abominations;

16 Therefore,  being  a grieved  for 
the  hardness  of  their  hearts  and 
the blindness of their minds—went 
forth  among  them  in  that  same 
year, and began to testify, boldly, 
repentance  and  remission  of  sins 
through  faith  on  the  Lord  Jesus  
Christ.

17 And  he  did  minister  many 
things unto them; and all of them 
cannot  be  written,  and  a  part  of 
them would not suffice, therefore 
they are not written in this book. 
And Nephi did minister with a power 
and with great authority.

18 And it came to pass that they 
were angry with him, even because 
he  had  greater  power  than  they, 
for it were a not possible that they 
could disbelieve his words, for so

Christ that angels did minister unto  
him daily.

19 And in the name of Jesus did he 
cast out devils and a unclean spirits; 
and even his b brother did he c raise 
from the dead, after he had been 
stoned and suffered death by the 
people.

20 And the people saw it, and did 
witness of it, and were angry with 
him because of his power; and he 
did also do  a many more miracles, 
in  the  sight  of  the  people,  in  the 
name of Jesus.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
thirty and first year did pass away, 
and there were but few who were 
converted  unto  the  Lord;  but  as 
many as were converted did truly 
signify unto the people that they 
had been a visited by the power and 
b Spirit of God, which was in Jesus 
Christ, in whom they believed.

22 And as many as had devils cast 
out  from  them,  and  were  a healed 
of their sicknesses and their infir-
mities, did truly manifest unto the
