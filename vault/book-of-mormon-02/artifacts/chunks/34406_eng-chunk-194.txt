that  supposeth  that  they  are  not, 
unto them will I speak particularly, 
and confine the words unto mine 
b own people; for I know that they 
shall be of great worth unto them in 
the c last days; for in that day shall 
they understand them; wherefore, 
for their good have I written them.

been a destroyed among the Jews be-
cause of iniquity, even so have they 
been destroyed from generation to

iquities;  and  never  hath  any  of 
them been destroyed save it were 
b foretold them by the prophets of  
the Lord.

10 Wherefore,  it  hath  been  told 
them  concerning  the  destruction 
which should come upon them, im-
mediately after my father left a Jeru-
salem; nevertheless, they b hardened 
their hearts; and according to my 
prophecy they have been destroyed, 
save it be those which are c carried 
away d captive into Babylon.

11 And now this I speak because 
of the a spirit which is in me. And 
notwithstanding  they  have  been 
carried  away  they  shall  return 
again, and possess the land of Je-
rusalem; wherefore, they shall be 
b restored again to the c land of their 
inheritance.
