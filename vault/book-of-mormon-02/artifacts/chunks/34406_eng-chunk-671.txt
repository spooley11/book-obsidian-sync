9 And now as Moroni had supposed 
that there  a should be men sent to 
the city of Nephihah, to the assis-
tance of the people to maintain that 
city, and knowing that it was easier 
to keep the city from falling into 
the hands of the Lamanites than to 
retake it from them, he supposed 
that  they  would  easily  maintain  
that city.

10 Therefore  he  retained  all  his 
force to maintain those places which 
he had recovered.

11 And  now,  when  Moroni  saw 
that the city of Nephihah was a lost 
he was exceedingly sorrowful, and 
began to doubt, because of the wick-
edness of the people, whether they 
should  not  fall  into  the  hands  of 
their brethren.

12 Now this was the case with all 
his  chief  captains.  They  doubted 
and marveled also because of the 
wickedness of the people, and this 
because  of  the  success  of  the  La-
manites over them.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni  was  angry  with  the  govern-
ment, because of their a indifference 
concerning  the  freedom  of  their  
country.

CHAPTER 60
Moroni  complains  to  Pahoran  of  the 
government’s  neglect  of  the  armies—
The  Lord  suffers  the  righteous  to  be 
slain—The Nephites must use all of their 
power and means to deliver themselves 
from  their  enemies—Moroni  threat-
ens  to  fight  against  the  government 
unless help is supplied to his armies.  
About 62 b.c.
And it came to pass that he wrote 
a again to the governor of the land, 
who  was  Pahoran,  and  these  are 
the words which he wrote, saying: 
Behold,  I  direct  mine  epistle  to 
Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, 
who is the chief judge and the b gov-
ernor over the land, and also to all

those who have been chosen by this 
people to govern and manage the 
affairs of this war.

2 For behold, I have somewhat to 
say unto them by the way of a con-
demnation; for behold, ye yourselves 
know that ye have been appointed 
to  gather  together  men,  and  arm 
them with swords, and with cime-
ters, and all manner of weapons of 
war of every kind, and send forth 
against the Lamanites, in whatso-
ever  parts  they  should  come  into  
our land.
