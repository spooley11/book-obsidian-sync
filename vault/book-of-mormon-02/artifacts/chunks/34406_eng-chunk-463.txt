in glory—The prison walls are rent and 
fall—Alma and Amulek are delivered, 
and their persecutors are slain. About 
82– 81 b.c.

And  it  came  to  pass  after  he  had 
made an end of speaking unto the 
people many of them did believe 
on his words, and began to repent, 
and to search the a scriptures.

2 But the more part of them were 
desirous  that  they  might  destroy 
Alma  and  Amulek;  for  they  were 
angry  with  Alma,  because  of  the 
a plainness of his words unto Zeez-
rom; and they also said that Amu-
lek had  b lied unto them, and had 
reviled against their law and also 
against their lawyers and judges.

3 And they were also angry with 
Alma  and  Amulek;  and  because 
they had a testified so plainly against 
their  wickedness,  they  sought  to 
b put them away privily.

4 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did  not;  but  they  took  them  and 
bound them with strong cords, and 
took  them  before  the  chief  judge 
of the land.

5 And the people went forth and 
witnessed against them—testifying 
that  they  had  reviled  against  the  
law, and their lawyers and judges of 
the land, and also of all the people  
that were in the land; and also testi-
fied that there was but one God, and 
that he should send his Son among 
the people, but he should a not save 
them;  and  many  such  things  did 
the people testify against Alma and 
Amulek. Now this was done before 
the chief judge of the land.

6 And it came to pass that Zeez-
rom  was  astonished  at  the  words 
which had been spoken; and he also 
knew concerning the a blindness of 
the  minds,  which  he  had  caused 
among  the  people  by  his  b lying

words;  and  his  soul  began  to  be 
c harrowed up under a  d conscious-
ness of his own guilt; yea, he began 
to be encircled about by the pains  
of hell.
