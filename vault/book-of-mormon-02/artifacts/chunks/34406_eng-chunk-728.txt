9 And it came to pass that they laid 
hold on them, and bound them and 
cast  them  into  prison.  And  there 
was  a  proclamation  sent  abroad 
that the judge was slain, and that 
the murderers had been taken and 
were cast into prison.

10 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow  the  people  did  assemble 
themselves together to a mourn and 
to  b fast, at the burial of the great 
chief judge who had been slain.

11 And thus also those judges who 
were at the garden of Nephi, and 
heard his words, were also gathered 
together at the burial.

12 And it came to pass that they 
inquired among the people, saying: 
Where are the five who were sent to 
inquire concerning the chief judge 
whether he was dead? And they an-
swered  and  said:  Concerning  this 
five whom ye say ye have sent, we 
know not; but there are five who are 
the murderers, whom we have cast  
into prison.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judges desired that they should be 
brought;  and  they  were  brought, 
and behold they were the five who 
were sent; and behold the judges in-
quired of them to know concerning 
the matter, and they told them all 
that they had done, saying:

of  the  judgment-seat,  and  when 
we  saw  all  things  even  as  Nephi 
had  testified,  we  were  astonished

insomuch that we fell to the earth; 
and when we were recovered from 
our astonishment, behold they cast 
us into a prison.

15 Now, as for the murder of this 
man,  we  know  not  who  has  done 
it;  and  only  this  much  we  know, 
we ran and came a according as ye 
desired, and behold he was dead, 
according to the words of Nephi.
