27 And  why  should  I  a yield  to 
sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why 
should I give way to b temptations, 
that the evil one have place in my 
heart to destroy my c peace and af-
flict my soul? Why am I d angry be-
cause of mine enemy ?

28 Awake,  my  soul!  No  longer 
a droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, 
and give place no more for the b en-
emy of my soul.

29 Do not a anger again because of 
mine enemies. Do not slacken my 
strength because of mine afflictions.
30 Rejoice, O my a heart, and cry 
unto  the  Lord,  and  say:  O  Lord,  I 
will  praise  thee  forever;  yea,  my

soul will rejoice in thee, my God, 
and the b rock of my salvation.

31 O Lord, wilt thou a redeem my 
soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of 
the  hands  of  mine  enemies?  Wilt 
thou make me that I may shake at 
the appearance of b sin?

32 May  the  gates  of  hell  be  shut 
continually before me, because that 
my a heart is broken and my spirit 
is  contrite!  O  Lord,  wilt  thou  not 
shut the gates of thy righteousness 
before me, that I may b walk in the 
path of the low valley, that I may 
be strict in the plain road!

33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me 
around  in  the  robe  of  thy  a righ-
teousness! O Lord, wilt thou make 
a way for mine escape before mine 
b enemies! Wilt thou make my path 
straight before me! Wilt thou not 
place a stumbling block in my way—
but that thou wouldst clear my way 
before  me,  and  hedge  not  up  my 
way, but the ways of mine enemy.
34 O Lord, I have a trusted in thee, 
and I will  b trust in thee forever. I 
will not put my  c trust in the arm 
of flesh; for I know that cursed is 
he  that  putteth  his  d trust  in  the 
arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that 
putteth his trust in man or maketh 
flesh his arm.
