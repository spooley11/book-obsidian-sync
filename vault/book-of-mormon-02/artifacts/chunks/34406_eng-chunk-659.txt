51 For Antipus had fallen by the 
sword, and many of his leaders, be-
cause of their weariness, which was 
occasioned  by  the  speed  of  their 
march—therefore the men of Anti-
pus, being confused because of the 
fall of their leaders, began to give 
way before the Lamanites.

52 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites took courage, and began 
to pursue them; and thus were the 
Lamanites pursuing them with great 
vigor  when  a Helaman  came  upon 
their rear with his two thousand, 
and began to slay them exceedingly, 
insomuch that the whole army of 
the  Lamanites  halted  and  turned 
upon Helaman.

53 Now  when  the  people  of  An-
tipus saw that the Lamanites had 
turned them about, they gathered 
together their men and came again 
upon the rear of the Lamanites.

54 And  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  we,  the  people  of  Nephi,  the  
people of Antipus, and I with my 
two  thousand,  did  surround  the 
Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, 
insomuch that they were compelled 
to deliver up their weapons of war

and  also  themselves  as  prisoners  
of war.

55 And now it came to pass that 
when they had surrendered them-
selves up unto us, behold, I num-
bered  those  young  men  who  had 
fought with me, fearing lest there 
were many of them slain.

56 But  behold,  to  my  great  joy, 
there  had  a not  one  soul  of  them 
fallen  to  the  earth;  yea,  and  they 
had fought as if with the b strength 
of God; yea, never were men known 
to have fought with such miracu-
lous strength; and with such mighty 
power did they fall upon the Laman-
ites,  that  they  did  frighten  them; 
and for this cause did the Lamanites 
deliver themselves up as prisoners  
of war.

57 And as we had no place for our  
prisoners, that we could guard them 
to keep them from the armies of the  
Lamanites, therefore we sent them 
to the land of Zarahemla, and a part 
of  those  men  who  were  not  slain 
of Antipus, with them; and the re-
mainder I took and joined them to 
my stripling a Ammonites, and took 
our march back to the city of Judea.
