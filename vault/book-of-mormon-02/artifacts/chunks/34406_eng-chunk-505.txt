33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  had  inhabited  the  land 
Bountiful, even from the east unto 
the west sea, and thus the Nephites 
in their wisdom, with their guards 
and their armies, had hemmed in 
the  Lamanites  on  the  south,  that 
thereby they should have no more 
possession on the north, that they 
might not overrun the land north-
ward.

34 Therefore the Lamanites could 
have no more possessions only in  
the land of Nephi, and the wilder-
ness  round  about.  Now  this  was 
wisdom  in  the  Nephites—as  the  
Lamanites were an enemy to them, 
they would not suffer their afflictions  
on every hand, and also that they 
might  have  a  country  whither 
they might flee, according to their  
desires.

35 And  now  I,  after  having  said 
this,  return  again  to  the  account 
of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and 
Himni, and their brethren.

CHAPTER 23
Religious freedom is proclaimed—The 
Lamanites  in  seven  lands  and  cities 
are  converted—They  call  themselves 
Anti-Nephi-Lehies and are freed from 
the  curse—The  Amalekites  and  the 
Amulonites  reject  the  truth.  About  
90–77 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that 
the  king  of  the  Lamanites  sent  a 
a proclamation among all his people, 
that they should not lay their hands 
on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or 
Himni, nor either of their brethren 
who should go forth preaching the 
word of God, in whatsoever place
