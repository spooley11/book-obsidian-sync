things in c worthiness, and do it in 
the name of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of the living God; and if ye do this, 
and endure to the end, ye will in 
nowise be cast out.

30 Behold,  I  speak  unto  you  as 
though I a spake from the dead; for 
I know that ye shall have my words.
31 Condemn  me  not  because  of 
mine  a imperfection,  neither  my 
father, because of his imperfection, 
neither them who have written be-
fore  him;  but  rather  give  thanks 
unto God that he hath made mani-
fest  unto  you  our  imperfections, 
that ye may learn to be more wise 
than we have been.

32 And now, behold, we have writ-
ten  this  record  according  to  our 
knowledge, in the characters which 
are called among us the a reformed 
Egyptian, being handed down and 
altered by us, according to our man-
ner of speech.

33 And  if  our  plates  had  been 
a sufficiently large we should have 
written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew 
hath been altered by us also; and if

we could have written in Hebrew, 
behold, ye would have had no b im-
perfection in our record.

34 But the Lord knoweth the things 
which  we  have  written,  and  also 
that none other people knoweth our 
language;  and  because  that  none 
other people knoweth our language, 
therefore he hath prepared a means 
for the interpretation thereof.

35 And  these  things  are  written 
that  we  may  rid  our  garments  of 
the  blood  of  our  a brethren,  who 
have dwindled in unbelief.

36 And behold, these things which 
we  have  a desired  concerning  our 
brethren,  yea,  even  their  restora-
tion to the knowledge of Christ, are 
according to the prayers of all the 
saints who have dwelt in the land.
37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ 
grant  that  their  prayers  may  be 
answered according to their faith; 
and may God the Father remember 
the covenant which he hath made 
with the house of Israel; and may 
he bless them forever, through faith 
on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
