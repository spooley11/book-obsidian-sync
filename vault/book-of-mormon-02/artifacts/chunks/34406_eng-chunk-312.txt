MOSIAH 7  : 16–25

Lamanites,  and  we  will  be  their 
c slaves;  for  it  is  better  that  we  be 
slaves to the Nephites than to pay 
tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
16 And now, king Limhi command-
ed his guards that they should no  
more bind Ammon nor his brethren,  
but caused that they should go to 
the hill which was north of Shilom, 
and bring their brethren into the 
city,  that  thereby  they  might  eat, 
and drink, and rest themselves from 
the labors of their journey; for they 
had suffered many things; they had 
suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.
17 And  now,  it  came  to  pass  on 
the morrow that king Limhi sent a  
proclamation among all his people,  
that  thereby  they  might  gather 
themselves together to the a temple, 
to hear the words which he should 
speak unto them.

18 And it came to pass that when 
they  had  gathered  themselves  to-
gether that he a spake unto them in 
this wise, saying: O ye, my people, 
lift up your heads and be comforted; 
for behold, the time is at hand, or 
is not far distant, when we shall no 
longer be in subjection to our en-
emies, notwithstanding our many 
strugglings,  which  have  been  in 
vain;  yet  I  trust  there  b remaineth 
an effectual struggle to be made.

19 Therefore, lift up your heads, 
and rejoice, and put your a trust in 
b God, in that God who was the God 
of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; 
and also, that God who c brought the 
children of d Israel out of the land  
of  Egypt,  and  caused  that  they 
should walk through the e Red Sea 
on dry ground, and fed them with 
f manna that they might not perish 
in the wilderness; and many more 
things did he do for them.

20 And again, that same God has 
brought our fathers a out of the land 
of Jerusalem, and has kept and pre-
served his people even until now; 
and behold, it is b because of our in-
iquities and abominations that he  
has brought us into bondage.
