15 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that 
they  fled,  all  that  were  not  over-
taken, even into the city of Nephi, 
and did call upon me for protection.
16 And it came to pass that I did 
arm them with bows, and with ar-
rows, with swords, and with cime-
ters, and with clubs, and with slings, 
and  with  all  manner  of  weapons 
which we could invent, and I and 
my people did go forth against the 
Lamanites to battle.

17 Yea, in the a strength of the Lord 
did  we  go  forth  to  battle  against 
the  Lamanites;  for  I  and  my  peo-
ple  did  cry  mightily  to  the  Lord 
that he would b deliver us out of the 
hands of our enemies, for we were 
awakened to a remembrance of the 
deliverance of our fathers.

18 And  God  did  a hear  our  cries 
and did answer our prayers; and we  
did go forth in his might; yea, we did  
go forth against the Lamanites, and 
in one day and a night we did slay 
three thousand and forty-three; we 
did  slay  them  even  until  we  had 
driven them out of our land.

19 And I, myself, with mine own 
hands, did help to bury their dead. 
And  behold,  to  our  great  sorrow  
and lamentation, two hundred and 
seventy-nine of our brethren were 
slain.
