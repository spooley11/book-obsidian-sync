unto himself, in a glory; and he doth  
suffer that they may do this thing, 
or that the people may do this thing 
unto them, according to the hard-
ness of their hearts, that the b judg-
ments which he shall exercise upon 
them in his wrath may be just; and 
the  c blood  of  the  d innocent  shall 
stand  as  a  witness  against  them, 
yea, and cry mightily against them 
at the last day.

12 Now Amulek said unto Alma: 
Behold, perhaps they will burn us 
also.

13 And Alma said: Be it according 
to the will of the Lord. But, behold, 
our work is not finished; therefore 
they burn us not.

14 Now it came to pass that when 
the bodies of those who had been 
cast into the fire were consumed, 
and also the records which were cast 
in with them, the chief judge of the 
land came and stood before Alma 
and Amulek, as they were bound; 
and he smote them with his hand 
upon their a cheeks, and said unto 
them: After what ye have seen, will 
ye preach again unto this people, 
that they shall be cast into a b lake 
of fire and brimstone?

15 Behold, ye see that ye had not 
power to save those who had been 
cast into the fire; neither has God 
saved  them  because  they  were  of 
thy faith. And the judge smote them 
again upon their cheeks, and asked: 
What say ye for yourselves?

16 Now  this  judge  was  after  the 
order and faith of a Nehor, who slew 
Gideon.

17 And it came to pass that Alma 
and Amulek answered him a noth-
ing; and he smote them again, and 
delivered them to the officers to be 
b cast into prison.

18 And when they had been cast

into prison three days, there came 
many  a lawyers,  and  judges,  and 
priests, and teachers, who were of 
the profession of Nehor; and they 
came in unto the prison to see them, 
and  they  questioned  them  about 
many  words;  but  they  answered 
them nothing.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
judge stood before them, and said: 
Why  do  ye  not  answer  the  words 
of this people? Know ye not that I 
have a power to deliver you up unto 
the  flames?  And  he  b commanded 
them to speak; but they answered  
nothing.
