16 Therefore, this was the a cause 
for which the sons of Mosiah had 
undertaken the work, that perhaps 
they  might  bring  them  unto  re-
pentance; that perhaps they might 
bring them to know of the plan of 
redemption.

17 Therefore they separated them-
selves one from another, and went 
forth among them, every man alone, 
according to the word and power 
of God which was given unto him.
18 Now  Ammon  being  the  chief 
among them, or rather he did ad-
minister unto them, and he departed 
from  them,  after  having  a blessed 
them  according  to  their  several 
stations, having imparted the word 
of God unto them, or administered 
unto them before his departure; and 
thus  they  took  their  several  jour-
neys throughout the land.

19 And Ammon went to the land 
of a Ishmael, the land being called 
after the sons of b Ishmael, who also 
became Lamanites.

20 And as Ammon entered the land 
of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him 
and a bound him, as was their cus-
tom to bind all the Nephites who 
fell into their hands, and carry them 
before the king; and thus it was left 
to the pleasure of the king to slay 
them, or to retain them in captivity,

or  to  cast  them  into  prison,  or  to  
cast them out of his land, according 
to his will and pleasure.

21 And thus Ammon was carried 
before the king who was over the 
land of Ishmael; and his name was 
Lamoni; and he was a descendant 
of Ishmael.

22 And the king inquired of Am-
mon if it were his desire to dwell 
in the land among the Lamanites, 
or among his people.
