26 Behold,  hath  he  commanded 
any that they should a depart out of 
the synagogues, or out of the houses 
of worship? Behold, I say unto you,  
Nay.

27 Hath he commanded any that 
they should not partake of his a sal-
vation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; 
but  he  hath  b given  it  free  for  all 
men; and he hath commanded his 
people that they should persuade 
all men to c repentance.

28 Behold,  hath  the  Lord  com-
manded any that they should not 
partake of his goodness? Behold I  
say unto you, Nay; but a all men are  
privileged  the  one  b like  unto  the 
other, and none are forbidden.

29 He  commandeth  that  there 
shall be no a priestcrafts; for, behold, 
priestcrafts  are  that  men  preach 
and set  b themselves up for a light 
unto the world, that they may get 
c gain and d praise of the world; but 
they seek not the e welfare of Zion.
30 Behold, the Lord hath forbid-
den this thing; wherefore, the Lord 
God  hath  given  a  commandment 
that all men should have a charity, 
which b charity is c love. And except 
they should have charity they were 
nothing. Wherefore, if they should 
have charity they would not suffer 
the laborer in Zion to perish.

31 But the a laborer in b Zion shall 
labor for Zion; for if they labor for 
c money they shall perish.

32 And again, the Lord God hath 
a commanded that men should not 
murder;  that  they  should  not  lie; 
that they should not b steal; that they 
should not take the name of the Lord  
their God in c vain; that they should 
not d envy; that they should not have 
e malice; that they should not con-
tend  one  with  another;  that  they 
should  not  commit  f whoredoms; 
and  that  they  should  do  none  of 
these things; for whoso doeth them 
shall perish.

33 For  none  of  these  iniquities 
come of the Lord; for he doeth that 
which is good among the children of 
men; and he doeth nothing save it 
be plain unto the children of men; 
and he a inviteth them b all to c come 
unto him and partake of his good-
ness; and he d denieth none that come
