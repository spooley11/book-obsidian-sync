8 And  when  the  servant  of  He-
laman had known all the heart of 
Kishkumen, and how that it was his 
a object to murder, and also that it 
was the object of all those who be-
longed to his band to murder, and 
to rob, and to gain power, (and this 
was  their  b secret  plan,  and  their 
combination) the servant of Hela-
man said unto Kishkumen: Let us 
go forth unto the judgment-seat.

9 Now this did please Kishkumen 
exceedingly, for he did suppose that 
he  should  accomplish  his  design; 
but behold, the servant of Helaman, 
as they were going forth unto the 
judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen 
even to the heart, that he fell dead 
without a groan. And he ran and 
told Helaman all the things which 
he had seen, and heard, and done.
10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  He-
laman did send forth to take this 
band  of  robbers  and  a secret  mur-
derers, that they might be executed 
according to the law.

11 But  behold,  when  Gadianton 
had found that Kishkumen did not 
return he feared lest that he should 
be destroyed; therefore he caused 
that  his  band  should  follow  him. 
And  they  took  their  flight  out  of

the land, by a secret way, into the 
wilderness; and thus when Helaman 
sent forth to take them they could 
nowhere be found.

12 And  more  of  this  Gadianton 
shall be spoken hereafter. And thus 
ended  the  forty  and  second  year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

13 And behold, in the end of this 
book ye shall see that this a Gadian-
ton did prove the overthrow, yea, 
almost the entire destruction of the 
people of Nephi.

14 Behold I do not mean the end 
of  the  a book  of  Helaman,  but  I  
mean the end of the book of Nephi, 
from  which  I  have  taken  all  the  
account which I have written.
