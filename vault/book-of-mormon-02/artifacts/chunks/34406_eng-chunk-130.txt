day, and he hath given me a knowl-
edge by b visions in the night-time.
24 And by day have I waxed bold 
in mighty a prayer before him; yea, 
my  voice  have  I  sent  up  on  high; 
and angels came down and minis-
tered unto me.

25 And upon the wings of his Spirit 
hath my body been a carried away 
upon exceedingly high mountains. 
And mine eyes have beheld great 
things, yea, even too great for man; 
therefore I was bidden that I should 
not write them.

26 O then, if I have seen so great 
things, if the Lord in his condescen-
sion unto the children of men hath 
a visited  men  in  so  much  b mercy, 
c why should my d heart weep and my 
soul linger in the valley of sorrow, 
and my flesh waste away, and my 
strength slacken, because of mine 
afflictions?
