20 And  the  Lord  said  unto  the 
brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt 
make a hole in the top, and also in 
the  bottom;  and  when  thou  shalt 
suffer for air thou shalt unstop the 
hole and receive air. And if it be so 
that the water come in upon thee, 
behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye  
may not perish in the flood.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did so, according 
as the Lord had commanded.

22 And  he  cried  again  unto  the 
Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have 
done even as thou hast commanded 
me; and I have prepared the vessels 
for my people, and behold there is 
no light in them. Behold, O Lord, 
wilt thou suffer that we shall cross 
this great water in darkness?

23 And  the  Lord  said  unto  the 
brother of Jared: What will ye that 
I should do that ye may have light 
in your vessels? For behold, ye can-
not have a windows, for they will be 
dashed in pieces; neither shall ye 
take fire with you, for ye shall not 
go by the light of fire.

24 For  behold,  ye  shall  be  as  a 
a whale in the midst of the sea; for 
the mountain waves shall dash upon 
you. Nevertheless, I will bring you 
up again out of the depths of the 
sea; for the b winds have gone forth 
c out of my mouth, and also the d rains 
and the floods have I sent forth.

25 And  behold,  I  prepare  you 
against these things; for ye cannot 
cross this great deep save I prepare 
you against the waves of the sea, and 
the winds which have gone forth, 
and  the  floods  which  shall  come. 
Therefore what will ye that I should 
prepare for you that ye may have 
light when ye are swallowed up in 
the depths of the sea?
