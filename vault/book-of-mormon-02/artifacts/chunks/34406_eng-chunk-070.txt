21 And it came to pass that they 
did  speak  unto  me  again,  saying: 
What  meaneth  this  thing  which 
our father saw in a dream? What 
meaneth the a tree which he saw?

22 And I said unto them: It was a

representation of the a tree of life.

23 And they said unto me: What 
meaneth  the  a rod  of  iron  which 
our father saw, that led to the tree?
24 And  I  said  unto  them  that  it 
was the  a word of God; and whoso 
would  hearken  unto  the  word  of 
God, and would b hold fast unto it, 
they  would  never  perish;  neither 
could  the  c temptations  and  the  
fiery d darts of the e adversary over-
power them unto blindness, to lead 
them away to destruction.

25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort 
them to give a heed unto the word 
of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them 
with all the energies of my soul, and 
with all the  b faculty which I pos-
sessed, that they would give heed 
to the word of God and remember

to keep his commandments always 
in all things.

26 And they said unto me: What 
meaneth the a river of water which 
our father saw?

27 And I said unto them that the 
a water  which  my  father  saw  was 
b filthiness;  and  so  much  was  his 
mind swallowed up in other things 
that he beheld not the filthiness of 
the water.

28 And I said unto them that it was 
an awful a gulf, which separated the 
wicked  from  the  tree  of  life,  and 
also from the saints of God.

29 And  I  said  unto  them  that  it 
was a representation of that awful 
a hell, which the angel said unto me 
was prepared for the wicked.

30 And  I  said  unto  them  that  
our father also saw that the a justice 
of God did also divide the wicked 
from the righteous; and the bright-
ness  thereof  was  like  unto  the 
brightness of a flaming b fire, which 
ascendeth up unto God forever and 
ever, and hath no end.

31 And they said unto me: Doth 
this thing mean the torment of the 
body in the days of a probation, or 
doth it mean the final state of the 
soul after the b death of the temporal 
body, or doth it speak of the things 
which are temporal?
