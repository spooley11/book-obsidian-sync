19 For he that diligently a seeketh 
shall find; and the b mysteries of God 
shall be unfolded unto them, by the 
power of the c Holy Ghost, as well in 
these times as in times of old, and 
as well in times of old as in times 
to come; wherefore, the d course of 
the Lord is one eternal round.

20 Therefore  remember,  O  man, 
for  all  thy  doings  thou  shalt  be 
brought into a judgment.

21 Wherefore,  if  ye  have  sought 
to do a wickedly in the days of your 
b probation, then ye are found c un-
clean before the judgment-seat of 
God; and no unclean thing can dwell 
with  God;  wherefore,  ye  must  be 
cast off forever.

22 And the Holy Ghost giveth a au-
thority  that  I  should  speak  these 
things, and deny them not.

CHAPTER 11

Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and 
is shown in vision the tree of life—He 
sees the mother of the Son of God and 
learns of the condescension of God—He 
sees the baptism, ministry, and cruci-
fixion  of  the  Lamb  of  God—He  sees 
also the call and ministry of the Twelve  
Apostles  of  the  Lamb.  About  600 –
592 b.c.

For it came to pass after I had de-
sired  to  know  the  things  that  my 
father had seen, and believing that 
the  Lord  was  able  to  make  them 
known unto me, as I sat a pondering 
in mine heart I was b caught away in  
the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an 
exceedingly high c mountain, which 
I never had before seen, and upon 
which I never had before set my foot.
2 And the Spirit said unto me: Be-

hold, what a desirest thou?

3 And  I  said:  I  desire  to  behold

the things which my father a saw.

4 And  the  Spirit  said  unto  me: 
a Believest thou that thy father saw 
the b tree of which he hath spoken?
5 And  I  said:  Yea,  thou  knowest 
that I a believe all the words of my 
father.
