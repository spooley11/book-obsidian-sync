54 And,  behold,  the  roots  of  the 
natural branches of the tree which 
I planted whithersoever I would are 
yet alive; wherefore, that I may pre-
serve them also for mine own pur-
pose, I will take of the a branches of 
this tree, and I will b graft them in 
unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto 
them the branches of their mother 
tree, that I may preserve the roots 
also unto mine own self, that when 
they  shall  be  sufficiently  strong 
perhaps they may bring forth good 
fruit unto me, and I may yet have 
glory in the fruit of my vineyard.

55 And it came to pass that they 
took  from  the  natural  tree  which 
had  become  wild,  and  grafted  in 
unto the natural trees, which also 
had become wild.

56 And they also took of the natu-
ral trees which had become wild, 
and a grafted into their mother tree.
57 And the Lord of the vineyard 
said unto the servant: Pluck not the 
wild branches from the trees, save 
it be those which are most bitter; 
and in them ye shall graft accord-
ing to that which I have said.

58 And we will nourish again the 
trees of the vineyard, and we will 
trim up the a branches thereof; and 
we will pluck from the trees those 
branches  which  are  ripened,  that 
must  perish,  and  cast  them  into 
the fire.

59 And this I do that, perhaps, the 
roots thereof may take strength be-
cause of their goodness; and because 
of the change of the branches, that 
the good may a overcome the evil.
60 And  because  that  I  have  pre-
served  the  natural  branches  and  
the roots thereof, and that I have 
grafted in the natural branches again 
into  their  mother  tree,  and  have 
preserved the roots of their mother 
tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my 
vineyard  may  bring  forth  again 
good a fruit; and that I may have joy 
again in the fruit of my vineyard, 
and,  perhaps,  that  I  may  rejoice 
exceedingly that I have preserved 
the roots and the branches of the  
first fruit—
