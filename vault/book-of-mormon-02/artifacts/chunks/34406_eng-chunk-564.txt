my God, to be judged of my b deeds.

was b harrowed up by the c memory 
of my many sins, behold, I d remem-
bered also to have heard my father 
prophesy unto the people concern-
ing the coming of one Jesus Christ, 
a Son of God, to atone for the sins 
of the world.

18 Now, as my mind caught hold 
upon  this  thought,  I  cried  within 
my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, 
a have mercy on me, who am b in the 
c gall of bitterness, and am encircled 
about by the everlasting d chains of  
e death.

19 And now, behold, when I thought  
this, I could remember my  a pains 
b no more; yea, I was harrowed up 
by the memory of my sins no more.
20 And  oh,  what  a joy,  and  what 
marvelous light I did behold; yea, 
my soul was filled with joy as ex-
ceeding as was my pain!
