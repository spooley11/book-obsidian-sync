JACOB 1  : 15–2  : 7

15 And now it came to pass that 
the people of Nephi, under the reign 
of the second king, began to grow 
hard  in  their  hearts,  and  indulge 
themselves  somewhat  in  wicked 
practices, such as like unto David of 
old desiring many a wives and b con-
cubines, and also Solomon, his son.
16 Yea,  and  they  also  began  to 
search much a gold and silver, and 
began  to  be  lifted  up  somewhat 
in pride.

17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto 
them these words as I taught them 
in the a temple, having first obtained 
mine b errand from the Lord.

18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Jo-
seph had been a consecrated priests 
and b teachers of this people, by the 
hand of Nephi.

19 And we did a magnify our office 
unto the Lord, taking upon us the 
b responsibility, answering the sins 
of the people upon our own heads if 
we did not c teach them the word of 
God with all diligence; wherefore, 
by  laboring  with  our  might  their 
d blood  might  not  come  upon  our 
garments;  otherwise  their  blood 
would  come  upon  our  garments, 
and we would not be found spot-
less at the last day.

CHAPTER 2
Jacob  denounces  the  love  of  riches, 
pride, and unchastity—Men may seek 
riches  to  help  their  fellowmen—The 
Lord  commands  that  no  man  among 
the Nephites may have more than one 
wife—The Lord delights in the chastity 
of women. About 544–421 b.c.

The  a words  which  Jacob,  the 
brother  of  Nephi,  spake  unto  the 
people  of  Nephi,  after  the  death  
of Nephi:
