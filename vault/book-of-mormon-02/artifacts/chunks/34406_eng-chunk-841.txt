11 Therefore it shall come to pass 
that whosoever will not believe in 
my  words,  who  am  Jesus  Christ, 
which the Father shall cause a him 
to  bring  forth  unto  the  b Gentiles, 
and shall give unto him power that 
he shall bring them forth unto the 
Gentiles, (it shall be done even as

Moses  said)  they  shall  be  c cut  off 
from among my people who are of 
the covenant.

12 And my people who are a rem-
nant of Jacob shall be among the 
Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as 
a a lion among the beasts of the for-
est, as a young lion among the flocks 
of sheep, who, if he go through both 
treadeth down and teareth in pieces, 
and none can deliver.

13 Their hand shall be lifted up 
upon their a adversaries, and all their 
enemies shall be cut off.

14 Yea,  wo  be  unto  the  Gentiles 
except  they  a repent;  for  it  shall 
come to pass in that day, saith the 
Father, that I will cut off thy horses 
out of the midst of thee, and I will 
destroy thy b chariots;

15 And I will cut off the cities of 
thy land, and throw down all thy 
a strongholds;

16 And I will cut off a witchcrafts 
out of thy land, and thou shalt have 
no more soothsayers;

17 Thy a graven images I will also 
cut  off,  and  thy  standing  images 
out of the midst of thee, and thou 
shalt  no  more  worship  the  works 
of thy hands;

18 And I will pluck up thy a groves 
out of the midst of thee; so will I 
destroy thy cities.

19 And it shall come to pass that 
all a lyings, and deceivings, and en-
vyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, 
and whoredoms, shall be done away.
20 For it shall come to pass, saith 
the Father, that at that  a day who-
soever  will  not  repent  and  come 
unto my Beloved Son, them will I
