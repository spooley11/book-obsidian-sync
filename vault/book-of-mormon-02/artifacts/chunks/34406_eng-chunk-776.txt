31 And it came to pass that they 
did break forth, all as one, in sing-
ing,  and  a praising  their  God  for 
the great thing which he had done 
for them, in preserving them from 
falling  into  the  hands  of  their  
enemies.

32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to 
the Most High God. And they did 
cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord 
God a Almighty, the Most High God.
33 And their hearts were swollen 
with joy, unto the gushing out of 
many  tears,  because  of  the  great 
goodness of God in delivering them 
out of the hands of their enemies; 
and  they  knew  it  was  because  of 
their repentance and their humility 
that they had been delivered from 
an everlasting destruction.

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites repent and forsake their 
sins—Mormon writes the history of his 
people and declares the everlasting word 
to them—Israel will be gathered in from 
her long dispersion. About a.d. 22–26.

And now behold, there was not a 
living  soul  among  all  the  people 
of the Nephites who did a doubt in 
the least the words of all the holy 
prophets who had spoken; for they 
knew  that  it  must  needs  be  that 
they must be fulfilled.

2 And they knew that it must be 
expedient that Christ had come, be-
cause of the many signs which had 
been given, according to the words 
of the prophets; and because of the 
things which had come to pass al-
ready they knew that it must needs 
be that all things should come to 
pass according to that which had 
been spoken.
