25 And it came to pass that he be-
gat Com, and Com reigned in his 
stead; and he reigned forty and nine 
years,  and  he  begat  Heth;  and  he 
also begat other sons and daughters.
26 And  the  people  had  spread 
again over all the face of the land, 
and there began again to be an ex-
ceedingly  great  wickedness  upon 
the  face  of  the  land,  and  a Heth 
began to embrace the secret plans 
again of old, to destroy his father.
27 And it came to pass that he did 
dethrone his father, for he slew him 
with  his  own  sword;  and  he  did 
reign in his stead.

28 And  there  came  prophets  in 
the land a again, crying repentance 
unto  them—that  they  must  pre-
pare the way of the Lord or there 
should come a curse upon the face 
of the land; yea, even there should 
be  a  great  famine,  in  which  they 
should be destroyed if they did not  
repent.

29 But the people believed not the 
words of the prophets, but they cast 
them out; and some of them they 
cast into a pits and left them to per-
ish. And it came to pass that they 
did all these things according to the 
commandment of the king, Heth.

30 And it came to pass that there 
began to be a great a dearth upon the 
land, and the inhabitants began to be 
destroyed exceedingly fast because

of the dearth, for there was no rain 
upon the face of the earth.

31 And there came forth a poison-
ous serpents also upon the face of 
the land, and did poison many peo-
ple. And it came to pass that their 
flocks began to flee before the poi-
sonous serpents, towards the land 
b southward,  which  was  called  by 
the Nephites c Zarahemla.

32 And it came to pass that there 
were many of them which did per-
ish by the way; nevertheless, there 
were some which fled into the land 
southward.
