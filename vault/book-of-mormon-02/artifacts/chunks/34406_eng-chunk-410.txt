2 But  the  people  were  afflicted, 
yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of 
their brethren, and also for the a loss 
of their flocks and herds, and also 
for the loss of their fields of grain, 
which were trodden under foot and 
destroyed by the Lamanites.

3 And so great were their afflic-
tions that every soul had cause to 
mourn;  and  they  believed  that  it 
was the judgments of God sent upon 
them because of their wickedness 
and their abominations; therefore 
they were a awakened to a remem-
brance of their duty.

4 And they began to establish the 
a church more fully; yea, and many 
were b baptized in the c waters of Si-
don and were joined to the church 
of God; yea, they were baptized by 
the  hand  of  Alma,  who  had  been 
consecrated  the  d high  priest  over 
the  people  of  the  church,  by  the 
hand of his father Alma.

5 And it came to pass in the seventh 
year of the reign of the judges there 
were about three thousand five hun-
dred souls that united themselves to 
the a church of God and were baptized. 
And thus ended the seventh year of 
the reign of the judges over the people

peace in all that time.

6 And it came to pass in the eighth 
year  of  the  reign  of  the  judges, 
that the people of the church be-
gan to wax proud, because of their 
exceeding  a riches, and their  b fine 
silks, and their fine-twined linen, 
and because of their many flocks 
and herds, and their gold and their 
silver, and all manner of precious 
things,  which  they  had  obtained

things  were  they  lifted  up  in  the 
pride of their eyes, for they began 
to wear very costly d apparel.
