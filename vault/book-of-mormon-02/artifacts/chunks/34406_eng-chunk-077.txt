their  father,  and  because  of  their 
b afflictions in the wilderness; and 
they did c murmur against my father, 
because he had brought them out of 
the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our  
father is dead; yea, and we have wan-
dered much in the wilderness, and 
we have suffered much affliction,  
hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after 
all these sufferings we must perish 
in the wilderness with hunger.

36 And  thus  they  did  murmur 
against my father, and also against 
me; and they were desirous to a re-
turn again to Jerusalem.

37 And Laman said unto Lemuel 
and also unto the sons of Ishmael: 
Behold, let us a slay our father, and 
also  our  brother  Nephi,  who  has 
taken it upon him to be our b ruler 
and our teacher, who are his elder 
brethren.

38 Now, he says that the Lord has 
talked with him, and also that a an-
gels have ministered unto him. But 
behold, we know that he lies unto 
us; and he tells us these things, and 
he  worketh  many  things  by  his 
cunning arts, that he may deceive 
our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he 
may lead us away into some strange 
wilderness;  and  after  he  has  led 
us  away,  he  has  thought  to  make 
himself a king and a ruler over us, 
that he may do with us according 
to his will and pleasure. And after 
this manner did my brother Laman 
b stir up their hearts to c anger.

39 And it came to pass that the Lord 
was with us, yea, even the voice of 
the Lord came and did speak many 
words  unto  them,  and  did  a chas-
ten  them  exceedingly;  and  after  
they were chastened by the voice of 
the Lord they did turn away their  
anger, and did repent of their sins,

insomuch  that  the  Lord  did  bless 
us again with food, that we did not 
perish.
