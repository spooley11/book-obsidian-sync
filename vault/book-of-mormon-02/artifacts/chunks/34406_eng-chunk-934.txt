22 And whatsoever  a nation shall 
uphold such secret combinations, 
to get power and gain, until they 
shall spread over the nation, behold, 
they shall be destroyed; for the Lord 
will not suffer that the b blood of his 
saints, which shall be shed by them, 
shall always cry unto him from the 
ground for c vengeance upon them 
and yet he avenge them not.

23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is 
wisdom  in  God  that  these  things 
should  be  shown  unto  you,  that 
thereby ye may repent of your sins, 
and suffer not that these murderous 
combinations shall get above you,

which are built up to get a power and 
gain—and the work, yea, even the 
work of b destruction come upon you, 
yea, even the sword of the justice of  
the Eternal God shall fall upon you, 
to your overthrow and destruction 
if ye shall suffer these things to be.
24 Wherefore, the Lord command-
eth  you,  when  ye  shall  see  these 
things  come  among  you  that  ye 
shall awake to a sense of your aw-
ful situation, because of this a secret 
combination which shall be among 
you;  or  wo  be  unto  it,  because  of 
the blood of them who have been 
slain; for they cry from the dust for 
vengeance upon it, and also upon 
those who built it up.
