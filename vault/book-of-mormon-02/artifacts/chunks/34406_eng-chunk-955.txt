ETHER 13  : 12–25

they have been washed in the blood 
of the Lamb; and they are they who 
were scattered and gathered in from 
the four quarters of the earth, and 
from the b north countries, and are 
partakers  of  the  fulfilling  of  the 
covenant  which  God  made  with 
their father, c Abraham.

12 And when these things come, 
bringeth to pass the scripture which 
saith, there are they who were a first, 
who shall be last; and there are they 
who were last, who shall be first.

13 And I was about to write more, 
but I am forbidden; but great and 
marvelous were the prophecies of 
Ether;  but  they  esteemed  him  as 
naught, and cast him out; and he 
a hid himself in the cavity of a rock 
by day, and by night he went forth 
viewing  the  things  which  should 
come upon the people.

14 And as he dwelt in the cavity 
of a rock he made the a remainder 
of this record, viewing the destruc-
tions which came upon the people, 
by night.

15 And it came to pass that in that 
same year in which he was cast out 
from among the people there began 
to be a great war among the people, 
for there were many who rose up, 
who were mighty men, and sought 
to destroy Coriantumr by their se-
cret plans of wickedness, of which 
hath been spoken.

16 And  now  Coriantumr,  having 
studied,  himself,  in  all  the  arts 
of war and all the cunning of the 
world, wherefore he gave battle unto 
them who sought to destroy him.

17 But he repented not, neither his 
a fair sons nor daughters; neither the 
fair sons and daughters of Cohor; 
neither the fair sons and daughters 
of Corihor; and in fine, there were 
none of the fair sons and daughters

upon  the  face  of  the  whole  earth 
who repented of their sins.

18 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
in  the  first  year  that  Ether  dwelt 
in the cavity of a rock, there were 
many people who were slain by the 
sword of those a secret combinations, 
fighting  against  Coriantumr  that 
they might obtain the kingdom.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
sons  of  Coriantumr  fought  much 
and bled much.
