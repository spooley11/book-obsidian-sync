39 Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you, 
that this is my a doctrine, and whoso 
b buildeth upon this buildeth upon 
my rock, and the c gates of hell shall 
not prevail against them.

40 And whoso shall a declare more 
or  less  than  this,  and  establish  it 
for my doctrine, the same cometh 
of  evil,  and  is  not  built  upon  my 
rock; but he buildeth upon a b sandy 
foundation,  and  the  gates  of  hell 
stand  open  to  receive  such  when 
the floods come and the winds beat  
upon them.

41 Therefore,  go  forth  unto  this 
people, and declare the words which 
I  have  spoken,  unto  the  ends  of  
the earth.

CHAPTER 12
Jesus calls and commissions the twelve 
disciples—He delivers to the Nephites a 
discourse similar to the Sermon on the 
Mount—He speaks the Beatitudes—His 
teachings  transcend  and  take  prece-
dence over the law of Moses—Men are 
commanded  to  be  perfect  even  as  He 
and His Father are perfect—Compare 
Matthew 5. About a.d. 34.
a And  it  came  to  pass  that  when 
Jesus had spoken these words unto 
Nephi, and to those who had been 
called,  (now  the  number  of  them 
who had been called, and received 
power and authority to b baptize, was 
c twelve) and behold, he stretched 
forth his hand unto the multitude,
