“After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and 
I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experi-
enced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had as-
cended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day 
was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole 
of that night.

“I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary 
labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found 
my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who 
was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, 
and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; 
but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my 
strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a 
time was quite unconscious of anything.

“The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, call-
ing me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing 
over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto 
me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me 
to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which 
I had received.

“I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole 
matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and 
do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place 
where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing 
to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew 
the place the instant that I arrived there.
