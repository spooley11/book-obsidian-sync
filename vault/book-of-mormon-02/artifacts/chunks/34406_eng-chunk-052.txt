3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  be-
held many generations pass away, 
after the manner of wars and con-
tentions in the land; and I beheld 
many cities, yea, even that I did not 
number them.

4 And it came to pass that I saw 
a  a mist  of  b darkness  on  the  face 
of the land of promise; and I saw 
lightnings, and I heard thunderings, 
and earthquakes, and all manner of 
tumultuous  noises;  and  I  saw  the 
earth and the rocks, that they rent; 
and I saw mountains tumbling into

pieces; and I saw the plains of the 
earth,  that  they  were  c broken  up; 
and I saw many cities that they were 
d sunk;  and  I  saw  many  that  they 
were  burned  with  fire;  and  I  saw 
many that did tumble to the earth, 
because of the quaking thereof.

5 And it came to pass after I saw 
these  things,  I  saw  the  a vapor  of 
darkness,  that  it  passed  from  off 
the face of the earth; and behold, I 
saw multitudes who had not fallen 
because  of  the  great  and  terrible 
judgments of the Lord.

6 And I saw the heavens open, and 
the  a Lamb of God descending out 
of heaven; and he came down and 
b showed himself unto them.

7 And I also saw and bear record 
that the Holy Ghost fell upon a twelve 
others; and they were ordained of 
God, and chosen.

8 And  the  angel  spake  unto  me, 
saying:  Behold  the  twelve  disci-
ples of the Lamb, who are chosen 
to minister unto thy seed.

9 And  he  said  unto  me:  Thou  
rememberest  the  a twelve  apostles 
of the Lamb? Behold they are they 
who shall b judge the twelve tribes 
of  Israel;  wherefore,  the  twelve  
ministers of thy seed shall be judged 
of them; for ye are of the house of  
Israel.

10 And  these  a twelve  ministers 
whom thou beholdest shall judge 
thy  seed.  And,  behold,  they  are 
righteous  forever;  for  because  of 
their faith in the Lamb of God their 
b garments  are  made  white  in  his  
blood.

11 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Look!  And  I  looked,  and  beheld 
a three  generations  pass  away  in
