13 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, the a Spirit of the Lord was 
upon  him,  and  he  said:  Helam,  I 
baptize  thee,  having  b authority 
from  the  Almighty  God,  as  a  tes-
timony  that  ye  have  entered  into 
a c covenant to serve him until you 
are dead as to the mortal body; and 
may the Spirit of the Lord be poured 
out  upon  you;  and  may  he  grant 
unto you eternal life, through the 
redemption of Christ, whom he has 
prepared from the  d foundation of  
the world.

and came forth out of the water re-
joicing, being filled with the Spirit.
15 And again, Alma took another, 
and went forth a second time into 
the  water,  and  baptized  him  ac-
cording to the first, only he did not 
bury a himself again in the water.

16 And after this manner he did 
baptize every one that went forth 
to the place of Mormon; and they 
were in number about two hundred 
and four souls; yea, and they were 
a baptized in the waters of Mormon, 
and  were  filled  with  the  b grace  
of God.

17 And they were called the church 
of  God,  or  the  a church  of  Christ, 
from that time forward. And it came 
to pass that whosoever was baptized 
by the power and authority of God 
was added to his church.
