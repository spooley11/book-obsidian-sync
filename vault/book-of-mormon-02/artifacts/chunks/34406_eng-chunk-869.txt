21 And it came to pass that a Amos 
died also, (and it was an hundred 
and ninety and four years from the 
coming of Christ) and his son Amos 
kept  the  record  in  his  stead;  and 
he also kept it upon the plates of 
Nephi; and it was also written in the 
book of Nephi, which is this book.
22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred  years  had  passed  away; 
and the second generation had all 
passed away save it were a few.

stance  no  more  a common  among 
them.

into classes; and they began to build 
up a churches unto themselves to get 
b gain, and began to deny the true 
church of Christ.
