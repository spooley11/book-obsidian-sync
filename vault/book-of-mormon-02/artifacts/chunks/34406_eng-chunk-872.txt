42 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
wicked  part  of  the  people  began 
again to build up the secret oaths 
and a combinations of Gadianton.

43 And also the people who were 
called the people of Nephi began to 
be proud in their hearts, because of

their exceeding riches, and become 
a vain like unto their brethren, the 
Lamanites.

44 And from this time the disci-
ples began to sorrow for the  a sins 
of the world.

45 And it came to pass that when 
three  hundred  years  had  passed 
away,  both  the  people  of  Nephi 
and  the  Lamanites  had  become 
exceedingly wicked one like unto  
another.

46 And it came to pass that the rob-
bers of a Gadianton did spread over 
all the face of the land; and there 
were none that were righteous save 
it were the disciples of Jesus. And 
gold and silver did they lay up in 
store in abundance, and did b traffic 
in all manner of traffic.

47 And it came to pass that after 
three hundred and five years had 
passed away, (and the people did 
still remain in wickedness) a Amos 
died;  and  his  brother,  Ammaron, 
did keep the record in his stead.

48 And it came to pass that when 
three  hundred  and  twenty  years 
had passed away, a Ammaron, being 
constrained by the Holy Ghost, did 
b hide up the  c records which were 
d sacred—yea,  even  all  the  sacred 
records  which  had  been  handed 
down from generation to generation, 
which were sacred—even until the 
three hundred and twentieth year 
from the coming of Christ.

49 And he did hide them up unto 
the  Lord,  that  they  might  a come 
again unto the remnant of the house 
of Jacob, according to the prophe-
cies and the promises of the Lord. 
And thus is the end of the record 
of Ammaron.
