yea, even after the order of his Son; 
and  this  that  it  should  be  shown 
unto  the  people,  a  great  many 
thousand years before his coming, 
that even redemption should come  
unto them.

19 And now I would that ye should 
know, that even since the days of 
Abraham  there  have  been  many 
prophets that have testified these 
things;  yea,  behold,  the  prophet 
a Zenos  did  testify  boldly;  for  the 
which he was slain.

20 And behold, also a Zenock, and 
also  b Ezias,  and  also  c Isaiah,  and 
d Jeremiah,  ( Jeremiah  being  that 
same prophet who testified of the 
destruction  of  e Jerusalem)  and 
now we know that Jerusalem was 
destroyed  according  to  the  words 
of  Jeremiah.  O  then  why  not  the 
Son of God come, according to his 
prophecy ?

21 And now will you dispute that 
a Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye 
say that the b sons of Zedekiah were 
not slain, all except it were c Mulek? 
Yea, and do ye not behold that the 
seed of Zedekiah are with us, and 
they  were  driven  out  of  the  land 
of  Jerusalem?  But  behold,  this  is 
not all—

22 Our  father  Lehi  was  driven  
out  of  Jerusalem  because  he  a tes-
tified  of  these  things.  Nephi  also  
testified  of  these  things,  and  also 
almost all of our fathers, even down 
to this time; yea, they have testified 
of the b coming of Christ, and have 
looked forward, and have rejoiced 
in his day which is to come.

23 And behold, he is God, and he

is a with them, and he did manifest 
himself unto them, that they were 
redeemed  by  him;  and  they  gave 
unto  him  glory,  because  of  that 
which is to come.
