and done as my father dwelt in a 
tent in the a valley which he called 
Lemuel.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, took one of the a daughters of  
Ishmael  to  b wife;  and  also,  my 
brethren took of the c daughters of 
Ishmael  to  wife;  and  also  d Zoram 
took the eldest daughter of Ishmael  
to wife.

8 And thus my father had fulfilled 
all the a commandments of the Lord 
which  had  been  given  unto  him. 
And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed 
of the Lord exceedingly.

9 And it came to pass that the voice 
of the Lord spake unto my father 
by night, and commanded him that 
on the morrow he should take his 
a journey into the wilderness.

10 And it came to pass that as my 
father  arose  in  the  morning,  and 
went forth to the tent door, to his 
great astonishment he beheld upon 
the ground a round a ball of curious 
workmanship;  and  it  was  of  fine 
brass. And within the ball were two 
spindles; and the one b pointed the 
way whither we should go into the 
wilderness.

11 And it came to pass that we did 
gather together whatsoever things 
we should carry into the wilderness, 
and all the remainder of our pro-
visions which the Lord had given 
unto us; and we did take  a seed of 
every kind that we might carry into 
the wilderness.
