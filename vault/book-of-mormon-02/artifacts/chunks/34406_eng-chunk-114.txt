17 My  heart  hath  been  weighed 
down  with  sorrow  from  time  to 
time, for I have feared, lest for the 
hardness  of  your  hearts  the  Lord 
your God should come out in the 
fulness of his a wrath upon you, that 
ye be b cut off and destroyed forever;
18 Or, that a a cursing should come 
upon  you  for  the  space  of  b many 
generations; and ye are visited by 
sword, and by famine, and are hated, 
and  are  led  according  to  the  will 
and captivity of the c devil.

19 O  my  sons,  that  these  things 
might not come upon you, but that 
ye might be a choice and a a favored 
people of the Lord. But behold, his 
will be done; for his b ways are righ-
teousness forever.

20 And  he  hath  said  that:  a Inas-

much  as  ye  shall  keep  my  b com-
mandments ye shall c prosper in the 
land; but inasmuch as ye will not 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be cut off from my presence.

21 And  now  that  my  soul  might 
have joy in you, and that my heart 
might leave this world with glad-
ness  because  of  you,  that  I  might 
not be brought down with grief and 
sorrow to the grave, arise from the 
dust, my sons, and be a men, and be 
determined in b one mind and in one 
heart, united in all things, that ye 
may not come down into captivity;
22 That ye may not be a cursed with 
a sore cursing; and also, that ye may 
not incur the displeasure of a b just 
God upon you, unto the destruction, 
yea, the eternal destruction of both 
soul and body.

23 Awake, my sons; put on the ar-
mor of a righteousness. Shake off the 
b chains with which ye are bound, 
and  come  forth  out  of  obscurity, 
and arise from the dust.

24 Rebel  no  more  against  your 
brother,  whose  views  have  been 
a glorious,  and  who  hath  kept  the 
commandments from the time that 
we  left  Jerusalem;  and  who  hath 
been an instrument in the hands of 
God, in bringing us forth into the 
land of promise; for were it not for 
him, we must have perished with 
b hunger  in  the  wilderness;  never-
theless, ye sought to c take away his
