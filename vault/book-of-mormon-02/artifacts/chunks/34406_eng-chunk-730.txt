24 And because I have done this, 
ye  say  that  I  have  agreed  with  a 
man that he should do this thing; 
yea, because I showed unto you this 
sign ye are angry with me, and seek 
to destroy my life.

25 And now behold, I will show 
unto you another sign, and see if 
ye  will  in  this  thing  seek  to  de-
stroy me.

26 Behold  I  say  unto  you:  Go  to 
the house of Seantum, who is the 
a brother of Seezoram, and say unto 
him—

27 Has  Nephi,  the  pretended 
prophet, who doth prophesy so much 
evil concerning this people, agreed 
with  thee,  in  the  which  ye  have 
murdered  Seezoram,  who  is  your  
brother?

28 And behold, he shall say unto

you, Nay.

29 And ye shall say unto him: Have

ye murdered your brother?

30 And he shall stand with fear, 
and wist not what to say. And be-
hold, he shall deny unto you; and 
he shall make as if he were aston-
ished; nevertheless, he shall declare 
unto you that he is innocent.

31 But  behold,  ye  shall  examine

him, and ye shall find blood upon 
the skirts of his cloak.

32 And  when  ye  have  seen  this, 
ye shall say: From whence cometh 
this blood? Do we not know that it 
is the blood of your brother?

us the thoughts of our hearts, and 
also  has  told  us  things;  and  even 
he  has  brought  unto  our  knowl-
edge the true murderer of our chief  
judge.

33 And then shall he tremble, and 
shall look pale, even as if death had 
come upon him.

34 And then shall ye say: Because 
of this fear and this paleness which 
has come upon your face, behold, 
we know that thou art guilty.

35 And  then  shall  greater  fear 
come upon him; and then shall he 
confess unto you, and deny no more 
that he has done this murder.
