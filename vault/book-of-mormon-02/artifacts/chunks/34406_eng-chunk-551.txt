3 Do  ye  remember  to  have  read 
what a Zenos, the prophet of old, has 
said concerning prayer or b worship?
4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O 
God, for thou hast heard my prayer, 
even when I was a in the wilderness; 
yea,  thou  wast  merciful  when  I 
prayed concerning those who were 
mine b enemies, and thou didst turn 
them to me.

5 Yea, O God, and thou wast mer-
ciful unto me when I did cry unto 
thee  in  my  a field;  when  I  did  cry 
unto  thee  in  my  prayer,  and  thou 
didst hear me.

6 And  again,  O  God,  when  I  did 
turn to my house thou didst hear 
me in my prayer.

7 And  when  I  did  turn  unto  my 
a closet,  O  Lord,  and  prayed  unto 
thee, thou didst hear me.

8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy 
children when they cry unto thee, 
to be heard of thee and not of men, 
and thou a wilt hear them.

9 Yea, O God, thou hast been mer-
ciful unto me, and heard my cries 
in the midst of thy congregations.

10 Yea, and thou hast also heard 
me when I have been a cast out and 
have  been  despised  by  mine  en-
emies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, 
and wast angry with mine enemies, 
and thou didst b visit them in thine 
anger with speedy destruction.
