2 And he was a just man, and he 
did walk uprightly before God; and 
he did observe to do good continu-
ally,  to  keep  the  commandments 
of the Lord his God; and also did 
his brother.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  a Mo-
roni died also. And thus ended the 
thirty and sixth year of the reign 
of the judges.

4 And it came to pass that in the 
thirty and seventh year of the reign 
of the judges, there was a large com-
pany of men, even to the amount 
of five thousand and four hundred 
men,  with  their  wives  and  their 
children, departed out of the land 
of Zarahemla into the land which 
was a northward.

5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, 
he  being  an  a exceedingly  curious 
man, therefore he went forth and 
built him an exceedingly large ship, 
on the borders of the land b Boun-
tiful, by the land Desolation, and 
launched it forth into the west sea, 
by the c narrow neck which led into 
the land northward.

6 And behold, there were many of 
the Nephites who did enter therein 
and did sail forth with much pro-
visions, and also many women and 
children; and they took their course 
northward.  And  thus  ended  the 
thirty and seventh year.

7 And in the thirty and eighth year, 
this  man  built  a other  ships.  And 
the first ship did also return, and

many more people did enter into 
it; and they also took much provi-
sions, and set out again to the land  
northward.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were never heard of more. And we 
suppose that they were drowned in 
the depths of the sea. And it came 
to pass that one other ship also did 
sail forth; and whither she did go 
we know not.

9 And it came to pass that in this 
year there were many people who 
went  forth  into  the  land  a north-
ward.  And  thus  ended  the  thirty 
and eighth year.
