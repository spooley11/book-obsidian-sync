15 Yet,  my  brethren,  I  have  not 
done  these  things  that  I  might 
a boast, neither do I tell these things 
that  thereby  I  might  accuse  you; 
but I tell you these things that ye 
may know that I can answer a clear 
b conscience before God this day.

16 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  that 
because I said unto you that I had 
spent my days in your service, I do 
not desire to boast, for I have only 
been in the service of God.

17 And  behold,  I  tell  you  these 
things that ye may learn a wisdom; 
that ye may learn that when ye are 
in the b service of your c fellow beings

MOSIAH 2  : 18–28

ye are only in the service of your  
God.

18 Behold, ye have called me your 
king; and if  I, whom ye call your king,  
do labor to a serve you, then ought 
not ye to labor to serve one another?
19 And  behold  also,  if  I,  whom 
ye  call  your  king,  who  has  spent 
his  days  in  your  service,  and  yet 
has been in the service of God, do 
merit any thanks from you, O how 
you ought to a thank your heavenly 
b King!

20 I say unto you, my brethren, that  
if you should render all the a thanks 
and b praise which your whole soul 
has power to possess, to that God 
who has created you, and has kept 
and c preserved you, and has caused 
that  ye  should  d rejoice,  and  has 
granted that ye should live in peace 
one with another—
