16 And he did exhort the people of  
Limhi and his brethren, all those that  
had been delivered out of bondage, 
that they should remember that it 
was the Lord that did deliver them.
17 And it came to pass that after 
Alma had taught the people many 
things,  and  had  made  an  end  of 
speaking to them, that king Limhi 
was  desirous  that  he  might  be 
baptized; and all his people were
