27 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr was exceedingly angry with 
Shared,  and  he  went  against  him 
with his armies to battle; and they 
did meet in great anger, and they 
did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and 
the battle became exceedingly sore.
28 And it came to pass that Shared 
fought  against  him  for  the  space 
of three days. And it came to pass 
that Coriantumr beat him, and did 
pursue  him  until  he  came  to  the 
plains of Heshlon.

29 And it came to pass that Shared 
gave  him  battle  again  upon  the 
plains;  and  behold,  he  did  beat 
Coriantumr,  and  drove  him  back 
again to the valley of Gilgal.

30 And  Coriantumr  gave  Shared 
battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in  
which he beat Shared and slew him.
31 And Shared wounded Corian-
tumr in his thigh, that he did not 
go to battle again for the space of 
two  years,  in  which  time  all  the 
people  upon  the  face  of  the  land 
were  shedding  blood,  and  there 
was none to restrain them.

unto that which was his own, with 
his  hands,  and  would  not  borrow 
neither would he lend; and every 
man kept the hilt of his sword in 
his right hand, in the  a defence of 
his property and his own life and 
of his wives and children.

3 And now, after the space of two 
years, and after the death of Shared, 
behold, there arose the brother of 
Shared  and  he  gave  battle  unto 
Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr 
did beat him and did pursue him 
to the wilderness of Akish.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother  of  Shared  did  give  battle 
unto him in the wilderness of Akish; 
and the battle became exceedingly 
sore, and many thousands fell by 
the sword.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Cori-
antumr did lay siege to the wilder-
ness; and the brother of Shared did 
march forth out of the wilderness by  
night, and slew a part of the army of 
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.
6 And he came forth to the land 
of a Moron, and placed himself upon 
the throne of Coriantumr.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Cori-
antumr dwelt with his army in the 
wilderness  for  the  space  of  two 
years, in which he did receive great 
strength to his army.
