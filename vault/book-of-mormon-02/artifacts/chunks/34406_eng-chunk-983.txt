people unto him, or their utter de-
struction; for I know that they must 
perish except they c repent and re-
turn unto him.

23 And if they perish it will be like 
unto the a Jaredites, because of the 
wilfulness of their hearts, b seeking 
for blood and c revenge.

24 And if it so be that they perish, 
we know that many of our brethren 
have a deserted over unto the Laman-
ites, and many more will also desert 
over  unto  them;  wherefore,  write 
somewhat a few things, if thou art 
spared and I shall perish and not 
see thee; but I trust that I may see 
thee soon; for I have sacred records 
that I would b deliver up unto thee.
25 My  son,  be  faithful  in  Christ; 
and may not the things which I have 
written grieve thee, to weigh thee 
down unto a death; but may Christ 
lift  thee  up,  and  may  his  suffer-
ings  and  death,  and  the  showing 
his body unto our fathers, and his 
mercy and b long-suffering, and the 
hope of his glory and of eternal life, 
rest in your c mind forever.

26 And may the grace of God the 
Father, whose throne is high in the 
heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who sitteth on the  a right hand of 
his  power,  until  all  things  shall 
become subject unto him, be, and 
abide with you forever. Amen.

The gifts of the Spirit are dispensed to 
the faithful—Spiritual gifts always ac-
company faith—Moroni’s words speak 
from the dust—Come unto Christ, be 
perfected  in  Him,  and  sanctify  your 
souls. About a.d. 421.
Now  I,  Moroni,  write  somewhat 
as  seemeth  me  good;  and  I  write 
unto my brethren, the a Lamanites; 
and I would that they should know 
that more than b four hundred and 
twenty years have passed away since 
the  sign  was  given  of  the  coming 
of Christ.

2 And  I  a seal  up  b these  records, 
after I have spoken a few words by 
way of exhortation unto you.
