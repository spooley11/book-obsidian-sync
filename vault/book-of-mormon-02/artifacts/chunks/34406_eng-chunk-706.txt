yea, remember that he cometh to

HELAMAN 5  : 10–21

378

10 And remember also the words 
which  Amulek  spake  unto  Zeez-
rom,  a in  the  city  of  Ammonihah; 
for he said unto him that the Lord 
surely should come to redeem his 
people, but that he should not come  
to redeem them in their sins, but to 
redeem them from their sins.

11 And he hath power given unto 
him  from  the  Father  to  redeem 
them from their sins because of re-
pentance; therefore he hath  a sent 
his  angels  to  declare  the  tidings 
of  the  conditions  of  repentance, 
which bringeth unto the power of 
the Redeemer, unto the salvation of  
their souls.

12 And now, my sons, remember, 
remember that it is upon the a rock 
of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the 
Son of God, that ye must build your 
b foundation;  that  when  the  devil 
shall send forth his mighty winds, 
yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, 
when  all  his  hail  and  his  mighty 
c storm shall beat upon you, it shall 
have no power over you to drag you 
down to the gulf of misery and end-
less wo, because of the rock upon 
which ye are built, which is a sure 
foundation, a foundation whereon 
if men build they cannot fall.
