10 Nevertheless,  a after  much 
b tribu lation, the Lord did hear my 
cries, and did answer my prayers, 
and  has  made  me  an  c instrument 
in his hands in bringing d so many 
of you to a knowledge of his truth.
11 Nevertheless,  in  this  I  do  not 
glory, for I am unworthy to glory 
of myself.

12 And now I say unto you, ye have 
been a oppressed by king Noah, and 
have been in bondage to him and his 
priests, and have been b brought into  
iniquity by them; therefore ye were 
bound with the c bands of iniquity.
13 And now as ye have been deliv-
ered by the power of God out of these

bonds; yea, even out of the a hands of 
king Noah and his people, and also 
from the b bonds of iniquity, even so 
I desire that ye should  c stand fast 
in this d liberty wherewith ye have 
been made free, and that ye trust 
e no man to be a king over you.

14 And also trust no one to be your  
a teacher nor your minister, except 
he be a man of God, walking in his 
ways  and  keeping  his  command-
ments.

15 Thus did Alma teach his peo-
ple,  that  every  man  should  a love 
his b neighbor c as himself, that there 
should  be  no  d contention  among 
them.

16 And now, Alma was their a high 
priest, he being the founder of their 
church.

17 And it came to pass that none 
received a authority to preach or to 
teach except it were by him from 
God. Therefore he b consecrated all 
their priests and all their teachers; 
and none were consecrated except 
they were just men.

18 Therefore they did watch over 
their people, and did a nourish them 
with  things  pertaining  to  righ-
teousness.

19 And it came to pass that they 
began  to  prosper  exceedingly  in 
the land; and they called the land 
a Helam.

20 And it came to pass that they 
did multiply and prosper exceed-
ingly in the land of Helam; and they 
built a city, which they called the 
city of Helam.
