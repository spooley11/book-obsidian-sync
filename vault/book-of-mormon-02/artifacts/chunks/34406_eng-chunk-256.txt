61 Wherefore, go to, and call a ser-
vants, that we may b labor diligently 
with our might in the vineyard, that 
we may c prepare the way, that I may 
bring forth again the natural fruit, 
which natural fruit is good and the 
most precious above all other fruit.
62 Wherefore, let us go to and la-
bor with our might this last time, 
for behold the end draweth nigh, 
and this is for the last time that I 
shall a prune my vineyard.

63 Graft in the branches; begin at 
the a last that they may be first, and 
that the first may be b last, and dig 
about the trees, both old and young, 
the first and the last; and the last 
and the first, that all may be nour-
ished once again for the last time.
64 Wherefore,  dig  about  them,

JACOB 5  : 65–75

and  prune  them,  and  dung  them 
once  more,  for  the  last  time,  for 
the end draweth nigh. And if it be 
so that these last grafts shall grow, 
and bring forth the natural fruit, 
then shall ye prepare the way for 
them, that they may grow.

65 And  as  they  begin  to  grow 
ye shall  a clear away the branches 
which bring forth bitter fruit, ac-
cording to the strength of the good 
and the size thereof; and ye shall 
not clear away the bad thereof all 
at once, lest the roots thereof should 
be too strong for the graft, and the 
graft thereof shall perish, and I lose 
the trees of my vineyard.
