12 And it came to pass that we did 
take our tents and depart into the 
wilderness, across the river Laman.
13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
traveled for the space of four days, 
nearly a south-southeast direction, 
and we did pitch our tents again; and 
we did call the name of the place  
a Shazer.

14 And it came to pass that we did 
take our bows and our arrows, and 
go forth into the wilderness to slay 
food for our families; and after we 
had slain food for our families we 
did  return  again  to  our  families 
in  the  wilderness,  to  the  place  of 
Shazer. And we did go forth again  
in  the  wilderness,  following  the 
same  direction,  keeping  in  the 
most fertile parts of the wilderness, 
which were in the borders near the 
a Red Sea.

15 And it came to pass that we did 
travel for the space of many days, 
a slaying food by the way, with our 
bows and our arrows and our stones 
and our slings.

16 And we did follow the a direc-
tions of the ball, which led us in the 
more fertile parts of the wilderness.
17 And after we had traveled for 
the space of many days, we did pitch 
our  tents  for  the  space  of  a  time, 
that we might again rest ourselves 
and obtain food for our families.

18 And it came to pass that as I, 
Nephi, went forth to slay food, be-
hold,  I  did  break  my  bow,  which 
was made of fine  a steel; and after 
I  did  break  my  bow,  behold,  my 
brethren were angry with me be-
cause of the loss of my bow, for we 
did obtain no food.

19 And it came to pass that we did 
return without food to our families, 
and being much fatigued, because 
of their journeying, they did suffer 
much for the want of food.

20 And it came to pass that Laman 
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael 
did begin to murmur exceedingly,  
because  of  their  sufferings  and 
afflictions  in  the  wilderness;  and 
also  my  father  began  to  murmur 
against the Lord his God; yea, and 
they were all exceedingly sorrowful,
