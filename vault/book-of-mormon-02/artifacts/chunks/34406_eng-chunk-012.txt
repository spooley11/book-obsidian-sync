In  or  about  the  year a.d. 421,  Moroni,  the  last  of  the  Nephite  prophet- 
historians, sealed the sacred record and hid it up unto the Lord, to be brought 
forth in the latter days, as predicted by the voice of God through His ancient 
prophets. In a.d. 1823, this same Moroni, then a resurrected personage, visited 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and subsequently delivered the engraved plates  
to him.

About this edition: The original title page, immediately preceding the contents  
page, is taken from the plates and is part of the sacred text. Introductions in 
a non-italic typeface, such as in 1 Nephi and immediately preceding Mosiah 
chapter 9, are also part of the sacred text. Introductions in italics, such as in 
chapter headings, are not original to the text but are study helps included for 
convenience in reading.

Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of 
the Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate  
to bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and 
early editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith.
