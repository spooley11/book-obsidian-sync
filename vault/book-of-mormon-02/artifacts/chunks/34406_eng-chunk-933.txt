14 And it came to pass that they 
all a sware unto him, by the God of 
heaven,  and  also  by  the  heavens, 
and also by the earth, and by their 
heads, that whoso should vary from 
the assistance which Akish desired 
should  lose  his  head;  and  whoso 
should  divulge  whatsoever  thing 
Akish made known unto them, the 
same should lose his life.

15 And it came to pass that thus 
they  did  agree  with  a Akish.  And  
Akish did administer unto them the 
oaths which were given by them of 
old who also sought power, which 
had been handed down even from 
b Cain,  who  was  a  murderer  from 
the beginning.

16 And they were kept up by the 
a power of the devil to administer 
these oaths unto the people, to keep 
them in darkness, to help such as

sought power to gain power, and to 
murder, and to plunder, and to lie, 
and to commit all manner of wick-
edness and whoredoms.

17 And  it  was  the  daughter  of 
Jared who put it into his heart to 
search up these things of old; and 
Jared put it into the heart of Akish; 
wherefore,  Akish  administered  it 
unto his kindred and friends, lead-
ing them away by fair promises to 
do whatsoever thing he desired.

18 And it came to pass that they 
formed a a secret combination, even 
as they of old; which combination is 
most abominable and wicked above 
all, in the sight of God;

19 For the Lord worketh not in se-
cret combinations, neither doth he 
will  that  man  should  shed  blood, 
but in all things hath forbidden it, 
from the beginning of man.

20 And now I, Moroni, do not write 
the manner of their oaths and com-
binations,  for  it  hath  been  made 
known unto me that they are had  
a among  all  people,  and  they  are  
had among the Lamanites.

21 And they have caused the a de-
struction of this people of whom I 
am now speaking, and also the de-
struction of the people of Nephi.
