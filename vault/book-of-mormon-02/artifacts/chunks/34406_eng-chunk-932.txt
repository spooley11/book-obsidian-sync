8 Now the daughter of Jared being 
exceedingly expert, and seeing the 
sorrows  of  her  father,  thought  to 
devise a plan whereby she could re-
deem the kingdom unto her father.
9 Now the daughter of Jared was 
exceedingly fair. And it came to pass 
that  she  did  talk  with  her  father, 
and said unto him: Whereby hath 
my  father  so  much  sorrow?  Hath 
he not read the a record which our 
fathers  brought  across  the  great 
deep? Behold, is there not an  b ac-
count concerning them of c old, that  
they  by  their  d secret  plans  did  
obtain kingdoms and great glory  ?
10 And  now,  therefore,  let  my 
father  send  for  Akish,  the  son  of

ETHER 8  : 11–23

Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and 
I will dance before him, and I will 
please him, that he will desire me 
to wife; wherefore if he shall desire 
of thee that ye shall give unto him 
me to wife, then shall ye say: I will 
give her if ye will bring unto me 
the a head of my father, the king.

11 And  now  Omer  was  a  friend 
to  Akish;  wherefore,  when  Jared 
had  sent  for  Akish,  the  daughter 
of  Jared  danced  before  him  that 
she pleased him, insomuch that he 
desired her to wife. And it came to 
pass that he said unto Jared: Give 
her unto me to wife.

12 And Jared said unto him: I will 
give her unto you, if ye will bring 
unto me the head of my father, the  
king.

13 And it came to pass that Akish  
gathered in unto the house of Jared 
all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: 
Will ye swear unto me that ye will 
be  faithful  unto  me  in  the  thing 
which I shall desire of you?
