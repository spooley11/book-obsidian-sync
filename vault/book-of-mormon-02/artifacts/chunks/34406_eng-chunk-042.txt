5 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded  me  to  make  these  plates 
for a a wise purpose in him, which 
purpose I know not.

6 But the Lord a knoweth all things 
from the beginning; wherefore, he 
prepareth a way to accomplish all 
his  works  among  the  children  of 
men; for behold, he hath all b power 
unto the fulfilling of all his words. 
And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

captive by the Babylonians—He tells of 
the coming among the Jews of a Mes-
siah, a Savior, a Redeemer—Lehi tells 
also of the coming of the one who should 
baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of 
the death and resurrection of the Mes-
siah—He compares the scattering and 
gathering  of  Israel  to  an  olive  tree—
Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, and of the need 
for righteousness. About 600–592 b.c.
And now I, Nephi, proceed to give 
an  account  upon  a these  plates  of 
my proceedings, and my reign and 
ministry; wherefore, to proceed with 
mine account, I must speak some-
what  of  the  things  of  my  father, 
and also of my brethren.

2 For behold, it came to pass af-
ter my father had made an end of 
speaking the words of his a dream, 
and also of exhorting  them to  all 
diligence, he spake unto them con-
cerning the Jews—
