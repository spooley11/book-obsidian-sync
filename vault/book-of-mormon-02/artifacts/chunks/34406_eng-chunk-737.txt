23 And in the seventy and ninth 
year there began to be much strife. 
But it came to pass that Nephi and 
Lehi, and many of their brethren 
who  knew  concerning  the  true 
points  of  doctrine,  having  many 
a revelations  daily,  therefore  they 
did preach unto the people, inso-
much that they did put an end to 
their strife in that same year.

24 And it came to pass that in the 
eightieth  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges  over  the  people  of  Nephi, 
there were a certain number of the 
dissenters from the people of Nephi, 
who  had  some  years  before  gone  
over unto the Lamanites, and taken 
upon  themselves  the  name  of  La-
manites, and also a certain number 
who were real descendants of the 
Lamanites, being stirred up to anger  
by  them,  or  by  those  dissenters, 
therefore they commenced a a war 
with their brethren.

25 And they did commit murder 
and plunder; and then they would 
retreat  back  into  the  mountains, 
and into the wilderness and secret 
places, hiding themselves that they 
could not be discovered, receiving 
daily an addition to their numbers, 
inasmuch as there were dissenters 
that went forth unto them.

26 And thus in time, yea, even in 
the space of a not many years, they 
became an exceedingly great band 
of robbers; and they did search out 
all the b secret plans of Gadianton; 
and  thus  they  became  robbers  of 
Gadianton.

27 Now behold, these robbers did 
make great havoc, yea, even great 
destruction  among  the  people  of 
Nephi, and also among the people 
of the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that it was 
expedient  that  there  should  be  a 
stop  put  to  this  work  of  destruc-
tion; therefore they sent an army 
of strong men into the wilderness 
and upon the mountains to search 
out  this  band  of  robbers,  and  to 
destroy them.
