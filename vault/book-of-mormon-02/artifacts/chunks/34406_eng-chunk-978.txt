14 Behold I say unto you, that he 
that supposeth that little children 
need baptism is in the gall of bitter-
ness and in the bonds of iniquity; 
for  he  hath  neither  a faith,  hope, 
nor charity; wherefore, should he 
be cut off while in the thought, he 
must go down to hell.

15 For awful is the wickedness to 
suppose that God saveth one child 
because of baptism, and the other 
must  perish  because  he  hath  no 
baptism.

16 Wo  be  unto  them  that  shall 
pervert the ways of the Lord after 
this manner, for they shall perish 
except they repent. Behold, I speak 
with  boldness,  having  a authority 
from God; and I fear not what man 
can  do;  for  b perfect  c love  d casteth 
out all fear.

17 And I am filled with a charity, 
which  is  everlasting  love;  where-
fore,  all  children  are  alike  unto 
me; wherefore, I love little children 
with a perfect love; and they are all 
alike and b partakers of salvation.

18 For  I  know  that  God  is  not  a 
partial God, neither a changeable 
being; but he is a unchangeable from 
b all eternity to all eternity.

19 Little a children cannot repent; 
wherefore, it is awful wickedness to 
deny the pure mercies of God unto

them, for they are all alive in him 
because of his b mercy.

20 And  he  that  saith  that  little 
children  need  baptism  denieth 
the mercies of Christ, and setteth 
at  naught  the  a atonement  of  him 
and the power of his redemption.

21 Wo unto such, for they are in 
danger of death, a hell, and an b end-
less torment. I speak it boldly; God 
hath commanded me. Listen unto 
them and give heed, or they stand 
against you at the  c judgment-seat 
of Christ.

22 For behold that all little chil-
dren are a alive in Christ, and also all 
they that are without the b law. For 
the power of   c redemption cometh on 
all them that have d no law; where-
fore, he that is not condemned, or 
he that is under no condemnation, 
cannot repent; and unto such bap-
tism availeth nothing—

23 But it is mockery before God, 
denying the mercies of Christ, and 
the  power  of  his  Holy  Spirit,  and 
putting trust in a dead works.
