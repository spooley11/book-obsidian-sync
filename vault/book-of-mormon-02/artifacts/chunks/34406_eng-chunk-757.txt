5 Telling  them  of  things  which 
must shortly come, that they might 
know and remember at the time of 
their  coming  that  they  had  been 
made known unto them beforehand, 
to the intent that they might believe; 
therefore as many as believed on the 
words  of  Samuel  went  forth  unto 
him to be baptized, for they came 
repenting and confessing their sins.
6 But the a more part of them did 
not believe in the words of Samuel; 
therefore when they saw that they 
could not hit him with their stones 
and their arrows, they cried unto 
their  captains,  saying:  b Take  this 
fellow  and  bind  him,  for  behold

he c hath a devil; and because of the 
power of the devil which is in him 
we cannot hit him with our stones 
and our arrows; therefore take him 
and bind him, and away with him.
7 And  as  they  went  forth  to  lay 
their hands on him, behold, he did 
cast  himself  down  from  the  wall, 
and did flee out of their lands, yea, 
even  unto  his  own  country,  and 
began  to  preach  and  to  prophesy 
a among his own people.

8 And behold, he was never heard 
of more among the Nephites; and 
thus were the affairs of the people.
9 And thus ended the eighty and 
sixth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

10 And thus ended also the eighty 
and seventh year of the reign of the 
judges, the more part of the people 
remaining in their pride and wick-
edness, and the lesser part walking 
more circumspectly before God.

11 And these were the conditions 
also, in the eighty and eighth year 
of the reign of the judges.

12 And there was but little altera-
tion  in  the  affairs  of  the  people, 
save it were the people began to be 
more hardened in iniquity, and do 
more and more of that which was 
a contrary to the commandments of 
God, in the eighty and ninth year 
of the reign of the judges.

13 But it came to pass in the nine-
tieth year of the reign of the judges, 
there were a great signs given unto 
the people, and wonders; and the 
words  of  the  prophets  b began  to 
be fulfilled.
