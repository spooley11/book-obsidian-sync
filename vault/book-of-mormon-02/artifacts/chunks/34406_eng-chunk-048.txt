11 And I said unto him: To know 
the  a interpretation  thereof—for  I 
spake  unto  him  as  a  man  speak-
eth; for I beheld that he was in the 
b form of a man; yet nevertheless, I 
knew that it was the Spirit of the 
Lord;  and  he  spake  unto  me  as  a 
man speaketh with another.

12 And it came to pass that he said 
unto me: Look! And I looked as if to  
look upon him, and I saw him not; for  
he had gone from before my presence.
13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I 
looked and beheld the great city of  
Jerusalem, and also other cities. And 
I beheld the city of Nazareth; and 
in the city of a Nazareth I beheld a 
b virgin,  and  she  was  exceedingly 
fair and white.

14 And it came to pass that I saw 
the  a heavens  open;  and  an  angel 
came  down  and  stood  before  me; 
and he said unto me: Nephi, what 
beholdest thou?

15 And I said unto him: A virgin, 
most  beautiful  and  fair  above  all 
other virgins.

16 And he said unto me: Knowest

thou the a condescension of God?

17 And  I  said  unto  him:  I  know 
that he loveth his children; never-
theless, I do not know the meaning 
of all things.

18 And he said unto me: Behold, 
the a virgin whom thou seest is the 
b mother of the Son of God, after the 
manner of the flesh.

19 And it came to pass that I be-
held that she was carried away in 
the Spirit; and after she had been 
carried away in the a Spirit for the 
space of a time the angel spake unto 
me, saying: Look!

20 And  I  looked  and  beheld  the 
virgin  again,  bearing  a  a child  in 
her arms.

21 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Behold the a Lamb of God, yea, even 
the  b Son  of  the  Eternal  c Father! 
Knowest thou the meaning of the 
d tree which thy father saw?

22 And  I  answered  him,  saying: 
Yea,  it  is  the  a love  of  God,  which 
b sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts 
of the children of men; wherefore, 
it is the  c most desirable above all  
things.

23 And he spake unto me, saying: 
Yea,  and  the  most  a joyous  to  the  
soul.
