Messengers  find  the  chief  judge  dead 
at the judgment seat—They are impris-
oned and later released—By inspiration 
Nephi identifies Seantum as the mur-
derer—Nephi is accepted by some as a 
prophet. About 23–21 b.c.

Behold, now it came to pass that 
when  Nephi  had  spoken  these 
words, certain men who were among 
them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, 
even  there  were  a five  who  went, 
and they said among themselves, as  
they went:

2 Behold, now we will know of a 
surety whether this man be a prophet  
and God hath commanded him to 
prophesy  such  marvelous  things 
unto us. Behold, we do not a believe  
that he hath; yea, we do not believe 
that he is a prophet; nevertheless, 
if this thing which he has said con-
cerning the chief judge be true, that 
he  be  dead,  then  will  we  believe 
that the other words which he has 
spoken are true.

3 And it came to pass that they ran 
in  their  might,  and  came  in  unto 
the judgment-seat; and behold, the 
chief judge had fallen to the earth, 
and did a lie in his blood.

4 And now behold, when they saw 
this they were astonished exceed-
ingly,  insomuch  that  they  fell  to 
the earth; for they had not believed 
the words which Nephi had spoken 
concerning the chief judge.

5 But  now,  when  they  saw  they 
believed, and fear came upon them 
lest all the judgments which Nephi 
had spoken a should come upon the 
people; therefore they did quake, 
and had fallen to the earth.

6 Now,  immediately  when  the 
judge had been murdered—he being 
stabbed by his brother by a garb of 
secrecy, and he fled, and the servants  
ran and told the people, raising the 
cry of murder among them;

7 And behold the people did gather

themselves together unto the place 
of the judgment-seat—and behold, 
to  their  astonishment  they  saw 
those a five men who had fallen to 
the earth.

8 And  now  behold,  the  people 
knew nothing concerning the mul-
titude who had gathered together 
at the a garden of Nephi; therefore 
they said among themselves: These 
men are they who have murdered 
the judge, and God has smitten them 
that they could not flee from us.
