19 Now  Zerahemnah,  when  he 
saw  that  they  were  all  about  to 
be destroyed, cried mightily unto 
Moroni,  promising  that  he  would 
covenant and also his people with 
them,  if  they would  spare the re-
mainder  of  their  lives,  that  they

a never  would  come  to  war  again  
against them.

20 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused that the work of death should 
a cease again among the people. And 
he took the weapons of war from 
the Lamanites; and after they had 
entered into a b covenant with him 
of peace they were suffered to de-
part into the wilderness.

21 Now the number of their dead 
was not numbered because of the 
greatness of the number; yea, the 
number of their dead was exceed-
ingly great, both on the Nephites 
and on the Lamanites.

22 And it came to pass that they 
did cast their dead into the waters 
of Sidon, and they have gone forth 
and  are  buried  in  the  depths  of  
the a sea.

23 And the armies of the Nephites, 
or of Moroni, returned and came to 
their houses and their lands.

24 And thus ended the eighteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi. And thus ended 
the record of Alma, which was writ-
ten upon the plates of Nephi.

The account of the people of Nephi, 
and their wars and dissensions, in 
the days of Helaman, according to 
the  record  of  Helaman,  which  he 
kept in his days.

Comprising chapters 45 through 62.

CHAPTER 45

Helaman believes the words of Alma—
Alma prophesies the destruction of the 
Nephites—He  blesses  and  curses  the 
land—Alma may have been taken up 
by the Spirit, even as Moses—Dissen-
sion grows in the Church. About 73 b.c.
Behold, now it came to pass that the

people of Nephi were exceedingly 
rejoiced, because the Lord had again 
a delivered them out of the hands of 
their enemies; therefore they gave 
thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, 
and they did b fast much and pray 
much,  and  they  did  worship  God 
with exceedingly great joy.
