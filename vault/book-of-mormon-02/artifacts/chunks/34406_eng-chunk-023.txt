15 But  behold  I  said  unto  them 
that: a As the Lord liveth, and as we  
live, we will not go down unto our 
father  in  the  wilderness  until  we 
have b accomplished the thing which 
the Lord hath commanded us.

16 Wherefore,  let  us  be  faithful 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord; therefore let us go down 
to the land of our father’s a inheri-
tance, for behold he left gold and 
silver,  and  all  manner  of  riches. 
And all this he hath done because 
of the b commandments of the Lord.
17 For  he  knew  that  Jerusalem 
must be a destroyed, because of the 
wickedness of the people.

18 For behold, they have a rejected 
the words of the prophets. Where-
fore, if my father should dwell in the 
land after he hath been b commanded  
to flee out of the land, behold, he 
would  also  perish.  Wherefore,  it 
must needs be that he flee out of 
the land.

19 And  behold,  it  is  wisdom  in  
God  that  we  should  obtain  these 
a records,  that  we  may  preserve 
unto our children the language of 
our fathers;

20 And also that we may a preserve  
unto  them  the  words  which  have 
been  spoken  by  the  mouth  of  all 
the  holy  b prophets,  which  have 
been  delivered  unto  them  by  the 
Spirit and power of God, since the 
world began, even down unto this 
present time.
