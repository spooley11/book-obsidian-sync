16 And I did endeavor to preach 
unto  this  people,  but  my  mouth 
was shut, and I was forbidden that 
I should preach unto them; for be-
hold  they  had  a wilfully  rebelled 
against their God; and the beloved 
disciples were  b taken away out of 
the land, because of their iniquity.
17 But I did remain among them, 
but I was forbidden to a preach unto 
them,  because  of  the  hardness  of 
their  hearts;  and  because  of  the 
hardness  of  their  hearts  the  land 
was b cursed for their sake.

18 And these Gadianton robbers, 
who were among the Lamanites, did 
infest the land, insomuch that the 
inhabitants thereof began to a hide 
up their b treasures in the earth; and 
they became slippery, because the 
Lord had cursed the land, that they 
could  not  hold  them,  nor  retain 
them again.

19 And it came to pass that there 
were  a sorceries,  and  witchcrafts, 
and magics; and the power of the 
evil one was wrought upon all the 
face of the land, even unto the ful-
filling of all the words of Abinadi, 
and also b Samuel the Lamanite.

CHAPTER 2
Mormon  leads  the  Nephite  armies—
Blood and carnage sweep the land—The 
Nephites lament and mourn with the 
sorrowing  of  the  damned—Their  day

of  grace  is  passed—Mormon  obtains 
the  plates  of  Nephi—Wars  continue. 
About a.d. 327–50.
And  it  came  to  pass  in  that  same 
year there began to be a war again 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites.  And  notwithstanding  I 
being  a young,  was  large  in  stat-
ure; therefore the people of Nephi 
appointed  me  that  I  should  be 
their leader, or the leader of their  
armies.

2 Therefore it came to pass that in 
my sixteenth year I did go forth at 
the head of an army of the Neph-
ites, against the Lamanites; there-
fore three hundred and twenty and 
six years had passed away.

3 And it came to pass that in the 
three  hundred  and  twenty  and 
seventh  year  the  Lamanites  did 
come  upon  us  with  a exceedingly 
great  power,  insomuch  that  they 
did frighten my armies; therefore 
they would not fight, and they be-
gan  to  retreat  towards  the  b north  
countries.
