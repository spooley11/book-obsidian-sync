CHAPTER 40
Christ brings to pass the resurrection 
of all men—The righteous dead go to 
paradise and the wicked to outer dark-
ness  to  await  the  day  of  their  resur-
rection—All things will be restored to 
their  proper  and  perfect  frame  in  the 
Resurrection. About 74 b.c.
Now my son, here is somewhat more 
I would say unto thee; for I perceive

that thy mind is worried concern-
ing the resurrection of the dead.

2 Behold, I say unto you, that there 
is no resurrection—or, I would say, 
in  other  words,  that  this  mortal 
does not put on a immortality, this 
corruption does not b put on incor-
ruption—c until after the coming of  
Christ.

3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the 
a resurrection of the dead. But be-
hold, my son, the resurrection is not 
yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mys-
tery; nevertheless, there are many 
b mysteries which are c kept, that no 
one knoweth them save God him-
self. But I show unto you one thing 
which  I  have  inquired  diligently 
of God that I might know—that is 
concerning the resurrection.

4 Behold, there is a time appointed 
that all shall a come forth from the 
dead. Now when this time cometh 
no one knows; but God knoweth the 
time which is appointed.

5 Now, whether there shall be one 
time, or a a second time, or a third 
time,  that  men  shall  come  forth 
from  the  dead,  it  mattereth  not; 
for God b knoweth all these things; 
and  it  sufficeth  me  to  know  that 
this is the case—that there is a time 
appointed that all shall rise from  
the dead.

6 Now there must needs be a space 
betwixt the time of death and the 
time of the resurrection.

7 And now I would inquire what 
becometh of the a souls of men b from 
this time of death to the time ap-
pointed for the resurrection?

8 Now whether there is more than 
one a time appointed for men to rise 
it mattereth not; for all do not die at 
once, and this mattereth not; all is
