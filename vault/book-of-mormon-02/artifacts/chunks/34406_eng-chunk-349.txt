5 Now,  there  was  in  Mormon  a 
fountain of pure water, and Alma 
resorted thither, there being near 
the water a thicket of small trees, 
where he did hide himself in the 
daytime  from  the  searches  of  the 
king.

6 And it came to pass that as many 
as  believed  him  went  thither  to 
hear his words.

7 And it came to pass after many 
days there were a goodly number 
gathered  together  at  the  place  of 
Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. 
Yea, all were gathered together that 
believed on his word, to hear him. 
And  he  did  a teach  them,  and  did 
preach unto them repentance, and 
redemption, and faith on the Lord.
8 And it came to pass that he said 
unto them: Behold, here are the wa-
ters of Mormon (for thus were they 
called) and now, as ye are a desirous 
to come into the b fold of God, and 
to be called his people, and are will-
ing to bear one another’s burdens, 
that they may be light;

9 Yea, and are a willing to mourn 
with  those  that  b mourn;  yea,  and

comfort those that stand in need of 
comfort, and to stand as c witnesses 
of God at all times and in all things, 
and in all places that ye may be in, 
even until death, that ye may be re-
deemed of God, and be numbered 
with those of the d first resurrection, 
that ye may have eternal life—

10 Now I say unto you, if this be 
the desire of your hearts, what have 
you against being a baptized in the 
b name of the Lord, as a witness be-
fore him that ye have entered into 
a c covenant with him, that ye will 
serve him and keep his command-
ments,  that  he  may  pour  out  his 
Spirit more abundantly upon you?
11 And now when the people had 
heard  these  words,  they  clapped 
their hands for joy, and exclaimed: 
This is the desire of our hearts.

12 And now it came to pass that 
Alma took Helam, he being one of 
the first, and went and stood forth 
in the water, and cried, saying: O 
Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy 
servant, that he may do this work 
with holiness of heart.
