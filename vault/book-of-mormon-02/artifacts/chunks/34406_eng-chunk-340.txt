4 And they are a one God, yea, the 
very b Eternal c Father of heaven and 
of earth.

5 And  thus  the  flesh  becoming 
subject to the Spirit, or the Son to 
the Father, being one God, a suffer-
eth temptation, and yieldeth not to 
the temptation, but suffereth him-
self to be mocked, and  b scourged, 
and cast out, and disowned by his  
c people.

6 And after all this, after working 
many mighty miracles among the 
children  of  men,  he  shall  be  led, 
yea, even a as Isaiah said, as a sheep 
before the shearer is dumb, so he 
b opened not his mouth.

7 Yea, even so he shall be led, a cru-
cified, and slain, the b flesh becom-
ing  subject  even  unto  death,  the 
c will  of  the  Son  being  swallowed 
up in the will of the Father.

8 And  thus  God  breaketh  the 
a bands of death, having gained the 
b victory over death; giving the Son 
power to make c intercession for the 
children of men—

9 Having  ascended  into  heaven, 
having the bowels of mercy; being 
filled with compassion towards the 
children of men; standing betwixt 
them  and  justice;  having  broken 
the  bands  of  death,  taken  upon 
a himself  their  iniquity  and  their 
transgressions,  having  redeemed 
them, and b satisfied the demands of  
justice.

10 And now I say unto you, who 
shall  declare  his  a generation?  Be-
hold, I say unto you, that when his 
soul  has  been  made  an  offering 
for b sin he shall see his c seed. And 
now  what  say  ye?  And  who  shall 
be his seed?

11 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  that 
whosoever  has  heard  the  words 
of the  a prophets, yea, all the holy  
prophets who have prophesied con-
cerning the coming of the Lord—I 
say unto you, that all those who have 
hearkened unto their words, and be-
lieved that the Lord would redeem 
his people, and have looked forward 
to that day for a remission of their 
sins, I say unto you, that these are 
his  seed,  or  they  are  the  heirs  of  
the b kingdom of God.

12 For these are they whose sins 
a he  has  borne;  these  are  they  for 
whom he has died, to redeem them 
from their transgressions. And now, 
are they not his seed?
