CHAPTER 41
In the Resurrection men come forth to 
a state of endless happiness or endless 
misery—Wickedness never was happi-
ness—Carnal men are without God in 
the world—Every person receives again 
in  the  Restoration  the  characteristics 
and  attributes  acquired  in  mortality.

And now, my son, I have somewhat 
to say concerning the restoration of 
which has been spoken; for behold, 
some have a wrested the scriptures, 
and have gone far b astray because 
of this thing. And I perceive that 
thy  mind  has  been  c worried  also 
concerning this thing. But behold, 
I will explain it unto thee.

2 I say unto thee, my son, that the 
plan of restoration is requisite with 
the justice of God; for it is requisite 
that all things should be restored 
to their proper order. Behold, it is 
requisite and just, according to the 
power and resurrection of Christ,

that the soul of man should be re-
stored to its body, and that every 
a part of the body should be restored 
to itself.

3 And it is requisite with the a jus-
tice  of  God  that  men  should  be 
b judged according to their c works; 
and if their works were good in this 
life, and the desires of their hearts 
were good, that they should also, at 
the last day, be d restored unto that 
which is good.
