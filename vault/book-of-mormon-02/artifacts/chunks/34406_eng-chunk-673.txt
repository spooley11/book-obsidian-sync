11 Behold, could ye suppose that 
ye could sit upon your thrones, and 
because of the exceeding goodness 
of God ye could do nothing and he 
would  deliver  you?  Behold,  if  ye 
have  supposed  this  ye  have  sup-
posed in vain.

12 Do ye a suppose that, because so 
many of your brethren have been 
killed it is because of their wicked-
ness? I say unto you, if ye have sup-
posed this ye have supposed in vain; 
for I say unto you, there are many 
who have fallen by the sword; and 
behold it is to your condemnation;
13 For  the  Lord  suffereth  the 
a righteous to be slain that his jus-
tice and b judgment may come upon 
the wicked; therefore ye need not 
suppose that the righteous are lost 
because they are slain; but behold, 
they do enter into the rest of the 
Lord their God.

14 And  now  behold,  I  say  unto  
you,  I  fear  exceedingly  that  the  
judgments of God will come upon 
this  people,  because  of  their  ex-
ceeding a slothfulness, yea, even the

slothfulness of our government, and 
their exceedingly great neglect to-
wards their brethren, yea, towards 
those who have been slain.

15 For  were  it  not  for  the  wick-
edness which first commenced at 
our head, we a could have withstood 
our enemies that they could have 
gained no power over us.

16 Yea, had it not been for the war 
which broke out a among ourselves; 
yea, were it not for these b king-men, 
who  caused  so  much  bloodshed 
among ourselves; yea, at the time we 
were contending among ourselves, 
if we had united our strength as we 
hitherto have done; yea, had it not 
been for the desire of power and au-
thority which those king-men had 
over us; had they been true to the 
cause of our freedom, and united 
with us, and gone forth against our 
enemies, instead of taking up their 
swords  against  us,  which  was  the 
cause of so much bloodshed among 
ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth 
against them in the strength of the 
Lord, we should have dispersed our 
enemies,  for  it  would  have  been 
done,  according  to  the  c fulfilling 
of his word.
