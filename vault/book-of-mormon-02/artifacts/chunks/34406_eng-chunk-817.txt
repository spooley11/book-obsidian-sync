23 And  they  understood  me  not 
that I said they shall hear my voice; 
and  they  understood  me  not  that 
the a Gentiles should not at any time 
hear  my  voice—that  I  should  not 
manifest myself unto them save it 
were by the b Holy Ghost.

24 But behold, ye have both heard 
a my voice, and seen me; and ye are 
my  sheep,  and  ye  are  numbered 
among those whom the Father hath 
b given me.

CHAPTER 16

Jesus will visit others of the lost sheep 
of Israel—In the latter days the gospel 
will go to the Gentiles and then to the 
house of Israel—The Lord’s people will 
see  eye  to  eye  when  He  brings  again 
Zion. About a.d. 34.
And  verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  you 
that I have a other sheep, which are 
not of this land, neither of the land

of Jerusalem, neither in any parts 
of that land round about whither 
I have been to minister.

2 For  they  of  whom  I  speak  are 
they who have not as yet heard my 
voice;  neither  have  I  at  any  time 
manifested myself unto them.

3 But I have received a a command-
ment of the Father that I shall go 
unto them, and that they shall b hear 
my voice, and shall be numbered 
among my sheep, that there may be 
one fold and one shepherd; there-
fore I go to show myself unto them.
4 And I command you that ye shall 
a write these sayings after I am gone, 
that  if  it  so  be  that  my  people  at 
Jerusalem, they who have seen me 
and been with me in my ministry, 
do not ask the Father in my name, 
that they may receive a knowledge 
of you by the Holy Ghost, and also 
of the other tribes whom they know 
not of, that these sayings which ye 
shall write shall be kept and shall 
be manifested unto the  b Gentiles, 
that through the fulness of the Gen-
tiles, the remnant of their seed, who 
shall  be  scattered  forth  upon  the 
face of the earth because of their 
c unbelief,  may  be  brought  in,  or 
may  be  brought  to  a  d knowledge 
of me, their Redeemer.
