which  thou  hast  spoken  unto  us; 
and also, we know of their surety 
and truth, because of the Spirit of 
the  Lord  Omnipotent,  which  has 
wrought  a  mighty  a change  in  us, 
or  in  our  hearts,  that  we  have  no 
more disposition to do b evil, but to 
do good continually.

3 And we, ourselves, also, through 
the infinite a goodness of God, and 
the  manifestations  of  his  Spirit,

torment, as has been spoken by the 
c angel, that we may not drink out 
of the cup of the wrath of God.
