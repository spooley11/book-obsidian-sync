13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let 
us retain our swords that they be 
not stained with the blood of our 
brethren; for perhaps, if we should 
stain our swords a again they can no 
more  be  b washed  bright  through 
the blood of the Son of our great 
God,  which  shall  be  shed  for  the 
atonement of our sins.

14 And  the  great  God  has  had 
mercy on us, and made these things

known unto us that we might not 
perish; yea, and he has made these 
things known unto us beforehand, 
because he loveth our a souls as well 
as he loveth our children; therefore, 
in his mercy he doth visit us by his 
angels, that the b plan of salvation 
might be made known unto us as 
well as unto future generations.

15 Oh, how merciful is our God! 
And now behold, since it has been 
as much as we could do to get our 
stains taken away from us, and our 
swords are made bright, let us a hide 
them away that they may be kept 
bright, as a testimony to our God at  
the last day, or at the day that we 
shall  be  brought  to  stand  before 
him to be judged, that we have not 
stained our swords in the blood of 
our  brethren  since  he  imparted 
his word unto us and has made us 
b clean thereby.

16 And now, my brethren, if our 
brethren seek to destroy us, behold, 
we will hide away our swords, yea, 
even we will bury them deep in the 
earth, that they may be kept bright, 
as a testimony that we have never 
used them, at the last day; and if 
our  brethren  destroy  us,  behold, 
we shall  a go to our God and shall  
be saved.

17 And now it came to pass that 
when the king had made an end of 
these  sayings,  and  all  the  people 
were assembled together, they took 
their swords, and all the weapons 
which were used for the shedding 
of man’s blood, and they did a bury 
them up deep in the earth.
