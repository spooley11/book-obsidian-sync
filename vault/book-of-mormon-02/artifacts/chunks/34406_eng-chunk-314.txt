they  would  not  hearken  unto  his 
words; but there arose contentions 
among them, even so much that they 
did shed blood among themselves.
26 And a a prophet of the Lord have 
they b slain; yea, a chosen man of God,  
who told them of their wickedness 
and abominations, and prophesied 
of many things which are to come, 
yea, even the coming of Christ.

27 And because he said unto them 
that Christ was the a God, the Father 
of all things, and said that he should 
take upon him the b image of man, 
and  it  should  be  the  c image  after 
which man was created in the be-
ginning; or in other words, he said 
that man was created after the im-
age of  d God, and that God should 
come down among the children of 
men, and take upon him flesh and 
blood, and go forth upon the face 
of the earth—

28 And now, because he said this, 
they  did  a put  him  to  death;  and 
many  more  things  did  they  do 
which brought down the wrath of 
God  upon  them.  Therefore,  who 
wondereth that they are in bond-
age, and that they are smitten with 
sore afflictions?

29 For behold, the Lord hath said: 
I will not a succor my people in the 
day  of  their  transgression;  but  I 
will hedge up their ways that they 
prosper not; and their doings shall 
be  as  a  b stumbling  block  before  
them.

30 And again, he saith: If my people  
shall sow a filthiness they shall b reap 
the c chaff thereof in the whirlwind; 
and the effect thereof is poison.

31 And  again  he  saith:  If  my

people  shall  sow  filthiness  they 
shall  reap  the  a east  wind,  which 
bringeth immediate destruction.

32 And now, behold, the promise 
of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are 
smitten and afflicted.

33 But if ye will a turn to the Lord 
with full purpose of heart, and put 
your  trust  in  him,  and  serve  him 
with all b diligence of mind, if ye do 
this, he will, according to his own 
will and pleasure, deliver you out 
of bondage.
