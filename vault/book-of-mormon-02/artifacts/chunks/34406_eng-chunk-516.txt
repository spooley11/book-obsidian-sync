3 Behold,  I  answer  for  you;  for 
our brethren, the Lamanites, were 
in darkness, yea, even in the dark-
est abyss, but behold, how  a many 
of them are brought to behold the 
marvelous light of God! And this is 
the blessing which hath been be-
stowed upon us, that we have been 
made  b instruments  in  the  hands 
of  God  to  bring  about  this  great  
work.

4 Behold, a thousands of them do 
rejoice, and have been brought into 
the fold of God.

5 Behold, the a field was ripe, and 
blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in 
the b sickle, and did reap with your 
might, yea, all the day long did ye 
labor;  and  behold  the  number  of 
your  c sheaves!  And  they  shall  be

gathered into the garners, that they 
are not wasted.

6 Yea,  they  shall  not  be  beaten 
down by the storm at the last day; 
yea, neither shall they be harrowed 
up by the whirlwinds; but when the 
a storm cometh they shall be gath-
ered  together  in  their  place,  that 
the storm cannot penetrate to them; 
yea,  neither  shall  they  be  driven 
with  fierce  winds  whithersoever 
the enemy listeth to carry them.

7 But behold, they are in the hands 
of the Lord of the a harvest, and they 
are his; and he will b raise them up 
at the last day.
