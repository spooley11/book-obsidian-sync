may repent and come unto me and 
be baptized in my name and know 
of the true points of my doctrine, 
that they may be b numbered among 
my people, O house of Israel;

7 And  when  these  things  come  
to pass that thy a seed shall begin to  
know  these  things—it  shall  be  a 
sign unto them, that they may know  
that the work of the Father hath al-
ready commenced unto the fulfill-
ing of the covenant which he hath 
made unto the people who are of 
the house of Israel.

8 And when that day shall come, it 
shall come to pass that kings shall 
shut their mouths; for that which 
had not been told them shall they 
see;  and  that  which  they  had  not 
heard shall they a consider.

9 For in that day, for my sake shall 
the  Father  a work  a  work,  which 
shall be a great and a  b marvelous 
c work among them; and there shall 
be among them those who will not 
believe it, although a man shall de-
clare it unto them.

10 But behold, the life of my ser-
vant shall be in my hand; therefore 
they shall not hurt him, although he 
shall be a marred because of them.  
Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto  
them  that  b my  wisdom  is  greater 
than the cunning of the devil.
