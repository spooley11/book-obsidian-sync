6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more 
part  of  them  are  doing  this,  and 
they are striving with a unwearied 
diligence that they may bring the 
remainder of their brethren to the 
knowledge of the truth; therefore 
there are many who do add to their 
numbers daily.

7 And behold, ye do know of your-
selves, for ye have witnessed it, that 
as many of them as are brought to 
the knowledge of the truth, and to 
know of the wicked and abominable 
traditions of their fathers, and are 
led to believe the holy scriptures, 
yea,  the  prophecies  of  the  holy 
prophets, which are written, which

and unto repentance, which faith 
and repentance bringeth a a change 
of heart unto them—
