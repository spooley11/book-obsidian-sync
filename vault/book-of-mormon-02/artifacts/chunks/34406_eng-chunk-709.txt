30 And it came to pass when they 
heard this a voice, and beheld that 
it was not a voice of thunder, nei-
ther  was  it  a  voice  of  a  great  tu-
multuous noise, but behold, it was 
a  b still  voice  of  perfect  mildness, 
as if it had been a whisper, and it 
did pierce even to the very soul—
31 And notwithstanding the mild-
ness of the voice, behold the earth 
shook exceedingly, and the walls of 
the prison trembled again, as if it 
were about to tumble to the earth; 
and behold the cloud of darkness, 
which had overshadowed them, did 
not disperse—

32 And  behold  the  voice  came 
again,  saying:  a Repent  ye,  repent 
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand; and seek no more to destroy 
my servants. And it came to pass 
that the earth shook again, and the 
walls trembled.

33 And also again the third time the 
voice came, and did speak unto them 
marvelous words which a cannot be 
uttered by man; and the walls did 
tremble again, and the earth shook  
as if it were about to divide asunder.
34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites could not flee because 
of the cloud of darkness which did 
overshadow them; yea, and also they 
were immovable because of the fear 
which did come upon them.

35 Now there was one among them 
who was a Nephite by birth, who 
had once belonged to the church of 
God but had dissented from them.
36 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
turned him about, and behold, he 
saw through the cloud of darkness 
the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and be-
hold, they did a shine exceedingly,
