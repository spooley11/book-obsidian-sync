4 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard went forth, and 
he saw that his olive tree began to 
decay;  and  he  said:  I  will  a prune 
it,  and  dig  about  it,  and  nourish 
it, that perhaps it may shoot forth 
young and tender branches, and it 
perish not.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
a pruned it, and digged about it, and 
nourished it according to his word.
6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
many  days  it  began  to  put  forth 
somewhat a little, young and tender 
branches; but behold, the main a top 
thereof began to perish.

7 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard saw it, and he 
said unto his a servant: It grieveth me 
that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, go and pluck the branches from 
a b wild olive tree, and bring them 
hither unto me; and we will pluck 
off those main branches which are 
beginning to wither away, and we 
will  cast  them  into  the  fire  that 
they may be burned.

8 And  behold,  saith  the  Lord  of 
the vineyard, I take a away many of 
these young and tender branches, 
and  I  will  graft  them  b whitherso-
ever I will; and it mattereth not that

if it so be that the root of this tree 
will perish, I may preserve the fruit 
thereof  unto  myself;  wherefore,  I 
will  take  these  young  and  tender 
branches,  and  I  will  graft  them 
whithersoever I will.

9 Take  thou  the  branches  of  the 
wild olive tree, and graft them in, in 
the a stead thereof; and these which 
I have plucked off I will cast into 
the fire and burn them, that they 
may not cumber the ground of my 
vineyard.

10 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servant  of  the  Lord  of  the  vine-
yard  did  according  to  the  word 
of  the  Lord  of  the  vineyard,  and 
grafted in the branches of the a wild  
olive tree.
