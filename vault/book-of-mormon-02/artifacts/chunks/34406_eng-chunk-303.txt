14 And  ye  will  not  suffer  your 
a children  that  they  go  hungry,  or 
naked; neither will ye b suffer that 
they transgress the laws of God, and 
fight and c quarrel one with another, 
and serve the devil, who is the mas-
ter of sin, or who is the d evil spirit 
which hath been spoken of by our 
fathers, he being an enemy to all 
righteousness.

15 But ye will a teach them to b walk 
in the ways of truth and c soberness; 
ye will teach them to d love one an-
other, and to serve one another.

16 And  also,  ye  yourselves  will 
a succor those that stand in need of  
your  succor;  ye  will  administer  
of  your  substance  unto  him  that 
standeth in need; and ye will not 
suffer that the b beggar putteth up 
his petition to you in vain, and turn 
him out to perish.

17 Perhaps  thou  shalt  a say:  The 
man has brought upon himself his 
misery;  therefore  I  will  stay  my 
hand, and will not give unto him 
of my food, nor impart unto him of 
my substance that he may not suf-
fer, for his punishments are just—
18 But  I  say  unto  you,  O  man, 
whosoever doeth this the same hath 
great  cause  to  repent;  and  except 
he repenteth of that which he hath 
done he perisheth forever, and hath 
no interest in the kingdom of God.
19 For behold, are we not all a beg-
gars?  Do  we  not  all  depend  upon 
the same Being, even God, for all 
the substance which we have, for 
both food and raiment, and for gold,

and for silver, and for all the riches 
which we have of every kind?
