among  the  people  of  the  b church 
of  Christ;  and  their  c names  were 
taken, that they might be remem-
bered and nourished by the good 
word of God, to keep them in the 
right  way,  to  keep  them  continu-
ally d watchful unto prayer, e relying 
alone  upon  the  merits  of  Christ, 
who was the author and the finisher  
of their faith.

5 And  the  a church  did  meet  to-
gether b oft, to c fast and to pray, and 
to speak one with another concern-
ing the welfare of their souls.

6 And  they  did  a meet  together 
oft to partake of bread and wine, 
in  b remembrance  of  the  Lord  
Jesus.

7 And they were strict to observe 
that  there  should  be  a no  iniquity 
among them; and whoso was found 
to commit iniquity, and b three wit-
nesses of the church did condemn 
them before the c elders, and if they 
repented  not,  and  d confessed  not, 
their names were e blotted out, and 
they  were  not  f numbered  among 
the people of Christ.

8 But a as oft as they repented and 
sought forgiveness, with real b intent, 
they were c forgiven.

9 And their meetings were  a con-
ducted by the church after the man-
ner of the workings of the Spirit, 
and by the b power of the Holy Ghost; 
for as the power of the Holy Ghost 
led them whether to preach, or to 
exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, 
or to sing, even so it was done.
