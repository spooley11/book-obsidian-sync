God,  that  rather  than  shed  the

blood of their brethren they would 
c give up their own lives; and rather 
than take away from a brother they 
would  give  unto  him;  and  rather 
than spend their days in idleness 
they would labor abundantly with 
their hands.

19 And  thus  we  see  that,  when 
these  Lamanites  were  brought  to 
a believe and to know the truth, they  
were b firm, and would suffer even 
unto death rather than commit sin; 
and  thus  we  see  that  they  buried 
their weapons of peace, or they bur-
ied the weapons of war, for peace.
20 And it came to pass that their 
brethren, the Lamanites, made pre-
parations for war, and came up to 
the land of Nephi for the purpose 
of destroying the king, and to place 
a another  in  his  stead,  and  also  of  
destroying  the  people  of  Anti-
Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

21 Now when the people saw that 
they were coming against them they 
went out to meet them, and a pros-
trated themselves before them to the 
earth, and began to call on the name 
of  the  Lord;  and  thus  they  were 
in this attitude when the Laman-
ites began to fall upon them, and  
began to slay them with the sword.
22 And thus without meeting any 
resistance, they did slay a a thousand 
and five of them; and we know that 
they are blessed, for they have gone 
to dwell with their God.
