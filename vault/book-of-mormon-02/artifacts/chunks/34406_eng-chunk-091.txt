18 Because of their grief and much 
sorrow,  and  the  iniquity  of  my 
brethren, they were brought near 
even to be carried out of this time 
to meet their God; yea, their a grey 
hairs were about to be brought down 
to lie low in the dust; yea, even they 
were  near  to  be  cast  with  sorrow 
into a watery grave.

19 And Jacob and Joseph also, be-
ing  young,  having  need  of  much 
nourishment, were grieved because 
of the afflictions of their mother; 
and also a my wife with her tears and 
prayers, and also my children, did 
not soften the hearts of my breth-
ren that they would loose me.

20 And  there  was  nothing  save 
it  were  the  power  of  God,  which 
threatened them with destruction, 
could soften their  a hearts; where-
fore, when they saw that they were 
about  to  be  swallowed  up  in  the 
depths of the sea they repented of 
the thing which they had done, in-
somuch that they loosed me.

21 And it came to pass after they 
had loosed me, behold, I took the 
compass, and it did work whither I 
desired it. And it came to pass that 
I a prayed unto the Lord; and after 
I had prayed the winds did cease, 
and the storm did cease, and there 
was a great calm.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did guide the ship, that we 
sailed again towards the promised  
land.

23 And it came to pass that after 
we had sailed for the space of many 
days we did arrive at the a promised

land; and we went forth upon the 
land, and did pitch our tents; and 
we did call it the promised land.
