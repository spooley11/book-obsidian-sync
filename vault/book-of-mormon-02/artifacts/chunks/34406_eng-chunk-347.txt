the children of men; and now, for 
this cause thou shalt be put to death 
unless thou wilt recall all the words 
which  thou  hast  spoken  evil  con-
cerning me and my people.

9 Now  Abinadi  said  unto  him:  I 
say unto you, I will a not recall the 
words  which  I  have  spoken  unto 
you concerning this people, for they 
are true; and that ye may know of 
their surety I have suffered myself 
that I have fallen into your hands.
10 Yea, and I will a suffer even un-
til death, and I will not recall my 
words, and they shall stand as a b tes-
timony against you. And if ye slay 
me  ye  will  shed  c innocent  blood, 
and this shall also stand as a testi-
mony against you at the last day.

11 And now king Noah was about 
to  release  him,  for  he  feared  his 
word; for he feared that the judg-
ments of God would come upon him.
12 But the a priests lifted up their 
voices  against  him,  and  began  to 
accuse him, saying: He has reviled 
the  king.  Therefore  the  king  was 
stirred  up  in  b anger  against  him, 
and  he  delivered  him  up  that  he 
might be slain.

13 And it came to pass that they 
took  him  and  bound  him,  and 
a scourged  his  skin  with  faggots, 
yea, even unto b death.

14 And now when the flames be-
gan  to  scorch  him,  he  cried  unto 
them, saying:

15 Behold, even as ye have done 
unto  me,  so  shall  it  come  to  pass 
that  thy  a seed  shall  cause  that 
many shall suffer the pains that I 
do suffer, even the pains of b death 
by fire; and this because they be-
lieve  in  the  salvation  of  the  Lord  
their God.

16 And it will come to pass that ye 
shall be afflicted with all manner of  
a diseases because of your iniquities.
17 Yea,  and  ye  shall  be  smitten 
on every hand, and shall be driven 
and scattered to and fro, even as a 
wild  flock  is  driven  by  wild  and 
ferocious beasts.

18 And  in  that  day  ye  shall  be 
a hunted, and ye shall be taken by 
the hand of your enemies, and then 
ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains 
of b death by fire.
