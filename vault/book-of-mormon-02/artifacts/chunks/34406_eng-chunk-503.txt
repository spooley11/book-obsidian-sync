23 Now this was done in the pres-
ence of the queen and many of the 
servants.  And  when  they  saw  it 
they greatly marveled, and began 
to fear. And the king stood forth, 
and began to a minister unto them. 
And he did minister unto them, in-
somuch that his b whole household 
were c converted unto the Lord.

24 Now  there  was  a  multitude 
gathered  together  because  of  the 
commandment  of  the  queen,  and 
there  began  to  be  great  murmur-
ings among them because of Aaron 
and his brethren.

25 But the king stood forth among 
them and administered unto them. 
And  they  were  a pacified  towards 
Aaron and those who were with him.
26 And it came to pass that when 
the king saw that the people were 
pacified, he caused that Aaron and 
his brethren should stand forth in the  
midst of the multitude, and that they 
should preach the word unto them.
27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king sent a a proclamation through-
out  all  the  land,  amongst  all  his 
people  who  were  in  all  his  land, 
who were in all the regions round 
about,  which  was  bordering  even 
to the sea, on the east and on the 
b west, and which was divided from 
the land of  c Zarahemla by a narrow 
strip of wilderness, which ran from 
the  sea  east  even  to  the  sea  west, 
and round about on the borders of 
the seashore, and the borders of the 
wilderness which was on the north 
by the land of Zarahemla, through 
the borders of d Manti, by the head 
of the  e river Sidon, running from 
the  east  towards  the  west—and 
thus  were  the  Lamanites  and  the  
Nephites divided.
