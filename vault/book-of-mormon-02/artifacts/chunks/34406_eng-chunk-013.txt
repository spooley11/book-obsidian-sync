The firsT Book of nePhi

hiS reign And miniSTry

An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being called, (be-
ginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi 
to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people 
concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days’ 
journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and 
returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of 
their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their 
families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the 
wilderness. The course of their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s 
brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They 
call the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the 
promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in 
other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

CHAPTER 1

Nephi begins the record of his people—
Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire and 
reads  from  a  book  of  prophecy—He 
praises God, foretells the coming of the 
Messiah, and prophesies the destruction 
of Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the 
Jews. About 600 b.c.
