4 And it came to pass that we did 
come to the city of Angola, and we 
did take possession of the city, and 
make preparations to defend our-
selves against the Lamanites. And it 
came to pass that we did a fortify the 
city with our might; but notwith-
standing all our fortifications the 
Lamanites did come upon us and 
did drive us out of the city.
