11 Do ye not remember the things 
which  the  Lord  hath  said?—If  ye 
will  not  harden  your  hearts,  and 
a ask  me  in  b faith,  believing  that 
ye shall receive, with diligence in 
keeping my commandments, surely 
these things shall be made known 
unto you.

12 Behold, I say unto you, that the 
house of Israel was compared unto 
an  olive  tree,  by  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord which was in our father; and 
behold are we not broken off from 
the house of Israel, and are we not 
a a branch of the house of Israel?

13 And now, the thing which our 
father  meaneth  concerning  the 
grafting in of the natural branches 
through the fulness of the Gentiles, 
is, that in the latter days, when our 
seed  shall  have  a dwindled  in  un-
belief, yea, for the space of many 
years, and many generations after 
the  b Messiah  shall  be  manifested 
in body unto the children of men, 
then shall the fulness of the c gospel 
of the Messiah come unto the Gen-
tiles, and from the  d Gentiles unto 
the remnant of our seed—

14 And at that day shall the rem-
nant of our a seed b know that they 
are of the house of Israel, and that 
they are the c covenant people of the 
Lord; and then shall they know and

d come  to  the  e knowledge  of  their 
forefathers, and also to the knowl-
edge of the gospel of their Redeemer, 
which  was  ministered  unto  their 
fathers by him; wherefore, they shall 
come to the knowledge of their Re-
deemer and the very points of his 
doctrine, that they may know how 
to come unto him and be saved.

15 And then at that day will they 
not  rejoice  and  give  praise  unto 
their  everlasting  God,  their  a rock 
and their salvation? Yea, at that day, 
will they not receive the strength 
and  nourishment  from  the  true 
b vine? Yea, will they not come unto 
the true fold of God?

16 Behold,  I  say  unto  you,  Yea; 
they  shall  be  remembered  again 
among  the  house  of  Israel;  they 
shall be a grafted in, being a natu-
ral  branch  of  the  olive  tree,  into 
the true olive tree.
