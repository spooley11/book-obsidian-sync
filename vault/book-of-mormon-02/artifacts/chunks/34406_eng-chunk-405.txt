27 And behold, as they were cross-
ing the river Sidon, the Lamanites 
and  the  Amlicites,  being  as  a nu-
merous  almost,  as  it  were,  as  the 
sands of the sea, came upon them 
to destroy them.

28 Nevertheless, the Nephites be-
ing  a strengthened by the hand of 
the Lord, having prayed mightily 
to him that he would deliver them 
out of the hands of their enemies, 
therefore  the  Lord  did  hear  their 
cries, and did strengthen them, and 
the  Lamanites  and  the  Amlicites 
did fall before them.

29 And it came to pass that Alma 
fought with Amlici with the sword,

face to face; and they did contend 
mightily, one with another.

30 And it came to pass that Alma, 
being a man of God, being exercised 
with much a faith, cried, saying: O 
Lord,  have  mercy  and  b spare  my 
life,  that  I  may  be  an  instrument 
in thy hands to save and preserve 
this people.

31 Now when Alma had said these 
words  he  contended  again  with 
Amlici; and he was strengthened, 
insomuch that he slew Amlici with 
the sword.

32 And he also contended with the 
king of the Lamanites; but the king 
of  the  Lamanites  fled  back  from 
before Alma and sent his guards to  
contend with Alma.

33 But Alma, with his guards, con-
tended with the guards of the king 
of the Lamanites until he slew and 
drove them back.

34 And thus he cleared the ground, 
or rather the bank, which was on the 
west of the river Sidon, throwing the 
bodies of the Lamanites who had 
been slain into the waters of Sidon, 
that thereby his people might have 
room to cross and contend with the 
Lamanites and the Amlicites on the 
west side of the river Sidon.
