3 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they started to go up, hav-
ing with them one a Ammon, he be-
ing a strong and mighty man, and 
a  b descendant  of  Zarahemla;  and 
he was also their leader.

4 And  now,  they  knew  not  the 
course  they  should  travel  in  the 
wilderness to go up to the land of 
Lehi-Nephi;  therefore  they  wan-
dered many days in the wilderness, 
even a forty days did they wander.
5 And when they had wandered 
forty days they came to a a hill, which 
is north of the land of b Shilom, and 
there they pitched their tents.

6 And  a Ammon took three of his 
brethren,  and  their  names  were 
Amaleki,  Helem,  and  Hem,  and 
they  went  down  into  the  land  of  
b Nephi.

7 And behold, they met the king of 
the people who were in the land of 
Nephi, and in the land of a Shilom; 
and they were surrounded by the 
king’s guard, and were b taken, and 
were c bound, and were committed 
to d prison.

8 And it came to pass when they 
had been in prison two days they 
were again brought before the king, 
and their bands were loosed; and 
they stood before the king, and were 
permitted, or rather a commanded, 
that they should answer the ques-
tions which he should ask them.

9 And he said unto them: Behold, 
I am a Limhi, the son of Noah, who 
was  the  son  of  Zeniff,  who  came 
up  out  of  the  b land  of  Zarahemla 
to  inherit  this  land,  which  was 
the land of their fathers, who was 
made a  c king by the  d voice of the  
people.
