Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than 
in the days of Moroni, yea, even at 
this  time,  in  the  twenty  and  first 
year of the reign of the judges.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
twenty and second year of the reign 
of the judges also ended in peace; 
yea, and also the twenty and third 
year.

25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  in 
the commencement of the twenty 
and fourth year of the reign of the 
judges, there would also have been 
peace among the people of Nephi 
had  it  not  been  for  a  a contention 
which took place among them con-

land  of  c Morianton,  which  joined
