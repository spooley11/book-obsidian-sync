3 That  after  they  should  be  de-
stroyed, even that great city a Jeru-
salem, and many be b carried away 
captive into c Babylon, according to 
the own due time of the Lord, they 
should d return again, yea, even be 
brought back out of captivity; and 
after they should be brought back 
out of captivity they should possess 
again the land of their inheritance.
4 Yea,  even  a six  hundred  years 
from the time that my father left 
Jerusalem,  a  b prophet  would  the 
Lord God raise up among the c Jews—
even a d Messiah, or, in other words, 
a Savior of the world.

5 And he also spake concerning the 
prophets, how great a number had 
a testified of these things, concerning 
this Messiah, of whom he had spo-
ken, or this Redeemer of the world.
6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a 
a lost and in a b fallen state, and ever 
would be save they should rely on 
this Redeemer.

7 And he spake also concerning a 
a prophet who should come before 
the Messiah, to prepare the way of 
the Lord—

8 Yea, even he should go forth and 
cry in the wilderness: a Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord, and make his 
paths  straight;  for  there  standeth 
one among you whom ye know not; 
and  he  is  mightier  than  I,  whose 
shoe’s  latchet  I  am  not  worthy  to 
unloose. And much spake my father  
concerning this thing.
