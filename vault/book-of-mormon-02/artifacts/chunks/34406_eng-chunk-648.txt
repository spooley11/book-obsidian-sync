12 And behold, if ye do not this, 
I  will  come  against  you  with  my 
armies;  yea,  even  I  will  arm  my 
women and my children, and I will 
come against you, and I will follow 
you even into your own land, which 
is the land of  a our first inheritance; 
yea, and it shall be blood for blood, 
yea, life for life; and I will give you 
battle even until you are destroyed 
from off the face of the earth.

13 Behold, I am in my anger, and 
also my people; ye have sought to 
a murder us, and we have only sought 
to defend ourselves. But behold, if 
ye seek to destroy us more we will 
seek  to  destroy  you;  yea,  and  we 
will seek our land, the land of our 
first inheritance.

14 Now  I  close  my  epistle.  I  am 
Moroni; I am a leader of the people 
of the Nephites.

15 Now it came to pass that Am-
moron, when he had received this 
epistle,  was  angry;  and  he  wrote 
another  epistle  unto  Moroni,  and 
these are the words which he wrote, 
saying:

16 I am Ammoron, the king of the 
Lamanites; I am the brother of Amal-
ickiah  whom  ye  have  a murdered. 
Behold, I will avenge his blood upon 
you, yea, and I will come upon you 
with my armies for I fear not your 
threatenings.

17 For  behold,  your  fathers  did 
wrong  their  brethren,  insomuch

that  they  did  rob  them  of  their 
a right to the b government when it 
rightly belonged unto them.

18 And now behold, if ye will lay 
down your arms, and subject your-
selves  to  be  governed  by  those  to 
whom the government doth rightly 
belong, then will I cause that my 
people shall lay down their weap-
ons and shall be at war no more.

19 Behold, ye have breathed out 
many threatenings against me and 
my people; but behold, we fear not 
your threatenings.

20 Nevertheless, I will grant to ex-
change prisoners according to your 
request, gladly, that I may preserve 
my  food  for  my  men  of  war;  and 
we will wage a war which shall be 
eternal, either to the subjecting the 
Nephites to our authority or to their 
eternal extinction.
