23 And  thus  they  saw  that  the 
Nephites had power over them; and 
in these circumstances they found 
that it was not expedient that they 
should  fight  with  the  Nephites; 
therefore their chief a captains de-
manded their weapons of war, and 
they brought them forth and b cast 
them  at  the  feet  of  the  Nephites, 
pleading for mercy.

24 Now behold, this was the desire 
of Moroni. He took them prisoners 
of war, and took possession of the 
city, and caused that all the prison-
ers should be liberated, who were 
Nephites;  and  they  did  join  the 
army of Moroni, and were a great 
strength to his army.

25 And it came to pass that he did 
cause the Lamanites, whom he had 
taken  prisoners,  that  they  should 
commence a a labor in strengthen-
ing the fortifications round about 
the city Gid.

26 And it came to pass that when 
he  had  fortified  the  city  Gid,  ac-
cording  to  his  desires,  he  caused 
that his prisoners should be taken 
to the city Bountiful; and he also 
guarded that city with an exceed-
ingly strong force.

27 And it came to pass that they 
did,  notwithstanding  all  the  in-
trigues of the Lamanites, keep and 
protect all the prisoners whom they 
had taken, and also maintain all the 
ground  and  the  advantage  which 
they had retaken.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began a again to be victo-
rious,  and  to  reclaim  their  rights 
and their privileges.

29 Many times did the Lamanites 
attempt to encircle them about by 
night,  but  in  these  attempts  they 
did lose many prisoners.

30 And  many  times  did  they  at-
tempt to administer of their wine 
to  the  Nephites,  that  they  might 
destroy them with poison or with 
drunkenness.

31 But behold, the Nephites were 
not  slow  to  a remember  the  Lord 
their God in this their time of af-
fliction.  They  could  not  be  taken 
in their snares; yea, they would not 
partake of their wine, save they had 
first given to some of the Lamanite 
prisoners.
