CHAPTER 13
Ether  speaks  of  a  New  Jerusalem  to 
be built in America by the seed of Jo-
seph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes 
the  Jaredite  history,  and  foretells  the 
destruction of the Jaredites—War rages 
over all the land.

And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish  
my record concerning the destruc-
tion of the people of whom I have 
been writing.

2 For behold, they rejected all the  
words of Ether; for he truly told them 
of all things, from the beginning of  
man; and that after the waters had 
a receded from off the face of this 
b land it became a choice land above 
all other lands, a chosen land of the 
Lord;  wherefore  the  Lord  would 
have that all men should c serve him 
who dwell upon the face thereof;

3 And  that  it  was  the  place  of  
the a New Jerusalem, which should  
b come down out of heaven, and the 
holy sanctuary of the Lord.

4 Behold,  Ether  saw  the  days  of 
Christ,  and  he  spake  concerning 
a a New Jerusalem upon this land.

5 And he spake also concerning the 
house of Israel, and the a Jerusalem  
from whence b Lehi should come—af-
ter it should be destroyed it should 
be built up again, a c holy city unto 
the Lord; wherefore, it could not be 
a new Jerusalem for it had been in

a time of old; but it should be built 
up again, and become a holy city of  
the Lord; and it should be built unto  
the house of Israel—
