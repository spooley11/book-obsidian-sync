even  as  the  faces  of  angels.  And 
he  beheld  that  they  did  lift  their 
eyes  to  heaven;  and  they  were  in 
the attitude as if talking or lifting 
their  voices  to  some  being  whom 
they beheld.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  this 
man  did  cry  unto  the  multitude, 
that they might turn and look. And 
behold, there was power given unto 
them that they did turn and look; 
and  they  did  behold  the  faces  of 
Nephi and Lehi.

38 And  they  said  unto  the  man: 
Behold,  what  do  all  these  things 
mean,  and  who  is  it  with  whom 
these men do converse?

39 Now  the  man’s  name  was 
Amina dab.  And  Aminadab  said 
unto them: They do converse with 
the angels of God.

40 And it came to pass that the La-
manites said unto him: a What shall 
we do, that this cloud of darkness 
may  be  removed  from  overshad-
owing us?

41 And Aminadab said unto them: 
You must a repent, and cry unto the 
voice, even until ye shall have b faith 
in Christ, who was taught unto you 
by Alma, and  c Amulek, and Zeez-
rom; and when ye shall do this, the 
cloud of darkness shall be removed 
from overshadowing you.

42 And it came to pass that they 
all did begin to cry unto the voice 
of him who had shaken the earth; 
yea,  they  did  cry  even  until  the 
cloud of darkness was dispersed.

43 And it came to pass that when 
they cast their eyes about, and saw 
that the cloud of darkness was dis-
persed from overshadowing them, 
behold,  they  saw  that  they  were 
a encircled  about,  yea  every  soul, 
by a pillar of fire.

44 And a Nephi and b Lehi were in 
the midst of them; yea, they were 
encircled about; yea, they were as

if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet 
it did harm them not, neither did 
it take hold upon the walls of the 
prison;  and  they  were  filled  with 
that c joy which is unspeakable and 
full of glory.

45 And behold, the a Holy Spirit of 
God did come down from heaven, 
and did enter into their hearts, and  
they  were  filled  as  if  with  fire,  
and they could  b speak forth mar-
velous words.
