17 But  behold,  now  the  Laman-
ites  are  coming  upon  us,  taking 
a possession of our lands, and they 
are murdering our people with the 
sword,  yea,  our  women  and  our 
children,  and  also  carrying  them 
away  captive,  causing  them  that 
they  should  suffer  all  manner  of 
afflictions, and this because of the 
great wickedness of those who are 
seeking  for  power  and  authority, 
yea, even those king-men.

18 But why should I say much con-
cerning this matter? For we know 
not but what ye yourselves are seek-
ing for authority. We know not but 
what  ye  are  also  a traitors  to  your  
country.

19 Or is it that ye have neglected 
us because ye are in the heart of our 
country and ye are a surrounded by 
security, that ye do not cause food 
to be sent unto us, and also men to 
strengthen our armies?

20 Have  ye  forgotten  the  com-
mandments of the Lord your God? 
Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity 
of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the 
many times we have been delivered 
out of the hands of our enemies?

21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord 
a will  still  deliver  us,  while  we  sit 
upon our thrones and do not make 
use  of  the  means  which  the  Lord 
has provided for us?

22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while 
ye are surrounded with thousands 
of those, yea, and tens of thousands, 
who do also sit in idleness, while 
there  are  thousands  round  about 
in the borders of the land who are 
falling by the sword, yea, wounded 
and bleeding?

23 Do  ye  suppose  that  God  will  
look upon you as guiltless while ye 
sit  still  and  behold  these  things? 
Behold  I  say  unto  you,  Nay.  Now 
I would that ye should remember 
that God has said that the a inward 
vessel  shall  be  b cleansed  first, 
and then shall the outer vessel be 
cleansed also.
