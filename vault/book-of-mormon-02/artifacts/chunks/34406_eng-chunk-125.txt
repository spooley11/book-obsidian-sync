of the fruit of thy loins; and unto 
him  will  I  give  b power  to  c bring 
forth my word unto the seed of thy 
loins—and not to the bringing forth 
my word only, saith the Lord, but 
to the convincing them of my word, 
which shall have already gone forth 
among them.

12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins 
shall  a write;  and  the  fruit  of  the 
loins of b Judah shall c write; and that 
which shall be written by the fruit of 
thy loins, and also that which shall 
be written by the fruit of the loins 
of Judah, shall grow together, unto 
the d confounding of e false doctrines 
and laying down of contentions, and 
establishing f peace among the fruit 
of  thy  loins,  and  g bringing  them 
to the h knowledge of their fathers 
in the latter days, and also to the 
knowledge of my covenants, saith  
the Lord.

13 And out of weakness he shall 
be made strong, in that day when 
my work shall commence among all 
my people, unto the restoring thee, 
O house of Israel, saith the Lord.

14 And  thus  prophesied  Joseph, 
saying:  Behold,  that  seer  will  the 
Lord  bless;  and  they  that  seek  to 
destroy him shall be confounded; 
for this promise, which I have ob-
tained of the Lord, of the fruit of 
my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, 
I  am  sure  of  the  fulfilling  of  this 
promise;

15 And his a name shall be called af-
ter me; and it shall be after the b name 
of his father. And he shall be c like 
unto me; for the thing, which the 
Lord shall bring forth by his hand,

by the power of the Lord shall bring 
d my people unto e salvation.

16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I 
am sure of this thing, even as I am 
sure  of  the  promise  of  Moses;  for 
the Lord hath said unto me, I will 
a preserve thy seed forever.
