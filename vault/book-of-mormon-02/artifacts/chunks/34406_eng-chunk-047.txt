6 And  when  I  had  spoken  these 
words, the Spirit cried with a loud 
voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, 
the  most  high  God;  for  he  is  God 
over all the a earth, yea, even above 
all.  And  blessed  art  thou,  Nephi, 
because thou b believest in the Son 
of  the  most  high  God;  wherefore, 
thou shalt behold the things which 
thou hast desired.

7 And behold this thing shall be 
given unto thee for a a sign, that af-
ter thou hast beheld the tree which 
bore  the  fruit  which  thy  father 
tasted, thou shalt also behold a man 
descending out of heaven, and him 
shall ye witness; and after ye have 
witnessed him ye shall b bear record 
that it is the Son of God.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Spirit  said  unto  me:  Look!  And  I

looked and beheld a tree; and it was 
like unto the a tree which my father 
had seen; and the b beauty thereof 
was  far  beyond,  yea,  exceeding 
of  all  beauty;  and  the  c whiteness 
thereof  did  exceed  the  whiteness 
of the driven snow.

9 And it came to pass after I had 
seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: 
I behold thou hast shown unto me 
the tree which is a precious above all.
10 And  he  said  unto  me:  What

desirest thou?
