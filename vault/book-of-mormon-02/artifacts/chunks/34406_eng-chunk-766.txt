12 Therefore,  all  the  Lamanites 
who had become converted unto the 
Lord did unite with their brethren, 
the Nephites, and were compelled, 
for the a safety of their lives and their 
women and their children, to take 
up  arms  against  those  Gadianton  
robbers, yea, and also to maintain 
their rights, and the privileges of  
their church and of their worship,  
and their freedom and their b liberty.
13 And it came to pass that before 
this thirteenth year had passed away 
the Nephites were threatened with 
utter  destruction  because  of  this 
war, which had become exceedingly  
sore.

14 And it came to pass that those 
Lamanites who had united with the 
Nephites  were  numbered  among 
the Nephites;

15 And their a curse was taken from 
them, and their skin became b white 
like unto the Nephites;

16 And their young men and their 
daughters became exceedingly fair, 
and  they  were  numbered  among  
the Nephites, and were called Neph-
ites. And thus ended the thirteenth  
year.

17 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fourteenth year, 
the  war  between  the  robbers  and 
the people of Nephi did continue 
and did become exceedingly sore; 
nevertheless, the people of Nephi 
did  gain  some  advantage  of  the 
robbers,  insomuch  that  they  did 
drive them back out of their lands 
into the mountains and into their 
secret places.

18 And thus ended the fourteenth  
year. And in the fifteenth year they  
did come forth against the people 
of Nephi; and because of the wick-
edness of the people of Nephi, and 
their many contentions and dissen-
sions,  the  Gadianton  robbers  did 
gain many advantages over them.

19 And thus ended the fifteenth 
year, and thus were the people in 
a state of many afflictions; and the 
a sword of destruction did hang over 
them,  insomuch  that  they  were 
about  to  be  smitten  down  by  it, 
and this because of their iniquity.

CHAPTER 3

Giddianhi,  the  Gadianton  leader,  de-
mands that Lachoneus and the Neph-
ites  surrender  themselves  and  their 
lands—Lachoneus  appoints  Gidgid-
doni as chief captain of the armies—
The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla 
and  Bountiful  to  defend  themselves.  
About a.d. 16–18.
And now it came to pass that in the 
sixteenth year from the coming of 
Christ, a Lachoneus, the governor of 
the land, received an epistle from
