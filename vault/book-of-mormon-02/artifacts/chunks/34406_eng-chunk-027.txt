could not keep the commandments 
of the Lord according to the a law of  
Moses, save they should have the law.
16 And I also knew that the a law 
was  engraven  upon  the  plates  of 
brass.

17 And again, I knew that the Lord  
had delivered Laban into my hands 
for this cause—that I might obtain 
the records according to his com-
mandments.

18 Therefore I did obey the voice 
of  the  Spirit,  and  took  Laban  by 
the hair of the head, and I smote 
off his head with his own a sword.

head with his own sword, I took the 
garments  of  Laban  and  put  them 
upon  mine  own  body;  yea,  even 
every  whit;  and  I  did  gird  on  his 
armor about my loins.

20 And after I had done this, I went 
forth unto the treasury of Laban. 
And  as  I  went  forth  towards  the 
treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the 
a servant of Laban who had the keys 
of the treasury. And I commanded 
him in the voice of Laban, that he 
should go with me into the treasury.
21 And he supposed me to be his 
master,  Laban,  for  he  beheld  the 
garments and also the sword girded 
about my loins.

22 And  he  spake  unto  me  con-
cerning the a elders of the Jews, he 
knowing  that  his  master,  Laban, 
had been out by night among them.
23 And I spake unto him as if it

had been Laban.
