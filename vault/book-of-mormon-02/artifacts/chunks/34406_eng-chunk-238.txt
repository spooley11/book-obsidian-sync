20 And now, my brethren, I have 
spoken unto you concerning pride; 
and  those  of  you  which  have  af-
flicted  your  neighbor,  and  perse-
cuted him because ye were proud in 
your hearts, of the things which God 
hath given you, what say ye of it?

21 Do  ye  not  suppose  that  such 
things  are  abominable  unto  him 
who created all flesh? And the one 
being is as precious in his sight as 
the  other.  And  all  flesh  is  of  the 
dust; and for the selfsame end hath 
he created them, that they should 
keep his a commandments and glo-
rify him forever.

22 And  now  I  make  an  end  of 
speaking unto you concerning this 
pride. And were it not that I must 
speak unto you concerning a grosser 
crime, my heart would rejoice ex-
ceedingly because of you.

23 But the word of God burdens 
me because of your grosser crimes. 
For behold, thus saith the Lord: This  
people begin to wax in iniquity; they  
understand not the scriptures, for 
they seek to excuse themselves in 
committing a whoredoms, because of  
the things which were written con-
cerning David, and Solomon his son.
24 Behold,  David  and  a Solomon 
truly had many b wives and concu-
bines, which thing was c abominable 
before me, saith the Lord.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, 
I have led this people forth out of 
the land of Jerusalem, by the power 
of mine arm, that I might raise up

unto me a a righteous branch from 
the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will 
not suffer that this people shall do 
like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear 
me,  and  hearken  to  the  word  of 
the  Lord:  For  there  shall  not  any 
a man  among  you  have  save  it  be 
b one c wife; and concubines he shall  
have none;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in 
the a chastity of women. And b whore-
doms  are  an  abomination  before 
me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore,  this  people  shall 
keep my commandments, saith the 
Lord of Hosts, or a cursed be the land 
for their sakes.
