18 And it came to pass that Alma, 
having  a authority  from  God,  b or-
dained priests; even one priest to 
every fifty of their number did he 
ordain to preach unto them, and to 
c teach them concerning the things 
pertaining to the kingdom of God.
19 And he commanded them that 
a they  should  b teach  nothing  save 
it  were  the  things  which  he  had 
taught, and which had been spoken 
by the mouth of the holy prophets.
20 Yea, even he commanded them 
that  they  should  a preach  nothing 
save it were repentance and faith 
on  the  Lord,  who  had  redeemed 
his people.

21 And he commanded them that

there should be no a contention one 
with another, but that they should 
look forward with b one eye, having 
one faith and one baptism, having 
their hearts c knit together in unity 
and in love one towards another.

22 And thus he commanded them 
to  preach.  And  thus  they  became 
the a children of God.

23 And he commanded them that 
they  should  observe  the  a sabbath 
day, and keep it holy, and also ev-
ery day they should give thanks to 
the Lord their God.

24 And he also commanded them 
that  the  priests  whom  he  had  or-
dained  a should  b labor  with  their 
own hands for their support.

25 And there was a one day in every 
week that was set apart that they 
should b gather themselves together 
to teach the people, and to worship 
the Lord their God, and also, as of-
ten as it was in their power, to c as-
semble themselves together.

26 And the priests were not to de-
pend upon the people for their sup-
port; but for their labor they were 
to  receive  the  a grace  of  God,  that 
they might wax strong in the Spirit, 
having the b knowledge of God, that 
they might teach with power and 
authority from God.

27 And  again  Alma  commanded 
that the people of the church should 
impart  of  their  substance,  a every 
one  according  to  that  which  he 
had;  if  he  have  more  abundantly 
he should impart more abundantly; 
and of him that had but little, but
