20 For behold, I have workings in 
the  spirit,  which  doth  a weary  me 
even  that  all  my  joints  are  weak, 
for those who are at Jerusalem; for 
had not the Lord been merciful, to 
show  unto  me  concerning  them, 
even  as  he  had  prophets  of  old,  I 
should have perished also.

21 And  he  surely  did  show  unto 
the a prophets of old all things b con-
cerning them; and also he did show 
unto many concerning us; where-
fore, it must needs be that we know 
concerning them for they are writ-
ten upon the plates of brass.

22 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, did teach my brethren these 
things; and it came to pass that I did 
read many things to them, which 
were engraven upon the a plates of 
brass,  that  they  might  know  con-
cerning the doings of the Lord in 
other lands, among people of old.

23 And  I  did  read  many  things 
unto  them  which  were  written 
in the  a books of Moses; but that I 
might more fully persuade them to 
believe in the Lord their Redeemer 
I  did  read  unto  them  that  which 
was written by the prophet b Isaiah; 
for I did c liken all scriptures unto 
us, that it might be for our d profit 
and learning.

24 Wherefore I spake unto them, 
saying:  Hear  ye  the  words  of  the 
prophet, ye who are a a remnant of 
the house of Israel, a b branch who 
have been broken off; c hear ye the 
words of the prophet, which were 
written unto all the house of Israel, 
and liken them unto yourselves, that 
ye may have hope as well as your 
brethren from whom ye have been 
broken  off;  for  after  this  manner 
has the prophet written.
