25 And whosoever shall believe in 
my name, doubting nothing, unto 
him will I a confirm all my words, 
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 And now, behold, who can stand 
a against  the  works  of  the  Lord? 
b Who  can  deny  his  sayings?  Who 
will  rise  up  against  the  almighty 
power  of  the  Lord?  Who  will  de-
spise the works of the Lord? Who 
will despise the children of Christ? 
Behold, all ye who are c despisers of 
the works of the Lord, for ye shall 
wonder and perish.

27 O then despise not, and wonder 
not, but hearken unto the words of 
the Lord, and ask the Father in the 
name of Jesus for what things so-
ever ye shall stand in need. a Doubt 
not, but be believing, and begin as 
in times of old, and b come unto the 
Lord with all your c heart, and d work 
out  your  own  salvation  with  fear 
and trembling before him.

28 Be  a wise  in  the  days  of  your 
b probation;  strip  yourselves  of  all 
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may 
consume it on your c lusts, but ask 
with a firmness unshaken, that ye 
will  yield  to  no  temptation,  but 
that  ye  will  serve  the  true  and  
d living God.

29 See  that  ye  are  not  baptized 
a unworthily;  see  that  ye  partake 
not  of  the  sacrament  of  Christ 
b unworthily; but see that ye do all
