20 And now it came to pass in the 
commencement of the nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, that Helaman 
went forth among the people to de-
clare the a word unto them.

21 For  behold,  because  of  their 
wars  with  the  Lamanites  and  the 
many little dissensions and distur-
bances which had been among the 
people, it became expedient that the 
a word  of  God  should  be  declared 
among them, yea, and that a b regu-
lation should be made throughout 
the church.

22 Therefore,  a Helaman  and  his 
brethren went forth to establish the 
church again in all the land, yea, in 
every city throughout all the land 
which was possessed by the people

of Nephi. And it came to pass that 
they did appoint b priests and c teach-
ers throughout all the land, over all 
the churches.

23 And now it came to pass that 
after  Helaman  and  his  brethren 
had appointed priests and teachers 
over the churches that there arose a 
a dissension among them, and they 
would not give heed to the words 
of Helaman and his brethren;

lifted  up  in  their  hearts,  because 
of their exceedingly great a riches; 
therefore  they  grew  rich  in  their 
own eyes, and would not give heed 
to their words, to b walk uprightly 
before God.
