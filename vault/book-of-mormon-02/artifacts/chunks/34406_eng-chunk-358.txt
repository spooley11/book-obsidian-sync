14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye 
shall not slay him, but bring him 
hither that I may see him. And they 
brought him. And Limhi said unto 
him: What cause have ye to come 
up to war against my people? Be-
hold, my people have not broken the 
a oath that I made unto you; there-
fore, why should ye break the oath 
which ye made unto my people?

15 And now the king said: I have 
broken the oath because thy peo-
ple did carry away the daughters of 
my people; therefore, in my anger 
I did cause my people to come up 
to war against thy people.

16 And now Limhi had heard noth-
ing concerning this matter; there-
fore  he  said:  I  will  search  among 
my people and whosoever has done 
this thing shall perish. Therefore he 
caused a search to be made among 
his people.

17 Now when a Gideon had heard 
these  things,  he  being  the  king’s 
captain,  he  went  forth  and  said 
unto the king: I pray thee forbear, 
and do not search this people, and 
lay not this thing to their charge.

18 For  do  ye  not  remember  the 
priests  of  thy  father,  whom  this 
people sought to destroy ? And are 
they not in the wilderness? And are 
not they the ones who have stolen 
the daughters of the Lamanites?

19 And now, behold, and tell the 
king of these things, that he may

tell  his  people  that  they  may  be 
pacified  towards  us;  for  behold 
they are already preparing to come 
against  us;  and  behold  also  there 
are but few of us.

20 And  behold,  they  come  with 
their numerous hosts; and except 
the king doth pacify them towards 
us we must perish.

21 For are not the words of Abin-
adi a fulfilled, which he prophesied 
against us—and all this because we 
would not hearken unto the words 
of the Lord, and turn from our in-
iquities?

22 And now let us pacify the king, 
and  we  fulfil  the  a oath  which  we 
have made unto him; for it is bet-
ter that we should be in bondage 
than that we should lose our b lives; 
therefore, let us put a stop to the 
shedding of so much blood.
