b repay;  and  because  this  people 
repented not after I had delivered 
them, behold, they shall be cut off 
from the face of the earth.

16 And it came to pass that I ut-
terly refused to go up against mine 
enemies; and I did even as the Lord 
had commanded me; and I did stand 
as an idle witness to manifest unto 
the world the things which I saw 
and heard, according to the mani-
festations of the Spirit which had 
testified of things to come.

17 Therefore  I  write  a unto  you, 
Gentiles, and also unto you, house 
of Israel, when the work shall com-
mence, that ye shall be about to pre-
pare to return to the land of your  
inheritance;

18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the 
ends  of  the  earth;  yea,  unto  you, 
twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be  
a judged according to your works by 
the twelve whom Jesus chose to be  
his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.
19 And I write also unto the rem-
nant of this people, who shall also 
be  judged  by  the  a twelve  whom 
Jesus chose in this land; and they 
shall be judged by the other twelve 
whom  Jesus  chose  in  the  land  of  
Jerusalem.

20 And these things doth the Spirit 
manifest unto me; therefore I write 
unto you all. And for this cause I 
write unto you, that ye may know 
that  ye  must  all  stand  before  the 
a judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every 
soul who belongs to the whole hu-
man b family of Adam; and ye must 
stand to be judged of your works, 
whether they be good or evil;

21 And also that ye may a believe 
the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ,  which 
ye shall b have among you; and also
