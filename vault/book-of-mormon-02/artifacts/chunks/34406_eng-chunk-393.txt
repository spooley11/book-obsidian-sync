anything  b contrary  to  that  which 
is right; but it is common for the 
lesser part of the c people to desire 
that  which  is  not  right;  therefore 
this shall ye observe and make it 
your law—to do your business by 
the voice of the people.

27 And  a if  the  time  comes  that 
the voice of the people doth choose 
iniquity, then is the time that the 
judgments of God will come upon 
you; yea, then is the time he will 
visit you with great destruction even 
as he has hitherto visited this land.
28 And now if ye have judges, and 
they do not a judge you according to 
the law which has been given, ye 
can cause that they may be judged 
of a higher judge.

29 If  your  higher  judges  do  not 
judge righteous judgments, ye shall 
cause that a small number of your 
lower  judges  should  be  gathered 
together, and they shall judge your 
higher judges, according to the voice 
of the people.

30 And I command you to do these 
things in the fear of the Lord; and 
I command you to do these things, 
and  that  ye  have  no  king;  that  if 
these people commit sins and iniq-
uities they shall be answered upon 
their own heads.

31 For behold I say unto you, the 
sins  of  many  people  have  been 
a caused  by  the  iniquities  of  their 
kings;  therefore  their  iniquities 
are  answered  upon  the  heads  of 
their kings.

32 And now I desire that this a in-
equality should be no more in this 
land, especially among this my peo-
ple; but I desire that this land be a 
land of b liberty, and c every man may 
enjoy his rights and privileges alike, 
so long as the Lord sees fit that we 
may live and inherit the land, yea,
