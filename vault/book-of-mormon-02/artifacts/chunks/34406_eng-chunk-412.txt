13 Now this was a great cause for 
lamentations  among  the  people, 
while  others  were  abasing  them-
selves, succoring those who stood in 
need of their succor, such as impart-
ing their substance to the a poor and 
the needy, feeding the hungry, and 
suffering all manner of b afflictions, 
for Christ’s c sake, who should come  
according to the spirit of prophecy;
14 Looking  forward  to  that  day, 
thus  a retaining  a  b remission  of 
their sins; being filled with great 
c joy because of the resurrection of 
the dead, according to the will and 
power  and  d deliverance  of  Jesus 
Christ from the bands of death.

15 And now it came to pass that

c laws according to the laws which 
had been given, and to put them in 
force according to the wickedness 
and the crimes of the people.

b chief  judge;  and  he  sat  in  the  
judgment-seat to judge and to gov-
ern the people.
