“Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was 
glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. 
The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately 
around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the 
fear soon left me.

“He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent 
from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God 
had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and 
evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both 
good and evil spoken of among all people.

“He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an 
account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from 
whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel 
was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;
“Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fas-
tened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thum-
mim—deposited  with  the  plates;  and  the  possession  and  use  of  these 
stones were what constituted ‘seers’ in ancient or former times; and that 
God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book. . . .

“Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spo-
ken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I 
should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the 
Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to 
show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with 
me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see 
the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and dis-
tinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.
