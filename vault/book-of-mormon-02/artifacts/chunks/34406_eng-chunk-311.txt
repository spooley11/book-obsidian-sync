10 And now, a I desire to know the 
cause whereby ye were so bold as 
to come near the walls of the city, 
when I, myself, was with my guards 
without the b gate?

11 And  now,  for  this  cause  have 
I  suffered  that  ye  should  be  pre-
served, that I might inquire of you, 
or  else  I  should  have  caused  that 
my guards should have put you to 
death. Ye are permitted to speak.

12 And  now,  when  Ammon  saw 
that  he  was  permitted  to  speak, 
he went forth and a bowed himself 
before  the  king;  and  rising  again 
he said: O king, I am very thankful 
before God this day that I am yet 
alive, and am permitted to speak; 
and I will endeavor to speak with 
boldness;

13 For I am assured that if ye had 
known me ye would not have suf-
fered that I should have worn these 
bands.  For  I  am  Ammon,  and  am 
a  a descendant  of  Zarahemla,  and 
have come up out of the  b land of 
Zarahemla  to  inquire  concerning 
our brethren, whom c Zeniff brought 
up out of that land.

14 And now, it came to pass that 
after Limhi had heard the words of 
Ammon, he was exceedingly a glad, 
and said: Now, I know of a surety 
that my brethren who were in the 
land  of  Zarahemla  are  b yet  alive. 
And now, I will rejoice; and on the 
morrow I will cause that my people 
shall rejoice also.

15 For behold, we are in bondage 
to  the  Lamanites,  and  are  a taxed 
with  a  tax  which  is  grievous  to 
be  borne.  And  now,  behold,  our 
brethren will deliver us out of our 
b bondage, or out of the hands of the
