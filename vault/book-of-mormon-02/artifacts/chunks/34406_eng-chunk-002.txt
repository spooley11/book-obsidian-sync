The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the

Bible. It is a record of God’s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the

Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.

The  book  was  written  by  many  ancient  prophets  by  the  spirit  of 
prophecy  and  revelation.  Their  words,  written  on  gold  plates,  were 
quoted  and  abridged  by  a  prophet-historian  named  Mormon.  The 
record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Je-
rusalem  in  600 b.c.  and  afterward  separated  into  two  nations,  known 
as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when 
the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is 
known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed ex-
cept the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American 
Indians.
