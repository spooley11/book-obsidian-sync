standing I shall lengthen out mine 
arm  unto  them  from  day  to  day, 
they will deny me; nevertheless, I 
will be merciful unto them, saith 
the  Lord  God,  if  they  will  repent 
and b come unto me; for mine c arm 
is lengthened out all the day long, 
saith the Lord God of Hosts.

CHAPTER 29
Many Gentiles will reject the Book of 
Mormon—They will say, We need no 
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many 
nations—He will judge the world out of 
the books which will be written. About 
559–545 b.c.
But behold, there shall be many—
at that day when I shall proceed to 
do a a marvelous work among them, 
that I may remember my b covenants 
which I have made unto the chil-
dren of men, that I may set my hand

unto  thee,  Nephi,  and  also  unto 
thy father, that I would remember

of your seed should proceed forth 
out of my mouth unto your seed; 
and  my  words  shall  b hiss  forth 
unto  the  c ends  of  the  earth,  for  a  
d standard  unto  my  people,  which 
are of the house of Israel;

forth—many of the Gentiles shall 
say:  A  a Bible!  A  Bible!  We  have
