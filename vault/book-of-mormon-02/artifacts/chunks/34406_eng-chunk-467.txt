24 And the chief judge stood be-
fore them, and smote them again, 
and said unto them: If ye have the 
a power  of  God  deliver  yourselves 
from these bands, and then we will 
believe that the Lord will destroy 
this people according to your words.
25 And it came to pass that they all 
went forth and smote them, saying 
the same words, even until the last; 
and when the last had spoken unto 
them the a power of God was upon 
Alma  and  Amulek,  and  they  rose 
and stood upon their feet.

26 And Alma cried, saying: How 
long  shall  we  suffer  these  great 
a afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, b give 
us strength according to our faith 
which is in Christ, even unto  c de-
liverance. And they broke the cords 
with which they were bound; and 
when the people saw this, they be-
gan to flee, for the fear of destruc-
tion had come upon them.

27 And it came to pass that so great 
was their fear that they fell to the 
earth, and did not obtain the outer 
door of the a prison; and the earth 
shook  mightily,  and  the  walls  of 
the  prison  were  rent  in  twain,  so 
that they fell to the earth; and the 
chief judge, and the lawyers, and 
priests,  and  teachers,  who  smote 
upon Alma and Amulek, were slain 
by the fall thereof.

28 And  Alma  and  Amulek  came 
forth  out  of  the  prison,  and  they 
were  not  hurt;  for  the  Lord  had 
granted unto them a power, accord-
ing to their faith which was in Christ.

And  they  straightway  came  forth 
out  of  the  prison;  and  they  were 
b loosed from their c bands; and the 
prison had fallen to the earth, and 
every soul within the walls thereof, 
save it were Alma and Amulek, was 
slain;  and  they  straightway  came 
forth into the city.

29 Now the people having heard a 
great noise came running together by 
multitudes to know the cause of it; 
and when they saw Alma and Amu-
lek coming forth out of the prison, 
and the walls thereof had fallen to 
the  earth,  they  were  struck  with 
great fear, and fled from the pres-
ence of Alma and Amulek even as a 
goat fleeth with her young from two 
lions; and thus they did flee from 
the presence of Alma and Amulek.
