4 a Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those 
things  which  thou  hast  done;  for  
I have beheld how thou hast with 
b unwearyingness declared the word,  
which I have given unto thee, unto 
this people. And thou hast not feared 
them,  and  hast  not  sought  thine  
c own life, but hast sought my d will, 
and to keep my commandments.

5 And now, because thou hast done 
this with such unwearyingness, be-
hold, I will bless thee forever; and I 
will make thee mighty in word and 
in deed, in faith and in works; yea, 
even that a all things shall be b done

unto thee according to thy  c word, 
for thou shalt d not ask that which 
is contrary to my will.

6 Behold,  thou  art  Nephi,  and  I 
am God. Behold, I declare it unto 
thee in the presence of mine angels, 
that ye shall have power over this 
people,  and  shall  smite  the  earth 
with a famine, and with pestilence, 
and  destruction,  according  to  the 
wickedness of this people.

7 Behold, I give unto you a power, 
that  whatsoever  ye  shall  b seal  on 
earth  shall  be  sealed  in  heaven; 
and  whatsoever  ye  shall  loose  on 
earth shall be loosed in heaven; and 
thus  shall  ye  have  power  among 
this people.

8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this 
temple it shall be rent in twain, it 
shall be done.

9 And  if  ye  shall  say  unto  this 
a mountain, Be thou cast down and 
become smooth, it shall be done.

10 And behold, if ye shall say that 
God shall smite this people, it shall 
come to pass.

11 And  now  behold,  I  command 
you,  that  ye  shall  go  and  declare 
unto this people, that thus saith the 
Lord God, who is the Almighty: Ex-
cept ye repent ye shall be smitten, 
even unto a destruction.
