3 a Touch  me  not,  for  God  shall 
smite  you  if  ye  lay  your  hands 
upon me, for I have not delivered 
the  message  which  the  Lord  sent 
me to deliver; neither have I told 
you that which ye b requested that I 
should tell; therefore, God will not 
suffer that I shall be destroyed at  
this time.

4 But I must fulfil the command-
ments  wherewith  God  has  com-
manded me; and because I have told 
you the truth ye are angry with me. 
And again, because I have spoken 
the word of God ye have judged me 
that I am mad.

5 Now it came to pass after Abin-
adi had spoken these words that the 
people of king Noah durst not lay 
their hands on him, for the Spirit 
of the Lord was upon him; and his 
face a shone with exceeding luster, 
even  as  Moses’  did  while  in  the 
mount of Sinai, while speaking with  
the Lord.

6 And he spake with a power and 
authority from God; and he contin-
ued his words, saying:

MOSIAH 13  : 8–27

slay me, therefore I finish my a mes-
sage.  Yea,  and  I  perceive  that  it 
cuts you to your hearts because I 
tell you the truth concerning your  
iniquities.

8 Yea, and my words fill you with 
wonder and amazement, and with 
anger.

9 But  I  finish  my  message;  and 
then it  a matters not whither I go, 
if it so be that I am saved.

10 But this much I tell you, what 
you a do with me, after this, shall be 
as a b type and a shadow of things 
which are to come.
