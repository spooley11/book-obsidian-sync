AND now behold, it came to pass

in the commencement of the  
   fortieth  year  of  the  reign  of 
the judges over the people of Nephi, 
there began to be a serious difficulty 
among the people of the Nephites.
2 For behold, a Pahoran had died, 
and gone the way of all the earth; 
therefore there began to be a serious 
contention concerning who should 
have the judgment-seat among the 
brethren,  who  were  the  sons  of  
Pahoran.

3 Now these are their names who

did contend for the judgment-seat, 
who  did  also  cause  the  people  to 
contend:  Pahoran,  Paanchi,  and 
Pacumeni.

4 Now  these  are  not  all  the  sons 
of Pahoran (for he had many), but 
these are they who did contend for 
the judgment-seat; therefore, they 
did  cause  three  a divisions  among 
the people.

5 Nevertheless,  it  came  to  pass 
that  Pahoran  was  appointed  by 
the a voice of the people to be chief 
judge and a governor over the people  
of Nephi.

6 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni,  when  he  saw  that  he  could 
not  obtain  the  judgment-seat,  he 
did  a unite  with  the  voice  of  the  
people.

7 But  behold,  Paanchi,  and  that 
part of the people that were desir-
ous that he should be their governor, 
was exceedingly wroth; therefore,
