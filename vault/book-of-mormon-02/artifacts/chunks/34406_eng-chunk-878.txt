16 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and forty and fifth 
year the Nephites did begin to flee 
before the Lamanites; and they were 
pursued until they came even to the 
land of Jashon, before it was pos-
sible to stop them in their retreat.
17 And  now,  the  city  of  Jashon 
was near the  a land where Amma-
ron had b deposited the records unto 
the  Lord,  that  they  might  not  be 
destroyed. And behold I had gone 
according to the word of Ammaron, 
and taken the c plates of Nephi, and 
did make a record according to the 
words of Ammaron.

make a full account of their wicked-
ness and abominations, for behold, 
a continual scene of wickedness and 
abominations has been before mine 
eyes ever since I have been suffi-
cient to behold the ways of man.

wickedness; for my heart has been 
filled with sorrow because of their 
wickedness, all my days; neverthe-
less, I know that I shall be  a lifted 
up at the last day.

year the people of Nephi again were 
hunted and driven. And it came to 
pass that we were driven forth un-
til we had come northward to the 
land which was called Shem.
