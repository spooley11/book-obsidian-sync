the work of the Lord, neither con-
sider the operation of his hands.

13 Therefore, my people are gone 
into  a captivity, because they have 
no b knowledge; and their honorable 
men are famished, and their mul-
titude dried up with thirst.

14 Therefore, hell hath enlarged her-
self, and opened her mouth without 
measure; and their glory, and their 
multitude, and their pomp, and he 
that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
15 And  the  mean  man  shall  be 
a brought  down,  and  the  b mighty 
man  shall  be  humbled,  and  the 
eyes of the c lofty shall be humbled.
16 But the Lord of Hosts shall be 
exalted in a judgment, and God that 
is holy shall be sanctified in righ-
teousness.

17 Then shall the lambs feed after 
their manner, and the waste places 
of the a fat ones shall strangers eat.
18 Wo unto them that draw iniq-
uity with cords of a vanity, and sin 
as it were with a cart rope;

19 That say: Let him a make speed, 
b hasten his work, that we may c see 
it; and let the counsel of the Holy 
One of Israel draw nigh and come, 
that we may know it.

20 Wo  unto  them  that  a call  b evil 
good, and good evil, that put c dark-
ness  for  light,  and  light  for  dark-
ness, that put bitter for sweet, and 
sweet for bitter!

21 Wo unto the a wise in their own  
eyes and b prudent in their own sight!
22 Wo  unto  the  mighty  to  drink 
a wine, and men of strength to min-
gle strong drink;

23 Who justify the wicked for a re-
ward, and take away the righteous-
ness of the righteous from him!

24 Therefore, as the a fire devoureth 
the  b stubble,  and  the  flame  con-
sumeth the c chaff, their d root shall 
be rottenness, and their blossoms 
shall  go  up  as  dust;  because  they 
have cast away the law of the Lord 
of Hosts, and e despised the word of 
the Holy One of Israel.
