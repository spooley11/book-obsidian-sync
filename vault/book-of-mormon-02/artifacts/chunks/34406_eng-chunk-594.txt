14 Now  those  descendants  were 
as  numerous,  nearly,  as  were  the 
Nephites;  and  thus  the  Nephites 
were obliged to contend with their 
brethren, even unto bloodshed.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  as  the 
armies of the Lamanites had gath-
ered together in the land of Antio-
num,  behold,  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites  were  prepared  to  meet 
them in the a land of Jershon.

16 Now,  the  leader  of  the  Neph-
ites, or the man who had been a ap-
pointed  to  be  the  b chief  captain 
over  the  Nephites—now  the  chief 
captain  took  the  command  of  all 
the  armies  of  the  Nephites—and 
his name was Moroni;

17 And Moroni took all the com-
mand, and the government of their 
wars.  And  he  was  only  twenty 
and  five  years  old  when  he  was 
appointed  chief  captain  over  the 
armies of the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that he met 
the Lamanites in the borders of Jer-
shon,  and  his  people  were  armed 
with  swords,  and  with  cimeters, 
and all manner of  a weapons of war.
19 And  when  the  armies  of  the 
Lamanites saw that the people of 
Nephi,  or  that  Moroni,  had  a pre-
pared his people with b breastplates 
and with arm-shields, yea, and also 
shields to defend their heads, and

also they were dressed with thick 
clothing—

20 Now the army of Zerahemnah 
was  not  prepared  with  any  such 
thing; they had only their a swords 
and their cimeters, their bows and 
their arrows, their b stones and their 
slings; and they were c naked, save 
it  were  a  skin  which  was  girded 
about their loins; yea, all were na-
ked, save it were the Zoramites and 
the Amalekites;

21 But they were not armed with 
breastplates, nor shields—therefore, 
they were exceedingly afraid of the 
armies of the Nephites because of 
their armor, notwithstanding their 
number being so much greater than 
the Nephites.
