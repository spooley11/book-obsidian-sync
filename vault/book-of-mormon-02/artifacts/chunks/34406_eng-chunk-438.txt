22 Yea,  and  after  having  been  
a delivered of God out of the land 
of  Jerusalem,  by  the  hand  of  the 
Lord;  having  been  b saved  from 
famine, and from sickness, and all 
manner of diseases of every kind; 
and  they  having  waxed  strong  in 
battle, that they might not be de-
stroyed; having been brought out of 
c bondage time after time, and hav-
ing been kept and preserved until 
now; and they have been prospered 
until they are rich in all manner of  
things—

23 And now behold I say unto you, 
that  if  this  people,  who  have  re-
ceived so many blessings from the 
hand of the Lord, should transgress 
a contrary  to  the  light  and  knowl-
edge which they do have, I say unto 
you that if this be the case, that if 
they should fall into transgression, 
it would be far more b tolerable for 
the Lamanites than for them.

24 For behold, the a promises of the 
Lord are extended to the Lamanites, 
but they are not unto you if ye trans-
gress; for has not the Lord expressly

if ye will rebel against him that ye 
shall b utterly be destroyed from off 
the face of the earth?

people,  declaring  unto  them  that

nigh at hand;
