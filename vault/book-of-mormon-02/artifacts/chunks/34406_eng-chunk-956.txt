20 And in the second year the word 
of the Lord came to Ether, that he 
should go and a prophesy unto b Cori-
antumr  that,  if  he  would  repent, 
and  all  his  household,  the  Lord 
would give unto him his kingdom 
and spare the people—

21 Other wise  they  should  be 
destroyed,  and  all  his  household  
save it were himself. And he should 
only live to see the fulfilling of the 
prophecies which had been spoken 
concerning a another people receiv-
ing the land for their inheritance; 
and  Coriantumr  should  receive 
a  burial  by  them;  and  every  soul 
should  be  destroyed  save  it  were 
b Coriantumr.

22 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr  repented  not,  neither  his 
household, neither the people; and  
the wars ceased not; and they sought 
to  a kill  Ether,  but  he  fled  from  
before them and hid again in the 
cavity of the rock.

23 And it came to pass that there 
arose up Shared, and he also gave 
battle unto Coriantumr; and he did 
beat him, insomuch that in the third 
year he did bring him into captivity.
24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in 
the  fourth  year,  did  beat  Shared, 
and did obtain the kingdom again 
unto their father.

25 Now  there  began  to  be  a  war
