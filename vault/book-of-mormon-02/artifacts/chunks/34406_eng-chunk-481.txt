3 And  they  answered  the  king, 
and said: Whether he be the Great 
Spirit or a man, we know not; but 
this  much  we  do  know,  that  he 
a cannot  be  slain  by  the  enemies  
of the king; neither can they b scatter 
the  king’s  flocks  when  he  is  with 
us, because of his expertness and 
c great strength; therefore, we know 
that he is a friend to the king. And 
now, O king, we do not believe that 
a man has such great power, for we 
know he cannot be slain.

4 And now, when the king heard 
these words, he said unto them: Now 
I  know  that  it  is  the  Great  Spirit; 
and he has come down at this time 
to preserve your lives, that I might 
not  a slay you as I did your breth-
ren.  Now  this  is  the  Great  Spirit 
of whom our fathers have spoken.
5 Now  this  was  the  a tradition  of 
Lamoni,  which  he  had  received

from  his  father,  that  there  was  a 
b Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they 
believed in a Great Spirit, they sup-
posed that c whatsoever they did was 
right; nevertheless, Lamoni began 
to fear exceedingly, with fear lest 
he had done wrong in slaying his 
servants;

6 For he had slain many of them 
because their brethren had scattered 
their flocks at the place of water; 
and thus, because they had had their 
flocks scattered they were slain.

7 Now it was the practice of these 
Lamanites to stand by the a waters 
of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the 
people,  that  thereby  they  might 
drive  away  many  that  were  scat-
tered unto their own land, it being 
a practice of plunder among them.
8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Lamoni  inquired  of  his  servants, 
saying: Where is this man that has 
such great power?
