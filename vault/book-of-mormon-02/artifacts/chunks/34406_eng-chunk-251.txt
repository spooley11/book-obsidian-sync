28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant of the Lord of the vineyard did 
nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.
29 And it came to pass that a a long 
time had passed away, and the Lord 
of the vineyard said unto his b ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into the 
vineyard, that we may labor again 
in  the  vineyard.  For  behold,  the 
time  draweth  near,  and  the  c end 
soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay 
up  fruit  against  the  season,  unto 
mine own self.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant went down into the vineyard; 
and  they  came  to  the  tree  whose 
natural branches had been broken 
off, and the wild branches had been 
grafted in; and behold all a sorts of 
fruit did cumber the tree.

31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard did  a taste of 
the fruit, every sort according to its 
number. And the Lord of the vine-
yard  said:  Behold,  this  long  time 
have  we  nourished  this  tree,  and 
I have laid up unto myself against 
the season much fruit.

32 But  behold,  this  time  it  hath 
brought forth much a fruit, and there

is  b none  of  it  which  is  good.  And 
behold, there are all kinds of bad 
fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, 
notwithstanding all our labor; and 
now  it  grieveth  me  that  I  should 
lose this tree.

33 And the Lord of the vineyard 
said unto the servant: What shall 
we do unto the tree, that I may pre-
serve again good fruit thereof unto 
mine own self?

34 And the servant said unto his 
master: Behold, because thou didst 
graft  in  the  branches  of  the  wild 
olive tree they have nourished the 
roots, that they are alive and they 
have not perished; wherefore thou 
beholdest that they are yet good.

35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto his 
servant: The tree profiteth me noth-
ing, and the roots thereof profit me 
nothing  so  long  as  it  shall  bring 
forth evil fruit.
