5 And  now,  as  the  a preaching  of 
the b word had a great tendency to 
c lead the people to do that which 
was just—yea, it had had more pow-
erful effect upon the minds of the  
people than the sword, or anything

them—therefore  Alma  thought  it 
was expedient that they should try

6 Therefore he took Ammon, and 
Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he 
did  leave  in  the  church  in  Zara-
hemla;  but  the  former  three  he 
took  with  him,  and  also  a Amulek 
and Zeezrom, who were at b Melek;

are the names of those who went 
with him among the c Zoramites, to 
preach unto them the word.

8 Now  the  Zoramites  were  a dis-
senters  from  the  Nephites;  there-
fore they had had the word of God 
preached unto them.

9 But they had a fallen into great 
errors, for they would not observe 
to keep the commandments of God,
