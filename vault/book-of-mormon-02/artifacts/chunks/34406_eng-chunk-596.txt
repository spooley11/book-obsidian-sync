26 And  he  caused  that  all  the 
people in that quarter of the land 
should gather themselves together 
to battle against the Lamanites, to 
defend their lands and their coun-
try,  their  rights  and  their  liber-
ties; therefore they were prepared 
against the time of the coming of 
the Lamanites.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
roni  caused  that  his  army  should 
be secreted in the valley which was 
near  the  bank  of  the  river  Sidon, 
which was on the west of the river 
Sidon in the wilderness.

28 And Moroni placed spies round 
about,  that  he  might  know  when 
the camp of the Lamanites should  
come.

29 And now, as Moroni knew the 
a intention of the Lamanites, that it 
was their intention to destroy their 
brethren, or to  b subject them and 
bring them into bondage that they 
might  establish  a  kingdom  unto 
themselves over all the land;

30 And  he  also  knowing  that  it 
was the a only desire of the Nephites 
to preserve their lands, and their 
b liberty, and their church, therefore 
he thought it no sin that he should 
defend them by c stratagem; there-
fore, he found by his spies which 
course the Lamanites were to take.

31 Therefore, he divided his army 
and  brought  a  part  over  into  the 
valley, and a concealed them on the 
east,  and  on  the  south  of  the  hill  
Riplah;

32 And the remainder he concealed 
in the west a valley, on the west of  
the river Sidon, and so down into 
the borders of the land Manti.

33 And  thus  having  placed  his 
army  according  to  his  desire,  he 
was prepared to meet them.

34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites came up on the north of 
the hill, where a part of the army 
of Moroni was concealed.

35 And  as  the  Lamanites  had 
passed  the  hill  Riplah,  and  came 
into the valley, and began to cross 
the  river  Sidon,  the  army  which 
was concealed on the south of the 
hill, which was led by a man whose 
name was a Lehi, and he led his army 
forth and encircled the Lamanites 
about on the east in their rear.
