CHAPTER 27
The Lord commands Ammon to lead 
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—
Upon  meeting  Alma,  Ammon’s  joy 
exhausts  his  strength—The  Nephites 
give the Anti-Nephi-Lehies the land of 
Jershon—They are called the people of 
Ammon. About 90–77 b.c.
Now  it  came  to  pass  that  when 
those  Lamanites  who  had  gone 
to  war  against  the  Nephites  had 
found, after their a many struggles 
to destroy them, that it was in vain 
to seek their destruction, they re-
turned again to the land of Nephi.
2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Amalekites,  because  of  their  loss, 
were exceedingly angry. And when 
they saw that they could not seek 
revenge from the Nephites, they be-
gan to a stir up the people in anger

against their b brethren, the people 
of c Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they 
began again to destroy them.

3 Now this people a again refused to 
take their arms, and they suffered 
themselves to be slain according to 
the desires of their enemies.

4 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren  saw  this  work  of  destruction 
among those whom they so dearly 
beloved, and among those who had 
so  dearly  beloved  them—for  they 
were treated as though they were 
angels sent from God to save them 
from  everlasting  destruction— 
therefore,  when  Ammon  and  his 
brethren  saw  this  great  work  of 
destruction, they were moved with 
compassion,  and  they  a said  unto  
the king:

5 Let us gather together this peo-
ple of the Lord, and let us go down 
to  the  land  of  Zarahemla  to  our 
brethren the Nephites, and flee out 
of the hands of our enemies, that 
we be not destroyed.
