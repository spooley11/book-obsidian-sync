8 And  Alma  went  and  began  to 
declare the word of God unto the 
church  which  was  established  in  
the valley of Gideon, according to 
the  revelation  of  the  truth  of  the 
word  which  had  been  spoken  by 
his  fathers,  and  according  to  the 
spirit  of  prophecy  which  was  in 
him, according to the a testimony of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who 
should come to redeem his people 
from their sins, and the holy order 
by which he was called. And thus 
it is written. Amen.

The  words  of  Alma  which  he  
delivered to the people in Gideon, 
according to his own record.

CHAPTER 7

Christ will be born of Mary—He will 
loose the bands of death and bear the 
sins of His people—Those who repent, 
are baptized, and keep the command-
ments will have eternal life—Filthiness 
cannot inherit the kingdom of God—
Humility, faith, hope, and charity are 
required. About 83 b.c.
Behold my beloved brethren, see-
ing that I have been permitted to 
come unto you, therefore I attempt 
to address you in my language; yea, 
by my  a own mouth, seeing that it 
is  the  first  time  that  I  have  spo-
ken unto you by the words of my 
mouth, I having been wholly con-
fined to the b judgment-seat, having 
had much business that I could not 
come unto you.
