MOSIAH 4  : 25–5  : 4

the beggar, because ye have not; I 
would  that  ye  say  in  your  hearts 
that: I a give not because I b have not, 
but if I had I would c give.

25 And now, if ye say this in your 
hearts  ye  remain  guiltless,  other-
wise ye are a condemned; and your 
condemnation is just for ye covet 
that which ye have not received.

26 And now, for the sake of these 
things  which  I  have  spoken  unto 
you—that is, for the sake of retain-
ing a remission of your sins from 
day to day, that ye may a walk guilt-
less  before  God—I  would  that  ye 
should  b impart  of  your  substance 
to  the  c poor,  every  man  accord-
ing to that which he hath, such as 
d feeding the hungry, clothing the 
naked, visiting the sick and admin-
istering to their relief, both spiri-
tually and temporally, according to  
their wants.

27 And see that all these things are 
done in wisdom and  a order; for it 
is not requisite that a man should 
run  b faster  than  he  has  strength. 
And again, it is expedient that he 
should be diligent, that thereby he 
might win the prize; therefore, all 
things must be done in order.

28 And  I  would  that  ye  should 
remember, that whosoever among  
you  a borroweth  of  his  neighbor 
should  return  the  thing  that  he 
borroweth,  according  as  he  doth 
agree,  or  else  thou  shalt  commit 
sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause 
thy neighbor to commit sin also.

29 And finally, I cannot tell you all 
the things whereby ye may commit 
sin; for there are divers ways and 
means, even so many that I cannot 
number them.

30 But this much I can tell you, that 
if ye do not a watch yourselves, and  
your  b thoughts,  and  your  c words,  
and your deeds, and observe the com-
mandments of God, and d continue  
in the faith of what ye have heard 
concerning the coming of our Lord, 
even  unto  the  end  of  your  lives, 
ye must perish. And now, O man,  
remember, and perish not.
