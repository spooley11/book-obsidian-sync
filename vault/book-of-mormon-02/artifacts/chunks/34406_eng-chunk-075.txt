1 NEPHI 16  : 21–35

even that they did a murmur against  
the Lord.

21 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, having been afflicted with 
my brethren because of the loss of 
my bow, and their bows having lost 
their a springs, it began to be exceed-
ingly difficult, yea, insomuch that 
we could obtain no food.

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  speak  much  unto  my  breth-
ren,  because  they  had  hardened  
their hearts again, even unto a com-
plaining against the Lord their God.
23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  did  a make  out  of  wood  a 
bow, and out of a straight stick, an 
arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself 
with  a  bow  and  an  arrow,  with  a 
sling  and  with  stones.  And  I  said 
unto my b father: Whither shall I go  
to obtain food?

24 And it came to pass that he did 
a inquire of the Lord, for they had 
b humbled  themselves  because  of 
my words; for I did say many things 
unto them in the energy of my soul.
25 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  Lord  came  unto  my 
father; and he was truly a chastened 
because of his murmuring against 
the  Lord,  insomuch  that  he  was 
brought  down  into  the  depths  of 
sorrow.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
voice  of  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Look upon the ball, and behold the 
things which are written.

27 And it came to pass that when 
my father beheld the things which 
were a written upon the ball, he did 
fear and tremble exceedingly, and 
also my brethren and the sons of 
Ishmael and our wives.
