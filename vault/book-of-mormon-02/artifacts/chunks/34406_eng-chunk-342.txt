19 For were it not for the redemp-
tion  which  he  hath  made  for  his 
people, which was prepared from 
the a foundation of the world, I say 
unto  you,  were  it  not  for  this,  all 
mankind must have b perished.

20 But  behold,  the  bands  of 
death  shall  be  broken,  and  the 
Son reigneth, and hath power over 
the dead; therefore, he bringeth to 
pass the resurrection of the dead.
21 And there cometh a resurrec-
tion, even a a first resurrection; yea, 
even  a  resurrection  of  those  that 
have been, and who are, and who 
shall be, even until the resurrection 
of Christ—for so shall he be called.
22 And  now,  the  resurrection  of 
all the prophets, and all those that 
have believed in their words, or all 
those that have kept the command-
ments of God, shall come forth in 
the first resurrection; therefore, they 
are the first resurrection.

23 They are raised to a dwell with

God who has redeemed them; thus 
they  have  eternal  life  through 
Christ, who has b broken the bands  
of death.

24 And these are those who have 
part in the first resurrection; and 
these are they that have died before 
Christ came, in their ignorance, not 
having  a salvation  declared  unto 
them. And thus the Lord bringeth 
about the restoration of these; and 
they have a part in the first resur-
rection, or have eternal life, being 
redeemed by the Lord.

25 And little  a children also have

eternal life.

26 But  behold,  and  a fear,  and 
tremble  before  God,  for  ye  ought 
to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth 
none such that b rebel against him 
and c die in their sins; yea, even all 
those  that  have  perished  in  their 
sins  ever  since  the  world  began, 
that have wilfully rebelled against 
God, that have known the command-
ments of God, and would not keep 
them; d these are they that have e no 
part in the first f resurrection.

27 Therefore ought ye not to trem-
ble? For salvation cometh to none 
such; for the Lord hath redeemed 
none  such;  yea,  neither  can  the 
Lord  redeem  such;  for  he  cannot 
deny himself; for he cannot deny 
a justice when it has its claim.
