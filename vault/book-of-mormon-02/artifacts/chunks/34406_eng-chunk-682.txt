16 And it came to pass after they 
had taken them, they caused them 
to enter into a a covenant that they 
would no more take up their weap-
ons of war against the Nephites.

17 And  when  they  had  entered 
into this covenant they sent them to 
a dwell with the people of Ammon, 
and they were in number about four 
thousand who had not been slain.
18 And it came to pass that when 
they had sent them away they pur-
sued their march towards the land 
of a Nephihah. And it came to pass 
that when they had come to the city 
of Nephihah, they did pitch their 
tents  in  the  plains  of  Nephihah, 
which is near the city of Nephihah.
19 Now Moroni was desirous that 
the  Lamanites  should  come  out 
to  battle  against  them,  upon  the 
plains; but the Lamanites, knowing 
of their exceedingly great courage, 
and  beholding  the  greatness  of 
their numbers, therefore they durst 
not come out against them; there-
fore they did not come to battle in  
that day.

20 And  when  the  night  came,  
Moroni went forth in the darkness 
of  the  night,  and  came  upon  the 
top of the wall to spy out in what

part of the city the Lamanites did 
camp with their army.

21 And it came to pass that they 
were on the east, by the entrance; 
and they were all asleep. And now 
Moroni returned to his army, and 
caused  that  they  should  prepare 
in haste strong cords and ladders, 
to be let down from the top of the 
a wall into the inner part of the wall.
22 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused that his men should march 
forth and come upon the top of the 
wall, and let a themselves down into 
that part of the city, yea, even on 
the west, where the Lamanites did 
not camp with their armies.

23 And it came to pass that they 
were all let down into the city by 
night, by the means of their strong 
cords and their ladders; thus when 
the  morning  came  they  were  all 
within the walls of the city.

24 And now, when the Lamanites 
awoke and saw that the armies of 
Moroni were within the walls, they 
were  affrighted  exceedingly,  in-
somuch  that  they  did  flee  out  by 
the pass.
