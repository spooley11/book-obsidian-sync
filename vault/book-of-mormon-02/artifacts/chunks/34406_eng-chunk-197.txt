after they had been bitten by the 
poisonous serpents, if they would 
cast  their  eyes  unto  the  c serpent 
which he did raise up before them, 
and  also  gave  him  power  that  he 
should smite the d rock and the wa-
ter should come forth; yea, behold 
I say unto you, that as these things 
are e true, and as the Lord God liv-
eth, there is none other f name given 
under heaven save it be this Jesus 
Christ,  of  which  I  have  spoken, 
whereby man can be saved.

21 Wherefore, for this cause hath 
the  Lord  God  promised  unto  me 
that  these  things  which  I  a write 
shall  be  kept  and  preserved,  and 
handed down unto my seed, from 
generation to generation, that the 
promise may be fulfilled unto Jo-
seph,  that  his  seed  should  never 
b perish as long as the earth should  
stand.

22 Wherefore,  these  things  shall 
go  from  generation  to  generation 
as long as the earth shall stand; and 
they shall go according to the will 
and  pleasure  of  God;  and  the  na-
tions who shall possess them shall 
be a judged of them according to the 
words which are written.

23 For we labor diligently to write, 
to a persuade our children, and also 
our brethren, to believe in Christ, 
and to be reconciled to God; for we
