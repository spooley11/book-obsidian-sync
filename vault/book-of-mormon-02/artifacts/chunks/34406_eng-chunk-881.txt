7 And it came to pass that in the 
three hundred and sixty and first 
year the Lamanites did come down 
to the a city of Desolation to battle 
against us; and it came to pass that 
in that year we did beat them, inso-
much that they did return to their 
own lands again.

8 And in the three hundred and 
sixty  and  second  year  they  did 
come  down  a again  to  battle.  And 
we  did  beat  them  again,  and  did

slay a great number of them, and 
their dead were cast into the sea.

9 And now, because of this great 
thing which my people, the Neph-
ites, had done, they began to a boast 
in  their  own  strength,  and  began 
to  swear  before  the  heavens  that 
they  would  avenge  themselves  of 
the  blood  of  their  brethren  who 
had been slain by their enemies.

10 And  they  did  a swear  by  the 
heavens,  and  also  by  the  throne 
of God, that they b would go up to 
battle  against  their  enemies,  and 
would cut them off from the face of  
the land.

11 And it came to pass that I, Mor-
mon, did utterly a refuse from this 
time forth to be a commander and 
a leader of this people, because of 
their wickedness and abomination.
12 Behold, I had led them, notwith-
standing their wickedness I had led 
them many times to battle, and had 
loved them, according to the a love of 
God which was in me, with all my 
heart; and my soul had been poured 
out in prayer unto my God all the 
day long for them; nevertheless, it 
was b without faith, because of the 
c hardness of their hearts.

13 And  a thrice  have  I  delivered 
them out of the hands of their en-
emies, and they have repented not 
of their sins.

14 And when they had sworn by 
all that had been a forbidden them 
by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
that they would go up unto their 
enemies to battle, and avenge them-
selves of the blood of their breth-
ren,  behold  the  voice  of  the  Lord 
came unto me, saying:
