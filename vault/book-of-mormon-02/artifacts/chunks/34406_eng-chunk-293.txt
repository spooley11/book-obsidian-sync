MOSIAH 2  : 38–3  : 5

all righteousness; therefore, the Lord  
has no place in him, for he dwelleth  
not in c unholy temples.

38 Therefore  if  that  man  a re-
penteth not, and remaineth and di-
eth an enemy to God, the demands 
of  divine  b justice  do  awaken  his 
immortal soul to a lively sense of 
his  own  c guilt,  which  doth  cause 
him to shrink from the  d presence 
of the Lord, and doth fill his breast 
with guilt, and e pain, and f anguish, 
which is like an unquenchable g fire, 
whose flame ascendeth up forever  
and ever.

39 And now I say unto you, that 
a mercy hath no claim on that man; 
therefore his final doom is to endure 
a never-ending b torment.

40 O, all ye a old men, and also ye 
young men, and you little children 
who can understand my words, for 
I have spoken plainly unto you that 
ye might understand, I pray that ye 
should  awake  to  a  b remembrance 
of the awful situation of those that 
have fallen into transgression.
