21 And  the  angel  said  unto  me: 
Knowest thou the meaning of the 
book?

22 And I said unto him: I know not.
23 And  he  said:  Behold  it  pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. 
And  I,  Nephi,  beheld  it;  and  he 
said unto me: The a book that thou 
beholdest is a b record of the c Jews, 
which  contains  the  covenants  of 
the Lord, which he hath made unto 
the house of Israel; and it also con-
taineth many of the prophecies of 
the holy prophets; and it is a record 
like unto the engravings which are 
upon the d plates of brass, save there 
are not so many; nevertheless, they 
contain the covenants of the Lord, 
which he hath made unto the house 
of Israel; wherefore, they are of great 
worth unto the Gentiles.

24 And the angel of the Lord said 
unto me: Thou hast beheld that the 
a book  proceeded  forth  from  the 
mouth of a Jew; and when it pro-
ceeded forth from the mouth of a   Jew 
it contained the fulness of the gospel

of  the  Lord,  of  whom  the  twelve 
apostles bear record; and they bear 
record according to the truth which 
is in the Lamb of God.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth 
from the a Jews in purity unto the 
b Gentiles,  according  to  the  truth 
which is in God.

26 And after they go forth by the 
a hand  of  the  twelve  apostles  of  
the Lamb, from the Jews b unto the 
Gentiles, thou seest the formation of 
that c great and abominable d church, 
which  is  most  abominable  above 
all other churches; for behold, they 
have e taken away from the gospel 
of the Lamb many parts which are 
f plain and most precious; and also 
many covenants of the Lord have 
they taken away.

27 And all this have they done that 
they might pervert the right ways 
of the Lord, that they might blind 
the eyes and harden the hearts of 
the children of men.

28 Wherefore, thou seest that after 
the book hath gone forth through 
the hands of the great and abomi-
nable church, that there are many 
plain  and  a precious  things  taken 
away from the book, which is the 
book of the Lamb of God.
