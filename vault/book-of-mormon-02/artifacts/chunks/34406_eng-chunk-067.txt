3 For he truly spake many great 
things unto them, which were hard 
to be a understood, save a man should 
inquire of the Lord; and they be-
ing hard in their hearts, therefore 
they did not look unto the Lord as 
they ought.

4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts,  and  also,  because  of  the 
things which I had seen, and knew 
they  must  unavoidably  come  to  
pass because of the great wicked-
ness of the children of men.

5 And it came to pass that I was 
overcome because of my afflictions, 
for I considered that mine a afflic-
tions were great above all, because 
of  the  b destruction  of  my  people, 
for I had beheld their fall.

6 And it came to pass that after I 
had received a strength I spake unto 
my brethren, desiring to know of 
them the cause of their disputations.
7 And they said: Behold, we cannot 
understand  the  words  which  our 
father hath spoken concerning the 
natural branches of the a olive tree, 
and also concerning the Gentiles.

8 And I said unto them: Have ye

a inquired of the Lord?

1 NEPHI 15  : 9–18

9 And they said unto me: a We have 
not; for the Lord maketh no such 
thing known unto us.

10 Behold, I said unto them: How 
is it that ye do not keep the com-
mandments of the Lord? How is it 
that ye will a perish, because of the 
hardness of your hearts?
