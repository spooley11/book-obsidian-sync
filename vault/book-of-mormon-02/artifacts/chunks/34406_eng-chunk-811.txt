shall drink; nor yet for your body, 
what ye shall put on. Is not the life 
more than meat, and the body than 
d raiment?

26 Behold  the  a fowls  of  the  air, 
for  they  sow  not,  neither  do  they 
reap nor gather into barns; yet your 
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are 
ye not much better than they ?

27 Which of you by taking thought 
can add one cubit unto his stature?
28 And  why  take  ye  thought  for 
raiment? Consider the a lilies of the 
field how they grow; they toil not, 
neither do they spin;

29 And  yet  I  say  unto  you,  that 
even Solomon, in all his glory, was 
not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the 
grass of the field, which today is, 
and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
even so will he clothe you, if ye are 
not of little faith.

31 Therefore take no thought, say-
ing,  What  shall  we  eat?  or,  What  
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall  
we be clothed?

32 For your heavenly Father know-
eth that ye have need of all these 
things.

33 But a seek ye first the b kingdom  
of God and his righteousness, and 
all  these  things  shall  be  added 
unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for 
the morrow, for the morrow shall 
take  thought  for  the  things  of  it-
self. a Sufficient is the day unto the 
evil thereof.

CHAPTER 14

Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God; 
beware  of  false  prophets—He  prom-
ises salvation to those who do the will 
of  the  Father—Compare  Matthew  7. 
About a.d. 34.
a And now it came to pass that when

Jesus  had  spoken  these  words  he 
turned  again  to  the  multitude, 
and did open his mouth unto them 
again,  saying:  Verily,  verily,  I  say 
unto you, Judge not, that ye be not  
judged.

2 a For  with  what  judgment  ye 
judge, ye shall be judged; and with 
what measure ye mete, it shall be 
measured to you again.

3 And  why  beholdest  thou  the 
mote  that  is  in  thy  brother’s  eye, 
but considerest not the beam that 
is in thine own eye?
