7 And  now  I,  Nephi,  cannot  say 
more;  the  Spirit  stoppeth  mine 
utterance, and I am left to mourn 
because  of  the  a unbelief,  and  the 
wickedness, and the ignorance, and 
the b stiffneckedness of men; for they 
will  c not  search  d knowledge,  nor 
understand great knowledge, when 
it is given unto them in e plainness, 
even as plain as word can be.

8 And now, my beloved brethren, I 
perceive that ye ponder still in your 
hearts; and it grieveth me that I must 
speak concerning this thing. For if 
ye would hearken unto the a Spirit 
which teacheth a man to b pray, ye 
would know that ye must c pray; for 
the d evil spirit teacheth not a man 
to pray, but teacheth him that he 
must not pray.

9 But behold, I say unto you that 
ye must a pray always, and not faint; 
that ye must not perform any thing 
unto the Lord save in the first place 
ye  shall  b pray  unto  the  Father  in
