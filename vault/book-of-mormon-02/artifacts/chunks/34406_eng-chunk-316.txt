5 And it came to pass that he caused 
that the a plates which contained the 
b record of his people from the time 
that  they  left  the  c land  of  Zara-
hemla,  should  be  brought  before  
Ammon, that he might read them.
6 Now,  as  soon  as  Ammon  had

having  discovered  a  land  which 
had  been  peopled  with  a  people 
who were as numerous as the hosts  
of Israel.

things that they had said are true 
they  have  brought  a twenty-four 
plates  which  are  filled  with  en-
gravings, and they are of pure gold.
10 And  behold,  also,  they  have 
brought  a breastplates,  which  are
