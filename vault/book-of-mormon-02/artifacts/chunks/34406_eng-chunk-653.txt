32 And  they  were  thus  cautious 
that  no  poison  should  be  admin-
istered  among  them;  for  if  their 
wine  would  poison  a  Lamanite  it 
would also poison a Nephite; and 
thus they did try all their liquors.
33 And now it came to pass that it 
was expedient for Moroni to make  
preparations to attack the city  a Mori-
anton;  for  behold,  the  Lamanites

had,  by  their  labors,  fortified  the 
city Morianton until it had become 
an exceeding stronghold.

34 And  they  were  continually 
bringing new forces into that city, 
and also new supplies of provisions.
35 And thus ended the twenty and 
ninth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 56

Helaman sends an epistle to Moroni, 
recounting  the  state  of  the  war  with 
the Lamanites—Antipus and Helaman 
gain a great victory over the Laman-
ites—Helaman’s two thousand stripling 
sons fight with miraculous power, and 
none of them are slain. Verse 1, about 
62 b.c.; verses 2–19, about 66 b.c.; and 
verses 20–57, about 65–64 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement  of  the  thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges, on 
the second day in the first month, 
a Moroni received an  b epistle from 
Helaman, stating the affairs of the 
people in c that quarter of the land.
2 And these are the words which 
he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved 
brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord 
as  in  the  tribulations  of  our  war-
fare; behold, my beloved brother, 
I  have  somewhat  to  tell  you  con-
cerning our warfare in this part of  
the land.

3 Behold, a two thousand of the sons 
of those men whom Ammon brought 
down out of the land of Nephi—now 
ye have known that these were de-
scendants of Laman, who was the 
eldest son of our father Lehi;

4 Now  I  need  not  rehearse  unto 
you concerning their traditions or 
their  unbelief,  for  thou  knowest 
concerning all these things—

5 Therefore  it  sufficeth  me  that 
I  tell  you  that  two  thousand  of 
these young men have taken their
