9 And it came to pass that I caused 
that the women and children of my 
people should be hid in the wilder-
ness; and I also caused that all my 
old men that could bear arms, and 
also  all  my  young  men  that  were 
able  to  bear  arms,  should  gather 
themselves together to go to battle 
against  the  Lamanites;  and  I  did 
place  them  in  their  ranks,  every 
man according to his age.

10 And it came to pass that we did 
go up to battle against the Lamanites;  
and I, even I, in my old age, did go 
up to battle against the Lamanites. 
And it came to pass that we did go up  
in the a strength of the Lord to battle.
11 Now, the Lamanites knew noth-
ing  concerning  the  Lord,  nor  the 
strength of the Lord, therefore they 
depended upon their own strength. 
Yet  they  were  a  strong  people,  as 
to the a strength of men.

12 They  were  a  a wild,  and  fero-
cious, and a blood-thirsty people, 
believing in the b tradition of their 
fathers,  which  is  this—Believing 
that they were driven out of the land  
of Jerusalem because of the iniqui-
ties of their fathers, and that they 
were c wronged in the wilderness by 
their brethren, and they were also 
wronged while crossing the sea;

keeping the commandments of the
