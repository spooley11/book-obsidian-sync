Lehi descended from Manasseh—Amu-
lek recounts the angelic command that 
he care for Alma—The prayers of the 
righteous cause the people to be spared—
Unrighteous lawyers and judges lay the 
foundation  of  the  destruction  of  the 
people. About 82 b.c.
Now  these  are  the  a words  which 
b Amulek preached unto the people 
who were in the land of Ammoni-
hah, saying:

2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Gid-
donah, who was the son of Ishmael, 
who was a descendant of Aminadi; 
and it was that same Aminadi who 
interpreted  the  a writing  which 
was  upon  the  wall  of  the  temple, 
which  was  written  by  the  finger  
of God.

3 And Aminadi was a descendant 
of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, 
who came out of the land of Jeru-
salem,  who  was  a  descendant  of  
a Manasseh,  who  was  the  son  of  
b Joseph who was  c sold into Egypt 
by the hands of his brethren.

4 And behold, I am also a man of 
no small a reputation among all those 
who know me; yea, and behold, I 
have many kindreds and b friends, 
and I have also acquired much riches 
by the hand of my c industry.

5 Nevertheless,  after  all  this,  I 
never  have  known  much  of  the 
ways of the Lord, and his a mysteries  
and marvelous power. I said I never 
had known much of these things; 
but  behold,  I  mistake,  for  I  have 
seen much of his mysteries and his  
marvelous power; yea, even in the 
preservation  of  the  lives  of  this 
people.
