13 Behold  their  women  did  toil 
and spin, and did a make all manner 
of b cloth, of fine-twined linen and 
cloth of every kind, to clothe their 
nakedness. And thus the sixty and 
fourth year did pass away in peace.
14 And in the sixty and fifth year 
they did also have great joy and peace, 
yea,  much  preaching  and  many 
prophecies concerning that which 
was to come. And thus passed away  
the sixty and fifth year.

15 And it came to pass that in the 
sixty and sixth year of the reign of 
the judges, behold,  a Cezoram was 
murdered by an unknown hand as 
he sat upon the judgment-seat. And 
it  came  to  pass  that  in  the  same 
year, that his son, who had been ap-
pointed by the people in his stead, 
was also murdered. And thus ended  
the sixty and sixth year.

16 And  in  the  commencement 
of  the  sixty  and  seventh  year  the 
people began to grow exceedingly 
wicked again.

17 For behold, the Lord had blessed 
them  so  long  with  the  a riches  of 
the world that they had not been 
stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to 
bloodshed; therefore they began to 
set their hearts upon their riches; 
yea, they began to seek to get gain 
that  they  might  be  lifted  up  one 
above another; therefore they began 
to commit b secret murders, and to 
rob and to plunder, that they might 
get gain.

18 And now behold, those murder-
ers and plunderers were a band who 
had been formed by Kishkumen and 
a Gadianton. And now it had come 
to pass that there were many, even 
among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s

band. But behold, they were more 
numerous among the more wicked 
part  of  the  Lamanites.  And  they 
were called Gadianton’s robbers and  
murderers.

19 And it was they who did mur-
der the chief judge a Cezoram, and 
his son, while in the judgment-seat; 
and behold, they were not found.

20 And now it came to pass that 
when  the  Lamanites  found  that 
there were robbers among them they 
were  exceedingly  sorrowful;  and 
they did use every means in their 
power to destroy them off the face  
of the earth.
