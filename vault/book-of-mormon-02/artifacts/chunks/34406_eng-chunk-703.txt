14 But  behold,  Moronihah  did 
a preach many things unto the peo-
ple because of their iniquity, and 
also  b Nephi  and  Lehi,  who  were 
the  sons  of  Helaman,  did  preach 
many things unto the people, yea, 
and did prophesy many things unto  
them  concerning  their  iniquities, 
and what should come unto them 
if they did not repent of their sins.
15 And it came to pass that they 
did repent, and inasmuch as they 
did repent they did begin to prosper.
16 For when Moronihah saw that 
they did repent he did venture to 
a lead them forth from place to place, 
and  from  city  to  city,  even  until 
they had regained the one-half of  
their  property  and  the  one-half  
of all their lands.

17 And thus ended the sixty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.
18 And it came to pass in the sixty 
and second year of the reign of the 
judges,  that  Moronihah  could  ob-
tain no more possessions over the 
Lamanites.

19 Therefore  they  did  abandon 
their design to obtain the remain-
der of their lands, for so numerous 
were the Lamanites that it became 
impossible for the Nephites to ob-
tain more power over them; there-
fore Moronihah did employ all his

armies in maintaining those parts 
which he had taken.

20 And it came to pass, because of 
the greatness of the number of the 
Lamanites the Nephites were in great 
fear, lest they should be overpow-
ered, and trodden down, and slain,  
and destroyed.

21 Yea, they began to remember 
the a prophecies of Alma, and also the 
b words of Mosiah; and they saw that 
they had been a c stiffnecked people, 
and that they had set at d naught the  
commandments of God;

22 And that they had altered and 
trampled under their feet the a laws 
of Mosiah, or that which the Lord 
commanded him to give unto the 
people; and they saw that their laws 
had  become  corrupted,  and  that 
they had become a wicked people, 
insomuch  that  they  were  wicked 
even like unto the Lamanites.

23 And because of their iniquity 
the church had begun to a dwindle; 
and they began to disbelieve in the 
spirit of prophecy and in the spirit 
of revelation; and the judgments of  
God did stare them in the face.
