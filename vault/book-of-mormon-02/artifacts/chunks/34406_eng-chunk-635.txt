19 And it came to pass that there 
were four thousand of those  a dis-
senters who were hewn down by the 
sword;  and  those  of  their  leaders 
who were not slain in battle were 
taken  and  b cast  into  prison,  for 
there was no time for their trials at  
this period.

20 And  the  remainder  of  those 
dissenters, rather than be smitten 
down  to  the  earth  by  the  sword, 
yielded to the standard of liberty, 
and  were  compelled  to  hoist  the 
a title of liberty upon their towers, 
and in their cities, and to take up 
arms in defence of their country.

21 And thus Moroni put an end to 
those king-men, that there were not 
any  known  by  the  appellation  of 
king-men; and thus he put an end 
to the stubbornness and the pride 
of those people who professed the 
blood  of  nobility;  but  they  were 
brought  down  to  humble  them-
selves like unto their brethren, and 
to fight a valiantly for their freedom 
from bondage.

22 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
while  Moroni  was  thus  breaking 
down  the  wars  and  contentions 
among his own people, and subject-
ing them to peace and civilization, 
and making regulations to prepare 
for war against the Lamanites, be-
hold, the Lamanites had come into 
the a land of Moroni, which was in 
the borders by the seashore.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  were  not  sufficiently 
strong in the city of Moroni; there-
fore  Amalickiah  did  drive  them, 
slaying many. And it came to pass 
that Amalickiah took possession of 
the city, yea, possession of all their 
fortifications.

24 And those who fled out of the 
a city of Moroni came to the city of 
Nephihah; and also the people of 
the city of Lehi gathered themselves 
together,  and  made  preparations 
and were ready to receive the La-
manites to battle.
