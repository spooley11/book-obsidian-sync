these wonders should come to pass 
upon  all  the  face  of  this  land,  to 
the intent that there should be no 
cause for unbelief among the chil-

whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it

ye  are  permitted  to  act  for  your-
selves; for behold, God hath given 
unto you a c knowledge and he hath  
made you free.
