appointed  was  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla,  and  the  land  which  was 
between  the  land  Zarahemla  and 
the  land  b Bountiful,  yea,  to  the 
line which was between the c land 
Bountiful and the land Desolation.
24 And there were a great many 
thousand people who were called 
Nephites,  who  did  gather  them-
selves  together  in  this  land.  Now 
Lachoneus  did  cause  that  they 
should gather themselves together 
in the land a southward, because of 
the great curse which was upon the 
b land northward.

25 And they did fortify themselves 
against their enemies; and they did 
dwell in one land, and in one body, 
and they did fear the words which 
had  been  spoken  by  Lachoneus, 
insomuch that they did repent of 
all their sins; and they did put up 
their a prayers unto the Lord their 
God, that he would deliver them in 
the time that their enemies should 
come down against them to battle.
26 And they were exceedingly sor-
rowful  because  of  their  enemies. 
And Gidgiddoni did cause that they 
should make a weapons of war of ev-
ery kind, and they should be strong 
with armor, and with shields, and 
with bucklers, after the manner of 
his instruction.

CHAPTER 4

The Nephite armies defeat the Gadian-
ton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his 
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The 
Nephites praise the Lord for their vic-
tories. About a.d. 19–22.
And it came to pass that in the lat-
ter end of the eighteenth year those 
armies  of   a robbers  had  prepared 
for battle, and began to come down 
and  to  sally  forth  from  the  hills, 
and out of the mountains, and the

wilderness, and their strongholds, 
and  their  b secret  places,  and  be-
gan to take possession of the lands, 
both which were in the land south 
and which were in the land north,  
and began to take possession of all 
the lands which had been c deserted 
by the Nephites, and the cities which 
had been left desolate.

2 But behold, there were no wild 
beasts  nor  a game  in  those  lands 
which  had  been  deserted  by  the 
Nephites,  and  there  was  no  game 
for the robbers save it were in the 
wilderness.
