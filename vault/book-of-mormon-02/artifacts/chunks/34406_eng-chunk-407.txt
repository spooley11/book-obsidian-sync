save it were skin which was girded 
about  their  loins,  and  also  their  
armor,  which  was  girded  about 
them,  and  their  bows,  and  their 
arrows, and their stones, and their 
slings, and so forth.

6 And the skins of the Lamanites 
were dark, according to the mark 
which was set upon their fathers, 
which was a a curse upon them be-
cause  of  their  transgression  and 
their rebellion against their breth-
ren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, 
and Joseph, and Sam, who were just 
and holy men.

7 And  their  brethren  sought  to 
destroy them, therefore they were 
cursed;  and  the  Lord  God  set  a 
a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman 
and  Lemuel,  and  also  the  sons  of 
Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.
8 And this was done that their seed 
might  be  distinguished  from  the  
seed of their brethren, that thereby 
the  Lord  God  might  preserve  his 
people,  that  they  might  not  a mix 
and believe in incorrect b traditions 
which would prove their destruction.
9 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did mingle his seed with that 
of the Lamanites did bring the same 
curse upon his seed.

10 Therefore, whosoever suffered 
himself to be led away by the La-
manites  was  called  under  that 
head,  and  there  was  a  mark  set  
upon him.

11 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever would not believe in the a tradi-
tion of the Lamanites, but believed 
those records which were brought 
out of the land of Jerusalem, and 
also in the tradition of their fathers, 
which were correct, who believed 
in the commandments of God and 
kept them, were b called the Neph-
ites, or the people of Nephi, from 
that time forth—

12 And it is they who have kept 
the records which are a true of their 
people,  and  also  of  the  people  of 
the Lamanites.
