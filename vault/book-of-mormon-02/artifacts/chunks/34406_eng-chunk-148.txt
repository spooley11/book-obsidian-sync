corruption could not put on incor-
ruption. Wherefore, the c first judg-
ment which came upon man must  
needs have d remained to an endless  
duration. And if so, this flesh must 
have laid down to rot and to crumble 
to its mother earth, to rise no more.
8 O the a wisdom of God, his b mercy 
and c grace! For behold, if the d flesh 
should rise no more our spirits must 
become subject to that angel who 
e fell  from  before  the  presence  of 
the  Eternal  God,  and  became  the 
f devil, to rise no more.

9 And  our  spirits  must  have  
become a like unto him, and we be-
come devils, b angels to a c devil, to 
be  d shut out from the presence of 
our  God,  and  to  remain  with  the 
father of e lies, in misery, like unto 
himself;  yea,  to  that  being  who 
f  beguiled  our  first  parents,  who 
g transformeth himself nigh unto an 
h angel of light, and i stirreth up the 
children of men unto j secret combi-
nations of murder and all manner 
of secret works of darkness.

10 O how great the  a goodness of 
our God, who prepareth a way for 
our b escape from the grasp of this 
awful monster; yea, that monster,  
c death  and  d hell,  which  I  call  the 
death of the body, and also the death  
of the spirit.

11 And  because  of  the  way  of 
a deliverance of our God, the Holy 
One of Israel, this b death, of which 
I have spoken, which is the tempo-
ral, shall deliver up its dead; which 
death is the grave.
