4 And I know, O Lord, that thou 
hast all  a power, and can do what-
soever thou wilt for the benefit of 
man; therefore touch these stones, O 
Lord, with thy b finger, and prepare 
them that they may shine forth in 
darkness; and they shall shine forth 
unto  us  in  the  vessels  which  we 
have prepared, that we may have 
c light while we shall cross the sea.
5 Behold,  O  Lord,  thou  canst  do 
this.  We  know  that  thou  art  able 
to  show  forth  great  power,  which 
a looks small unto the understand-
ing of men.

6 And it came to pass that when 
the brother of Jared had said these 
words, behold, the a Lord stretched 
forth  his  hand  and  touched  the 
stones one by one with his b finger. 
And the c veil was taken from off the 
eyes of the brother of Jared, and he 
saw the finger of the Lord; and it 
was as the finger of a man, like unto 
flesh and blood; and the brother of 
Jared  d fell  down  before  the  Lord, 
for he was struck with e fear.

7 And  the  Lord  saw  that  the 
brother of Jared had fallen to the 
earth; and the Lord said unto him: 
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

8 And  he  saith  unto  the  Lord:  I 
saw  the  finger  of  the  Lord,  and  
I feared lest he should  a smite me; 
for  I  knew  not  that  the  Lord  had 
flesh and blood.

9 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
Because of thy faith thou hast seen 
that I shall take upon me a flesh and 
blood; and never has man come be-

as thou hast; for were it not so ye
