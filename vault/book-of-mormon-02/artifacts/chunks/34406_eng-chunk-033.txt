plates,  for  I  desire  the  room  that 
I may write of the things of God.

4 For the fulness of mine intent is 
that I may a persuade men to b come 
unto the God of Abraham, and the 
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, 
and be saved.

5 Wherefore,  the  things  which 
are  a pleasing unto the world I do 
not write, but the things which are 
pleasing unto God and unto those 
who are not of the world.

6 Wherefore,  I  shall  give  com-
mandment unto my seed, that they 
shall not occupy these plates with 
things which are not of worth unto 
the children of men.

CHAPTER 7
Lehi’s  sons  return  to  Jerusalem  and  
invite  Ishmael  and  his  household  to  
join  them  in  their  journey—Laman 
and  others  rebel—Nephi  exhorts  his  
brethren  to  have  faith  in  the  Lord—
They bind him with cords and plan his  
destruction—He is freed by the power 
of faith—His brethren ask forgiveness—
Lehi  and  his  company  offer  sacrifice 
and burnt offerings. About 600–592 b.c.

And  now  I  would  that  ye  might 
know,  that  after  my  father,  Lehi, 
had made an end of a prophesying 
concerning his seed, it came to pass 
that the Lord spake unto him again, 
saying that it was not meet for him, 
Lehi, that he should take his fam-
ily into the wilderness alone; but 
that  his  sons  should  take  b daugh-
ters to c wife, that they might raise 
up d seed unto the Lord in the land  
of promise.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord 
a commanded him that I, Nephi, and 
my brethren, should again return 
unto  the  land  of  Jerusalem,  and

bring down Ishmael and his family 
into the wilderness.

3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
did  a again,  with  my  brethren,  go 
forth into the wilderness to go up 
to Jerusalem.

4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we  
went up unto the house of Ishmael, 
and we did gain favor in the sight 
of Ishmael, insomuch that we did 
speak  unto  him  the  words  of  the  
Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the a Lord 
did  soften  the  heart  of  Ishmael, 
and also his household, insomuch 
that they took their journey with 
us down into the wilderness to the 
tent of our father.
