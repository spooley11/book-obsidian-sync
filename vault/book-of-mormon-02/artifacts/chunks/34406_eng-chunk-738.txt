29 But behold, it came to pass that 
in that same year they were driven 
back  even  into  their  own  lands. 
And thus ended the eightieth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.

30 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement of the eighty and 
first year they did go forth again 
against  this  band  of  robbers,  and 
did  destroy  many;  and  they  were 
also visited with much destruction.
31 And they were again obliged to 
return out of the wilderness and out 
of the a mountains unto their own 
lands,  because  of  the  exceeding 
greatness of the numbers of those 
robbers who infested the mountains 
and the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that thus 
ended  this  year.  And  the  robbers 
did still increase and wax strong, 
insomuch  that  they  did  defy  the 
whole armies of the Nephites, and 
also of the Lamanites; and they did 
cause great fear to come unto the 
people upon all the face of the land.
33 Yea,  for  they  did  visit  many 
parts of the land, and did do great 
destruction unto them; yea, did kill 
many,  and  did  carry  away  others 
captive  into  the  wilderness,  yea, 
and more especially their women 
and their children.

34 Now this great evil, which came 
unto  the  people  because  of  their 
iniquity, did stir them up again in 
a remembrance of the Lord their God.
35 And thus ended the eighty and 
first year of the reign of the judges.

36 And in the eighty and second 
year they began again to a forget the 
Lord their God. And in the eighty 
and third year they began to wax 
strong in iniquity. And in the eighty 
and fourth year they did not mend 
their ways.

37 And it came to pass in the eighty 
and fifth year they did wax stron-
ger and stronger in their pride, and 
in their wickedness; and thus they  
were a ripening again for destruction.
38 And thus ended the eighty and

fifth year.

CHAPTER 12

Men  are  unstable  and  foolish  and 
quick  to  do  evil—The  Lord  chastens 
His people—The nothingness of men is 
compared with the power of God—In 
the day of judgment, men will gain ev-
erlasting life or everlasting damnation.
