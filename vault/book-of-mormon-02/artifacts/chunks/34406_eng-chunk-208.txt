13 And there is a none other which 
shall view it, save it be a few accord-
ing to the will of God, to bear testi-
mony of his word unto the children 
of men; for the Lord God hath said 
that the words of the faithful should 
speak as if it were b from the dead.
14 Wherefore, the Lord God will 
proceed  to  bring  forth  the  words 
of the book; and in the mouth of 
as many witnesses as seemeth him 
good will he establish his word; and 
wo be unto him that a rejecteth the 
word of God!

15 But  behold,  it  shall  come  to 
pass  that  the  Lord  God  shall  say 
unto him to whom he shall deliver

the book: Take these words which 
are not sealed and deliver them to 
another,  that  he  may  show  them 
unto the learned, saying: a Read this, 
I pray thee. And the learned shall 
say:  Bring  hither  the  book,  and  I 
will read them.

16 And now, because of the glory 
of the world and to get  a gain will 
they say this, and not for the glory 
of God.

17 And the man shall say: I can-
not bring the book, for it is sealed.
18 Then  shall  the  learned  say:  I

cannot read it.

19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, 
that the Lord God will a deliver again 
the book and the words thereof to 
him  that  is  not  learned;  and  the 
man that is not learned shall say: 
I am not learned.

20 Then  shall  the  Lord  God  say 
unto him: The learned shall not read  
them, for they have rejected them, 
and I am a able to do mine own work; 
wherefore thou shalt read the words 
which I shall give unto thee.

21 a Touch not the things which are 
sealed, for I will bring them forth in 
mine own due time; for I will show 
unto the children of men that I am 
able to do mine own work.
