23 And now Limhi told the king 
all the things concerning his father, 
and the a priests that had fled into 
the wilderness, and attributed the 
carrying  away  of  their  daughters 
to them.

24 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king was pacified towards his peo-
ple; and he said unto them: Let us 
go forth to meet my people, without 
arms; and I swear unto you with an 
a oath that my people shall not slay 
thy people.

25 And it came to pass that they 
followed the king, and went forth 
without arms to meet the Laman-
ites. And it came to pass that they 
did  meet  the  Lamanites;  and  the 
king  of  the  Lamanites  did  bow 
himself down before them, and did 
plead  in  behalf  of  the  people  of  
Limhi.

26 And when the Lamanites saw 
the people of Limhi, that they were 
without arms, they had a compassion 
on them and were pacified towards 
them, and returned with their king 
in peace to their own land.

MOSIAH 21  : 1–15

CHAPTER 21

Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated 
by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet 
Ammon and are converted—They tell 
Ammon  of  the  twenty- four  Jaredite 
plates. About 122–121 b.c.

And it came to pass that Limhi and 
his people returned to the city of 
Nephi, and began to dwell in the 
land again in peace.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
many  days  the  Lamanites  began 
again  to  be  stirred  up  in  anger 
against the Nephites, and they be-
gan to come into the borders of the 
land round about.

3 Now they durst not slay them, 
because  of  the  a oath  which  their 
king had made unto Limhi; but they 
would smite them on their b cheeks, 
and exercise authority over them; 
and began to put heavy  c burdens 
upon their backs, and drive them 
as they would a dumb ass—

4 Yea, all this was done that the 
a word  of  the  Lord  might  be  b ful-
filled.
