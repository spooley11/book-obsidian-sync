7 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to cry unto the people, saying: 
Behold, I am a guilty, and these men 
are  spotless  before  God.  And  he 
began to plead for them from that 
time  forth;  but  they  reviled  him, 
saying: Art thou also possessed with 
the devil? And they spit upon him, 
and b cast him out from among them, 
and also all those who believed in 
the words which had been spoken 
by  Alma  and  Amulek;  and  they 
cast them out, and sent men to cast 
stones at them.

8 And  they  brought  their  wives 
and children together, and whoso-
ever  believed  or  had  been  taught 
to believe in the word of God they 
caused  that  they  should  be  a cast 
into the fire; and they also brought 
forth their records which contained 
the holy scriptures, and cast them 
into the fire also, that they might 
be b burned and destroyed by fire.
9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
took Alma and Amulek, and carried 
them forth to the place of a martyr-
dom, that they might witness the 
destruction of those who were con-
sumed by fire.

10 And  when  Amulek  saw  the 
pains of the women and children 
who were consuming in the fire, he 
also was pained; and he said unto 
Alma: How can we witness this aw-
ful scene? Therefore let us stretch 
forth our hands, and exercise the 
a power of God which is in us, and 
save them from the flames.

11 But Alma said unto him: The 
Spirit constraineth me that I must 
not  stretch  forth  mine  hand;  for 
behold the Lord receiveth them up
