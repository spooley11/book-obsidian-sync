12 Yea, and how is it that ye have 
forgotten  that  the  Lord  is  able  to 
do all a things according to his will, 
for the children of men, if it so be 
that  they  exercise  b faith  in  him? 
Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.
13 And if it so be that we are faith-
ful to him, we shall obtain the a land 
of  promise;  and  ye  shall  know  at 
some future period that the word of 
the Lord shall be fulfilled concern-
ing the b destruction of c Jerusalem;  
for all things which the Lord hath 
spoken concerning the destruction 
of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

14 For  behold,  the  a Spirit  of  the 
Lord  b ceaseth  soon  to  strive  with 
them;  for  behold,  they  have  c re-
jected the prophets, and d Jeremiah 
have they cast into prison. And they 
have sought to take away the e life 
of  my  father,  insomuch  that  they 
have driven him out of the land.

15 Now behold, I say unto you that 
if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye 
shall  also  perish  with  them.  And 
now,  if  ye  have  choice,  go  up  to 
the land, and remember the words 
which I speak unto you, that if ye 
go ye will also perish; for thus the 
Spirit of the Lord constraineth me 
that I should speak.

16 And it came to pass that when 
I,  Nephi,  had  spoken  these  words 
unto my brethren, they were angry 
with me. And it came to pass that 
they did lay their hands upon me, 
for behold, they were exceedingly 
wroth, and they did a bind me with

cords, for they sought to take away 
my life, that they might leave me 
in  the  wilderness  to  be  devoured 
by wild beasts.

17 But it came to pass that I prayed 
unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, ac-
cording to my faith which is in thee, 
wilt thou deliver me from the hands 
of my brethren; yea, even give me 
a strength  that  I  may  b burst  these 
bands with which I am bound.

18 And it came to pass that when 
I had said these words, behold, the 
bands  were  loosed  from  off  my 
hands and feet, and I stood before 
my brethren, and I spake unto them  
again.
