us? Yea, and even it shall be our-
selves if we do not stand fast in the 
faith of Christ.

28 And now it came to pass that 
when Moroni had said these words 
he went forth, and also sent forth 
in all the parts of the land where 
there were dissensions, and gathered 
together  all  the  people  who  were 
desirous to maintain their liberty, 
to  stand  against  Amalickiah  and 
those who had dissented, who were 
called Amalickiahites.

29 And it came to pass that when 
Amalickiah saw that the people of 
Moroni were more numerous than 
the  Amalickiahites—and  he  also 
saw that his people were a doubtful 
concerning the justice of the cause 
in  which  they  had  undertaken—
therefore,  fearing  that  he  should 
not gain the point, he took those of 
his people who would and departed 
into the b land of Nephi.

30 Now Moroni thought it was not 
expedient that the Lamanites should 
have any more a strength; therefore 
he thought to cut off the people of 
Amalickiah,  or  to  take  them  and 
bring them back, and put Amalick-
iah to death; yea, for he knew that 
he would stir up the Lamanites to 
anger against them, and cause them 
to  come  to  battle  against  them; 
and this he knew that Amalickiah 
would do that he might obtain his  
purposes.

31 Therefore  Moroni  thought  it  
was  expedient  that  he  should  
take his armies, who had gathered 
themselves  together,  and  armed 
themselves, and entered into a cov-
enant  to  keep  the  peace—and  it 
came to pass that he took his army 
and marched out with his tents into 
the wilderness, to cut off the course 
of Amalickiah in the wilderness.
