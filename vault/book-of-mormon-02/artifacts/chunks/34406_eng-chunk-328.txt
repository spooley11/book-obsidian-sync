20 And it came to pass that there 
was a man among them whose name 
was  a Abinadi;  and  he  went  forth 
among them, and began to proph-
esy, saying: Behold, thus saith the 
Lord, and thus hath he commanded 
me, saying, Go forth, and say unto 
this people, thus saith the Lord—
Wo be unto this people, for I have 
seen their abominations, and their 
wickedness, and their whoredoms; 
and except they repent I will b visit 
them in mine anger.

21 And  except  they  repent  and 
turn to the Lord their God, behold, 
I will deliver them into the hands 
of their enemies; yea, and they shall 
be brought into a bondage; and they 
shall  be  afflicted  by  the  hand  of 
their enemies.

22 And it shall come to pass that

they shall a know that I am the Lord 
their God, and am a b jealous God, 
visiting the iniquities of my people.
23 And it shall come to pass that 
except this people repent and turn 
unto the Lord their God, they shall 
be brought into bondage; and none 
shall a deliver them, except it be the 
Lord the Almighty God.

24 Yea, and it shall come to pass 
that when they shall a cry unto me 
I will be  b slow to hear their cries; 
yea, and I will suffer them that they 
be smitten by their enemies.

25 And except they repent in a sack-
cloth and ashes, and cry mightily to 
the Lord their God, I will not b hear 
their prayers, neither will I deliver 
them  out  of  their  afflictions;  and 
thus saith the Lord, and thus hath 
he commanded me.

26 Now it came to pass that when 
Abinadi  had  spoken  these  words 
unto  them  they  were  wroth  with 
him, and sought to take away his 
life;  but  the  Lord  a delivered  him 
out of their hands.

27 Now when king Noah had heard 
of  the  words  which  Abinadi  had 
spoken unto the people, he was also 
wroth; and he said: a Who is Abin-
adi, that I and my people should be 
judged of him, or b who is the Lord, 
that  shall  bring  upon  my  people 
such great affliction?
