9 And the men of Pachus received 
their trial, according to the law, and 
also those king-men who had been 
taken  and  a cast  into  prison;  and 
they  were  b executed  according  to 
the law; yea, those men of Pachus 
and  those  c king-men,  whosoever 
would not take up arms in the de-
fence of their country, but would 
fight against it, were put to death.
10 And thus it became expedient 
that this law should be strictly ob-
served for the safety of their coun-
try; yea, and whosoever was found 
denying their freedom was speed-
ily a executed according to the law.
11 And  thus  ended  the  thirtieth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the  people  of  Nephi;  Moroni  and 
Pahoran having restored peace to 
the land of Zarahemla, among their 
own people, having a inflicted death 
upon all those who were not true 
to the cause of freedom.

12 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  
commencement  of  the  thirty  and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, Moroni 
immediately caused that provisions 
should  be  sent,  and  also  an  army 
of six thousand men should be sent 
unto Helaman, to assist him in pre-
serving that part of the land.

13 And  he  also  caused  that  an

army of six thousand men, with a 
sufficient quantity of food, should 
be sent to the armies of Lehi and 
Teancum. And it came to pass that 
this  was  done  to  fortify  the  land 
against the Lamanites.

14 And it came to pass that Moroni 
and Pahoran, leaving a large body of 
men in the land of Zarahemla, took 
their  march  with  a  large  body  of 
men towards the land of Nephihah, 
being determined to a overthrow the 
Lamanites in that city.

15 And it came to pass that as they 
were  marching  towards  the  land, 
they  took  a  large  body  of  men  of 
the  Lamanites,  and  slew  many  of 
them, and took their provisions and 
their weapons of war.
