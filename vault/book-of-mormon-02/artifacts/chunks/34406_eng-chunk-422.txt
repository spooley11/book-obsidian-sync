52 And  again  I  say  unto  you, 
the Spirit saith: Behold, the a ax is  
laid at the root of the tree; there-
fore  every  tree  that  bringeth  not 
forth  good  fruit  shall  be  b hewn 
down  and  cast  into  the  fire,  yea, 
a fire which cannot be consumed, 
even an unquenchable fire. Behold, 
and remember, the Holy One hath 
spoken it.

53 And now my beloved brethren, 
I  say  unto  you,  can  ye  withstand 
these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside 
these things, and a trample the Holy 
One under your feet; yea, can ye be 
b puffed up in the pride of your hearts;  
yea, will ye still persist in the wear-
ing  of  c costly  apparel  and  setting 
your  hearts  upon  the  vain  things 
of the world, upon your d riches?

54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing 
that ye are better one than another; 
yea, will ye persist in the persecu-
tion of your brethren, who humble 
themselves and do walk after the 
holy order of God, wherewith they 
have been brought into this church, 
having been a sanctified by the Holy 
Spirit, and they do bring forth works 
which are meet for repentance—

55 Yea,  and  will  you  persist  in 
turning your backs upon the a poor, 
and the needy, and in withholding 
your substance from them?

56 And finally, all ye that will per-
sist in your wickedness, I say unto 
you that these are they who shall 
be  hewn  down  and  cast  into  the 
fire except they speedily repent.

57 And  now  I  say  unto  you,  all 
you that are desirous to follow the 
voice of the a good shepherd, come 
ye  out  from  the  wicked,  and  be 
ye  b separate,  and  touch  not  their 
unclean things; and behold, their 
names  shall  be  c blotted  out,  that 
the names of the wicked shall not 
be  numbered  among  the  names 
of the righteous, that the word of 
God may be fulfilled, which saith: 
The  names  of  the  wicked  shall 
not be mingled with the names of  
my people;
