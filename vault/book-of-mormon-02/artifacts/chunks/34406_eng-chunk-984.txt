3 Behold, I would exhort you that 
when ye shall read these things, if 
it be wisdom in God that ye should 
read them, that ye would remember 
how a merciful the Lord hath been 
unto the children of men, from the  
creation of Adam even down until  
the time that ye shall receive these 
things, and b ponder it in your c hearts.
4 And when ye shall receive these 
things, I would exhort you that ye 
would a ask God, the Eternal Father,  
in the name of Christ, if these things 
are  not  b true;  and  if  ye  shall  ask 
with a c sincere heart, with d real in-
tent, having e faith in Christ, he will 
f manifest the g truth of it unto you, 
by the power of the Holy Ghost.
