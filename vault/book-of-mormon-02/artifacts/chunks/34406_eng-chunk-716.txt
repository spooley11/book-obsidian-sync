26 Now behold, those a secret oaths 
and covenants did not come forth 
unto Gadianton from the b records 
which were delivered unto Helaman; 
but behold, they were put into the  
heart of   c Gadianton by that d same be-
ing who did entice our first parents  
to partake of the forbidden fruit—
27 Yea, that same being who did 
plot  with  a Cain,  that  if  he  would 
murder his brother Abel it should 
not be known unto the world. And 
he did plot with Cain and his fol-
lowers from that time forth.

28 And also it is that same being 
who  put  it  into  the  hearts  of  the 
people to a build a tower sufficiently 
high that they might get to heaven. 
And it was that same being who led 
on the people who came from that 
tower  into  this  land;  who  spread 
the works of darkness and abomi-
nations over all the face of the land, 
until he dragged the people down 
to an b entire destruction, and to an 
everlasting hell.

29 Yea, it is that same being who 
put it into the heart of a Gadianton 
to still carry on the work of dark-
ness, and of secret murder; and he 
has brought it forth from the begin-
ning of man even down to this time.
30 And behold, it is he who is the 
a author of all sin. And behold, he 
doth carry on his works of darkness

and secret murder, and doth hand 
down their plots, and their oaths, 
and their covenants, and their plans 
of awful wickedness, from genera-
tion to generation according as he 
can get hold upon the hearts of the 
children of men.

31 And  now  behold,  he  had  got 
great hold upon the hearts of the 
Nephites; yea, insomuch that they 
had become exceedingly wicked; yea, 
the more part of them had turned 
out  of  the  a way  of  righteousness,  
and did b trample under their feet 
the commandments of God, and did  
turn  unto  their  own  ways,  and  
did build up unto themselves c idols 
of their gold and their silver.
