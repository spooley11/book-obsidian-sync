13 And it came to pass that there 
was  no  contention  among  all  the  
people,  in  all  the  land;  but  there 
were  mighty  miracles  wrought 
among the disciples of Jesus.

14 And it came to pass that the sev-
enty and first year passed away, and 
also the seventy and second year, 
yea, and in fine, till the seventy and 
ninth  year  had  passed  away;  yea, 
even an hundred years had passed 
away,  and  the  a disciples  of  Jesus, 
whom he had chosen, had all gone to 
the b paradise of God, save it were the  
c three who should tarry; and there 
were other d disciples e ordained in 
their stead; and also many of that 
f generation had passed away.

15 And it came to pass that there 
was no a contention in the land, be-
cause of the b love of God which did 
dwell in the hearts of the people.

16 And there were no  a envyings, 
nor b strifes, nor c tumults, nor whore-
doms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor 
any manner of d lasciviousness; and 
surely  there  could  not  be  a  e hap-
pier people among all the people 
who had been created by the hand  
of God.

17 There  were  no  robbers,  nor 
murderers, neither were there La-
manites, nor any manner of -ites; 
but they were in a one, the children 
of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom 
of God.

18 And how blessed were they! For 
the Lord did bless them in all their 
doings; yea, even they were blessed 
and  prospered  until  an  hundred 
and ten years had passed away; and 
the  first  generation  from  Christ 
had passed away, and there was no  
contention in all the land.

19 And it came to pass that a Nephi, 
he that kept this last record, (and he 
kept it upon the b plates of Nephi) 
died, and his son Amos kept it in 
his stead; and he kept it upon the 
plates of Nephi also.

20 And he kept it eighty and four 
years, and there was still peace in 
the land, save it were a small part  
of the people who had revolted from 
the  church  and  taken  upon  them 
the name of Lamanites; therefore 
there began to be a Lamanites again 
in the land.
