27 And I exhort you to remember 
these things; for the time speedily 
cometh  that  ye  shall  know  that  I 
lie not, for ye shall see me at the 
bar of God; and the Lord God will 
say unto you: Did I not declare my 
a words unto you, which were writ-
ten by this man, like as one  b cry-
ing from the dead, yea, even as one 
speaking out of the c dust?

28 I declare these things unto the 
fulfilling  of  the  prophecies.  And 
behold,  they  shall  proceed  forth 
out of the mouth of the everlasting 
God; and his word shall a hiss forth 
from generation to generation.

29 And God shall show unto you, 
that  that  which  I  have  written  is 
a true.

30 And again I would exhort you 
that  ye  would  a come  unto  Christ, 
and lay hold upon every good b gift, 
and c touch not the evil gift, nor the 
d unclean thing.

31 And a awake, and arise from the 
dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on 
thy beautiful garments, O daugh-

ter  of  b Zion;  and  c strengthen  thy 
d stakes and enlarge thy borders for-
ever, that thou mayest e no more be 
confounded, that the covenants of 
the Eternal Father which he hath 
made unto thee, O house of Israel, 
may be fulfilled.

32 Yea, a come unto Christ, and be 
b perfected in him, and c deny your-
selves of all ungodliness; and if ye 
shall deny yourselves of all ungod-
liness, and d love God with all your 
might, mind and strength, then is 
his  grace  sufficient  for  you,  that 
by his grace ye may be e perfect in 
Christ; and if by the grace of God 
ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in 
nowise deny the power of God.

33 And again, if ye by the grace of 
God are perfect in Christ, and deny 
not his power, then are ye a sancti-
fied in Christ by the grace of God, 
through the shedding of the b blood 
of Christ, which is in the covenant  
of the Father unto the remission of  
your  c sins,  that  ye  become  d holy, 
without spot.
