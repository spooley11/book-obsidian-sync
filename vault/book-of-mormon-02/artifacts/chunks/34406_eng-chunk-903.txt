12 Behold, he created Adam, and 
by  a Adam  came  the  b fall  of  man. 
And because of the fall of man came 
Jesus  Christ,  even  the  Father  and 
the Son; and because of Jesus Christ  
came the c redemption of man.

13 And  because  of  the  redemp-
tion of man, which came by Jesus 
Christ, they are brought back into

the a presence of the Lord; yea, this 
is wherein all men are redeemed, 
because the death of Christ bringeth 
to  pass  the  b resurrection,  which 
bringeth to pass a redemption from 
an endless c sleep, from which sleep 
all men shall be awakened by the 
power of God when the trump shall 
sound; and they shall come forth, 
both small and great, and all shall 
stand  before  his  bar,  being  re-
deemed and loosed from this eter-
nal d band of death, which death is a  
temporal death.

14 And then cometh the a judgment 
of  the  Holy  One  upon  them;  and 
then cometh the time that he that 
is  b filthy  shall  be  filthy  still;  and 
he that is righteous shall be righ-
teous still; he that is happy shall be 
happy still; and he that is unhappy 
shall be unhappy still.

15 And  now,  O  all  ye  that  have 
imagined up unto yourselves a god 
who can do  a no miracles, I would 
ask  of  you,  have  all  these  things 
passed, of which I have spoken? Has 
the end come yet? Behold I say unto 
you, Nay; and God has not ceased 
to be a God of miracles.

16 Behold, are not the things that 
God hath wrought marvelous in our 
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend 
the marvelous a works of God?

17 Who shall say that it was not 
a  miracle  that  by  his  a word  the 
heaven and the earth should be; and 
by the power of his word man was 
b created of the  c dust of the earth; 
and by the power of his word have 
miracles been wrought?
