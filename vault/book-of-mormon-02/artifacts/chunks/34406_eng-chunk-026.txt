4 Now  when  I  had  spoken  these 
words, they were yet wroth, and did  
still continue to murmur; neverthe-
less they did follow me up until we 
came without the walls of Jerusalem.
5 And it was by night; and I caused 
that  they  should  hide  themselves 
without the walls. And after they 
had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept 
into the city and went forth towards 
the house of Laban.

6 And I was a led by the Spirit, not 
b knowing  beforehand  the  things 
which I should do.

7 Nevertheless  I  went  forth,  and 
as  I  came  near  unto  the  house  of 
Laban I beheld a man, and he had 
fallen to the earth before me, for 
he was a drunken with wine.

8 And when I came to him I found

that it was Laban.

9 And  I  beheld  his  a sword,  and 
I  drew  it  forth  from  the  sheath 
thereof;  and  the  hilt  thereof  was 
of pure gold, and the workmanship 
thereof was exceedingly fine, and 
I saw that the blade thereof was of 
the most precious steel.

10 And it came to pass that I was 
a constrained  by  the  Spirit  that  I 
should kill Laban; but I said in my 
heart: Never at any time have I shed 
the blood of man. And I shrunk and 
would that I might not slay him.

11 And  the  Spirit  said  unto  me 
again: Behold the a Lord hath b deliv-
ered him into thy hands. Yea, and 
I also knew that he had sought to 
take away mine own life; yea, and 
he  would  not  hearken  unto  the 
commandments of the Lord; and he 
also had c taken away our property.
12 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, 
for  the  Lord  hath  delivered  him 
into thy hands;

13 Behold  the  Lord  a slayeth  the 
b wicked  to  bring  forth  his  righ-
teous  purposes.  It  is  c better  that 
one man should perish than that a 
nation should dwindle and perish 
in d unbelief.

14 And now, when I, Nephi, had 
heard these words, I remembered 
the  words  of  the  Lord  which  he 
spake  unto  me  in  the  wilderness, 
saying that: a Inasmuch as thy seed 
shall  keep  my  b commandments, 
they shall c prosper in the d land of 
promise.
