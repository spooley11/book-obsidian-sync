and  tents,  and  a departed  into  the 
wilderness.

5 And he came down by the bor-
ders near the shore of the a Red Sea; 
and he traveled in the wilderness 
in the borders which are nearer the 
Red Sea; and he did travel in the 
wilderness with his family, which 
consisted  of  my  mother,  Sariah, 
and my elder brothers, who were 
Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

6 And it came to pass that when he 
had traveled three days in the wilder-
ness, he pitched his tent in a a valley 
by the side of a b river of water.

7 And it came to pass that he built 
an  a altar  of  b stones,  and  made  an 
c offering unto the Lord, and gave 
d thanks unto the Lord our God.
