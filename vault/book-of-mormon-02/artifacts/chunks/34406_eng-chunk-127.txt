my mouth unto their brethren who 
are the fruit of thy loins; and the 
weakness of their words will I make 
strong in their faith, unto the re-
membering of my covenant which 
I made unto thy fathers.

22 And  now,  behold,  my  son  Jo-
seph,  after  this  manner  did  my 
father of old a prophesy.

23 Wherefore, because of this cov-
enant thou art a blessed; for thy seed  
shall not be destroyed, for they shall  
b hearken unto the words of the book.
24 And  there  shall  rise  up  a one 
mighty among them, who shall do 
much  good,  both  in  word  and  in 
deed,  being  an  instrument  in  the 
hands of God, with exceeding faith, 
to  work  mighty  wonders,  and  do 
that thing which is great in the sight 
of God, unto the bringing to pass 
much  b restoration unto the house 
of Israel, and unto the seed of thy  
brethren.

25 And  now,  blessed  art  thou, 
Joseph.  Behold,  thou  art  little; 
wherefore hearken unto the words 
of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall 
be done unto thee even according 
to the words which I have spoken. 
Remember the words of thy dying 
father. Amen.

CHAPTER 4
Lehi  counsels  and  blesses  his  poster-
ity—He  dies  and  is  buried—Nephi 
glories in the goodness of God—Nephi 
puts his trust in the Lord forever. About 
588–570 b.c.
And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning 
the prophecies of which my father 
hath  spoken,  concerning  a Joseph, 
who was carried into Egypt.

2 For  behold,  he  truly  prophe-
sied  concerning  all  his  seed.  And 
the  a prophecies  which  he  wrote, 
there are not many greater. And he 
prophe sied concerning us, and our 
future  generations;  and  they  are 
written upon the b plates of brass.

3 Wherefore, after my father had 
made an end of speaking concerning 
the prophecies of Joseph, he called 
the children of Laman, his sons, and 
his daughters, and said unto them: 
Behold, my sons, and my daughters, 
who  are  the  sons  and  the  daugh-
ters of my a firstborn, I would that 
ye should give ear unto my words.
4 For the Lord God hath said that: 
a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my com-
mandments ye shall prosper in the 
land; and inasmuch as ye will not 
keep my commandments ye shall 
be cut off from my presence.
