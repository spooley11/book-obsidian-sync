16 And it came to pass that when 
it was night they were weary, and 
retired to their camps; and after they 
had retired to their camps they took 
up a howling and a a lamentation for 
the loss of the slain of their people; 
and so great were their cries, their 
howlings  and  lamentations,  that 
they did rend the air exceedingly.
17 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they did go again to bat-
tle, and great and terrible was that 
day; nevertheless, they conquered 
not, and when the night came again 
they  did  rend  the  air  with  their 
cries, and their howlings, and their 
mournings, for the loss of the slain 
of their people.

18 And it came to pass that Corian-

tumr  wrote  again  an  epistle  unto 
Shiz,  desiring  that  he  would  not 
come  again  to  battle,  but  that  he 
would take the kingdom, and spare 
the lives of the people.

19 But  behold,  the  a Spirit  of  the 
Lord had ceased striving with them, 
and  b Satan  had  full  power  over 
the c hearts of the people; for they 
were  given  up  unto  the  hardness  
of their hearts, and the blindness of  
their minds that they might be de-
stroyed; wherefore they went again 
to battle.

20 And it came to pass that they 
fought all that day, and when the 
night  came  they  slept  upon  their 
swords.

21 And on the morrow they fought

even until the night came.

22 And when the night came they 
were a drunken with anger, even as a 
man who is drunken with wine; and 
they slept again upon their swords.
23 And on the morrow they fought 
again; and when the night came they 
had all fallen by the sword save it 
were fifty and two of the people of 
Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of 
the people of Shiz.

24 And it came to pass that they 
slept upon their swords that night, 
and  on  the  morrow  they  fought 
again, and they contended in their 
might with their swords and with 
their shields, all that day.

25 And when the night came there 
were thirty and two of the people 
of  Shiz,  and  twenty  and  seven  of 
the people of Coriantumr.
