If ye teach the a law of Moses why 
do ye not keep it? Why do ye set 
your hearts upon b riches? Why do 
ye commit whoredoms and c spend 
your  strength  with  harlots,  yea, 
and  cause  this  people  to  commit 
sin, that the Lord has cause to send 
me to prophesy against this people, 
yea, even a great evil against this  
people?

30 Know ye not that I speak the 
a truth? Yea, ye know that I speak 
the truth; and you ought to tremble 
before God.

31 And it shall come to pass that 
ye shall be smitten for your iniqui-
ties, for ye have said that ye teach 
the law of Moses. And what know 
ye  concerning  the  law  of  Moses? 
a Doth  salvation  come  by  the  law 
of Moses? What say ye?

before me.

36 a Thou shalt not make unto thee 
any graven image, or any likeness of 
any thing in heaven above, or things 
which are in the earth beneath.

37 Now Abinadi said unto them, 
Have  ye  done  all  this?  I  say  unto 
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye 
a taught this people that they should 
do all these things? I say unto you, 
Nay, ye have not.

CHAPTER 13

Abinadi is protected by divine power—
He teaches the Ten Commandments—
Salvation does not come by the law of 
Moses alone—God Himself will make 
an atonement and redeem His people. 
About 148 b.c.

And now when the king had heard 
these words, he said unto his priests: 
Away with this fellow, and slay him;  
for what have we to do with him, for  
he is a mad.

2 And  they  stood  forth  and  at-
tempted to lay their hands on him; 
but  he  withstood  them,  and  said  
unto them:
