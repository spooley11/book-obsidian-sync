29 Rejoice not thou, whole Pales-
tina,  because  the  rod  of  him  that 
a smote  thee  is  broken;  for  out  of 
the serpent’s root shall come forth 
a cockatrice, and his b fruit shall be 
a c fiery flying serpent.

30 And the firstborn of the poor 
shall feed, and the needy shall lie 
down in safety; and I will kill thy 
root with famine, and he shall slay 
thy remnant.

31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, 
whole Palestina, art dissolved; for 
there shall come from the north a 
smoke, and none shall be alone in 
his appointed times.

32 What  shall  then  answer  the 
messengers  of  the  nations?  That  
the Lord hath founded a Zion, and 
the b poor of his people shall trust 
in it.

years  after  Lehi  left  Jerusalem—The 
Nephites  keep  the  law  of  Moses  and 
believe in Christ, who is the Holy One 
of Israel. About 559–545 b.c.

Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat 
concerning the words which I have 
written,  which  have  been  spoken
