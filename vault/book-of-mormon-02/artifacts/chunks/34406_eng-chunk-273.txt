already was. And after this manner 
did they teach them.

12 And it came to pass that by so 
doing they kept them from being 
a destroyed upon the face of the land; 
for they did b prick their hearts with 
the word, c continually stirring them 
up unto repentance.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and thirty and eight years 
had  passed  away—after  the  man-

dissensions, for the space of b much 
of the time.

14 And I, Jarom, do not write more, 
for the plates are a small. But behold, 
my brethren, ye can go to the b other 
plates of Nephi; for behold, upon 
them  the  records  of  our  wars  are

the  hands  of  my  son  Omni,  that 
they may be kept according to the  
a commandments of my fathers.

records—Mosiah  discovers  the  people 
of Zarahemla, who came from Jerusa-

made king over them—The descendants 
of Mulek at Zarahemla had discovered 
Coriantumr, the last of the Jaredites—
King Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men 
should offer their souls as an offering 
to Christ. About 323–130 b.c.

BEHOLD, it came to pass that I,

Omni,  being  commanded  by  
  my father, Jarom, that I should 
write somewhat upon a these plates, 
to preserve our genealogy—
