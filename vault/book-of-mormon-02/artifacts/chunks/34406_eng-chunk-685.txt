39 And thus ended the thirty and 
first year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi; and thus 
they had had wars, and bloodsheds, 
and famine, and affliction, for the 
space of many years.

40 And there had been murders,

and  contentions,  and  dissensions,  
and all manner of iniquity among 
the people of Nephi; nevertheless 
for the a righteous’ sake, yea, because 
of the prayers of the righteous, they 
were spared.

41 But behold, because of the ex-
ceedingly great length of the war 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites  many  had  become  hard-
ened,  because  of  the  exceedingly 
great length of the war; and many 
were softened because of their a af-
flictions,  insomuch  that  they  did 
humble themselves before God, even 
in the depth of humility.

42 And it came to pass that after 
Moroni had fortified those parts of 
the land which were most exposed 
to the Lamanites, until they were 
sufficiently strong, he returned to 
the city of Zarahemla; and also He-
laman returned to the place of his 
inheritance;  and  there  was  once 
more peace established among the 
people of Nephi.

43 And  Moroni  yielded  up  the 
a command  of  his  armies  into  the 
hands of his son, whose name was 
b Moronihah; and he retired to his 
own house that he might spend the 
remainder of his days in peace.

44 And Pahoran did return to his 
judgment-seat;  and  Helaman  did 
take upon him again to preach unto 
the  people  the  word  of  God;  for 
because of so many wars and con-
tentions it had become expedient 
that a a regulation should be made 
again in the church.

45 Therefore,  Helaman  and  his 
brethren  went  forth,  and  did  de-
clare the word of God with much 
power unto the a convincing of many 
people of their wickedness, which 
did cause them to repent of their 
sins  and  to  be  baptized  unto  the 
Lord their God.

46 And it came to pass that they 
did  establish  again  the  church  of 
God, throughout all the land.
