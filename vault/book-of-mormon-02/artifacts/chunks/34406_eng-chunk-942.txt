10 And  after  that  he  had  estab-
lished himself king he did ease the 
burden of the people, by which he 
did  gain  favor  in  the  eyes  of  the 
people,  and  they  did  anoint  him 
to be their king.

11 And  he  did  do  justice  unto 
the  people,  but  not  unto  himself 
because of his many a whoredoms; 
wherefore he was cut off from the 
presence of the Lord.

12 And it came to pass that Mori-
anton built up many cities, and the 
people  became  exceedingly  rich 
under his reign, both in buildings, 
and in a gold and silver, and in rais-
ing grain, and in flocks, and herds, 
and  such  things  which  had  been 
restored unto them.

13 And Morianton did live to an 
exceedingly great age, and then he 
begat  Kim;  and  Kim  did  reign  in 
the stead of his father; and he did 
reign  eight  years,  and  his  father 
died. And it came to pass that Kim 
did  a not  reign  in  righteousness,

wherefore  he  was  not  favored  of 
the Lord.

14 And his brother did rise up in 
rebellion against him, by which he 
did bring him into a captivity; and 
he did remain in captivity all his 
days; and he begat sons and daugh-
ters in captivity, and in his old age 
he begat Levi; and he died.

15 And it came to pass that Levi 
did  serve  in  captivity  after  the 
death  of  his  father,  for  the  space 
of forty and two years. And he did 
make war against the king of the 
land, by which he did obtain unto 
himself the kingdom.

16 And  after  he  had  obtained 
unto himself the kingdom he did 
that  which  was  right  in  the  sight 
of  the  Lord;  and  the  people  did 
prosper in the land; and he did live 
to a good a old age, and begat sons 
and  daughters;  and  he  also  begat 
Corom, whom he anointed king in  
his stead.
