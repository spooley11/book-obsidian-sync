44 And they were inspired by the 
a Zoramites and the Amalekites, who 
were their chief captains and lead-
ers, and by Zerahemnah, who was 
their  chief  captain,  or  their  chief 
leader and commander; yea, they did 
fight like dragons, and many of the 
Nephites were slain by their hands, 
yea, for they did smite in two many 
of their head-plates, and they did 
pierce many of their breastplates, 
and they did smite off many of their  
arms; and thus the Lamanites did 
smite in their fierce anger.

45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were 
inspired by a a better cause, for they 
were  not  b fighting  for  monarchy 
nor power but they were fighting 
for their homes and their c liberties,

their wives and their children, and 
their all, yea, for their rites of wor-
ship and their church.

46 And they were doing that which 
they felt was the a duty which they 
owed to their God; for the Lord had 
said unto them, and also unto their 
fathers, that:  b Inasmuch as ye are 
not guilty of the c first offense, nei-
ther the second, ye shall not suffer 
yourselves to be slain by the hands 
of your enemies.

47 And  again,  the  Lord  has  said 
that: Ye shall a defend your families 
even  unto  b bloodshed.  Therefore 
for  this  cause  were  the  Nephites 
contending with the Lamanites, to 
defend themselves, and their fami-
lies, and their lands, their country, 
and their rights, and their religion.
48 And it came to pass that when 
the men of Moroni saw the fierce-
ness and the anger of the Lamanites, 
they were about to shrink and flee 
from them. And Moroni, perceiving 
their intent, sent forth and inspired 
their hearts with these thoughts—
yea,  the  thoughts  of  their  lands, 
their  liberty,  yea,  their  freedom 
from bondage.

49 And it came to pass that they 
turned  upon  the  Lamanites,  and 
they  a cried  with  one  voice  b unto 
the Lord their God, for their c liberty 
and their freedom from bondage.

50 And  they  a began  to  stand 
against the Lamanites with power; 
and in that selfsame hour that they 
cried unto the Lord for their free-
dom, the Lamanites began to flee 
before them; and they fled even to 
the waters of Sidon.
