and  as  these  things  are  c written 
for the intent of the benefit of our 
brethren the d Lamanites, wherefore, 
it must needs be that I write a little; 
but I shall not write the things of 
my prophesying, nor of my revela-
tions. For what could I write more 
than my fathers have written? For 
have not they revealed the plan of 
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and 
this sufficeth me.

because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts, and the deafness of their ears,  
and the blindness of their minds, 
and  the  a stiffness  of  their  necks; 
nevertheless,  God  is  exceedingly 
merciful unto them, and has not as 
yet b swept them off from the face 
of the land.

who  have  many  a revelations,  for 
they are not all b stiffnecked. And as  
many  as  are  not  stiffnecked  and 
have faith, have c communion with 
the Holy Spirit, which maketh mani-
fest unto the children of men, ac-
cording to their faith.

years  had  passed  away,  and  the 
people of Nephi had waxed strong 
in the land. They observed to a keep 
the law of Moses and the b sabbath 
day holy unto the Lord. And they 
c profaned  not;  neither  did  they 
d blaspheme.  And  the  e laws  of  the 
land were exceedingly strict.
