21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that 
there could be nothing so exquisite 
and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, 
and again I say unto you, my son, 
that on the other hand, there can 
be nothing so exquisite and sweet 
as was my joy.

22 Yea, methought I saw, even as 
our  father  a Lehi  saw,  God  sitting 
upon his throne, surrounded with 
numberless concourses of angels, in 
the attitude of singing and b prais-
ing their God; yea, and my soul did 
long to be there.

23 But behold, my limbs did receive 
their  a strength  again,  and  I  stood 
upon  my  feet,  and  did  manifest

unto  the  people  that  I  had  been 
b born of God.

24 Yea, and from that time even 
until now, I have labored without 
ceasing,  that  I  might  bring  souls 
unto a repentance; that I might bring 
them to b taste of the exceeding joy 
of which I did taste; that they might 
also be c born of God, and be d filled 
with the Holy Ghost.

25 Yea,  and  now  behold,  O  my 
son, the Lord doth a give me exceed-
ingly great joy in the fruit of my  
b labors;

26 For because of the a word which 
he has imparted unto me, behold, 
many have been born of God, and 
have b tasted as I have tasted, and have  
seen eye to eye as I have seen; there-
fore they do know of these things of 
which I have spoken, as I do know;  
and  the  knowledge  which  I  have 
is of God.

27 And I have been supported un-
der trials and troubles of every kind, 
yea, and in all manner of afflictions;  
yea,  God  has  a delivered  me  from 
prison, and from bonds, and from 
death; yea, and I do put my trust in 
him, and he will still b deliver me.
28 And I know that he will a raise 
me up at the last day, to dwell with 
him in b glory; yea, and I will c praise 
him  forever,  for  he  has  d brought 
our  fathers  out  of  Egypt,  and  he 
has swallowed up the e Egyptians in 
the Red Sea; and he led them by his 
power into the promised land; yea, 
and he has delivered them out of
