got  a  Bible,  and  there  cannot  be 
any more Bible.

4 But thus saith the Lord God: O  
fools, they shall have a a Bible; and  
it shall proceed forth from the b Jews, 
mine ancient covenant people. And 
what c thank they the d Jews for the 
Bible which they receive from them?  
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do  
they remember the travails, and the 
labors, and the pains of the Jews, and 
their diligence unto me, in bringing  
forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered 
the  Jews,  mine  ancient  covenant 
people?  Nay;  but  ye  have  a cursed  
them, and have  b hated them, and 
have not sought to recover them. But  
behold, I will return all these things 
upon your own heads; for I the Lord 
have not forgotten my people.

6 Thou fool, that shall say: A a Bible, 
we have got a Bible, and we need 
no  more  Bible.  Have  ye  obtained 
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

7 Know ye not that there are more 
a nations  than  one?  Know  ye  not 
that I, the Lord your God, have cre-
ated all men, and that I remember 
those who are upon the b isles of the 
sea; and that I rule in the heavens 
above  and  in  the  c earth  beneath; 
and I bring forth my d word unto the 
children of men, yea, even upon all 
the nations of the earth?

8 Wherefore murmur ye, because 
that  ye  shall  receive  more  of  my 
word? Know ye not that the a testi-

mony of b two nations is a c witness 
unto you that I am God, that I re-
member one d nation like unto an-
other? Wherefore, I speak the same 
words  unto  one  nation  like  unto 
another. And when the two e nations 
shall run together the testimony of 
the two nations shall run together  
also.
