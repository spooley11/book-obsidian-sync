17 Therefore,  a when  ye  shall  re-
ceive this record ye may know that 
the  work  of  the  Father  has  com-
menced upon all the face of the land.
18 Therefore, a repent all ye ends 
of  the  earth,  and  come  unto  me, 
and believe in my gospel, and be 
b baptized in my name; for he that 
believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved; but he that believeth not shall 
be damned; and c signs shall follow 
them that believe in my name.

19 And blessed is he that is found 
a faithful unto my name at the last 
day,  for  he  shall  be  b lifted  up  to 
dwell in the kingdom prepared for 
him  c from  the  foundation  of  the 
world. And behold it is I that hath 
spoken it. Amen.

CHAPTER 5

Three witnesses and the work itself will 
stand as a testimony of the truthfulness 
of the Book of Mormon.
And  now  I,  Moroni,  have  written 
the words which were commanded 
me, according to my memory; and 
I have told you the things which I  
have  a sealed  up;  therefore  touch 
them  not  in  order  that  ye  may 
translate; for that thing is forbidden

you,  except  by  and  by  it  shall  be 
wisdom in God.

2 And  behold,  ye  may  be  privi-
leged that ye may show the plates 
unto a those who shall assist to bring 
forth this work;

3 And  unto  a three  shall  they  be 
shown by the power of God; where-
fore  they  shall  b know  of  a  surety 
that these things are c true.

4 And in the mouth of three a wit-
nesses shall these things be estab-
lished; and the b testimony of three, 
and this work, in the which shall be 
shown forth the power of God and 
also his word, of which the Father, 
and  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Ghost 
bear record—and all this shall stand 
as a testimony against the world at  
the last day.

5 And if it so be that they repent  
and  a come unto the Father in the  
name of Jesus, they shall be received 
into the kingdom of God.

6 And now, if I have no authority  
for these things, judge ye; for ye shall 
know  that  I  have  authority  when  
ye shall see me, and we shall stand 
before God at the last day. Amen.
