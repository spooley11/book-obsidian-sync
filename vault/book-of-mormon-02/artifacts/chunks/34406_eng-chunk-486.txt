CHAPTER 19
Lamoni receives the light of everlasting 
life and sees the Redeemer—His house-

hold falls into a trance, and many see 
angels—Ammon  is  preserved  miracu-
lously—He baptizes many and establishes  
a church among them. About 90 b.c.

And it came to pass that after two 
days and two nights they were about 
to take his a body and lay it in a sep-
ulchre,  which  they  had  made  for 
the purpose of burying their dead.
2 Now the queen having heard of 
the fame of Ammon, therefore she 
sent  and  desired  that  he  should 
come in unto her.

3 And it came to pass that Ammon  
did  as  he  was  commanded,  and 
went in unto the queen, and desired  
to  know  what  she  would  that  he 
should do.

4 And she said unto him: The a ser-
vants of my husband have made it  
known  unto  me  that  thou  art  a 
b prophet  of  a  holy  God,  and  that 
thou hast c power to do many mighty 
works in his name;

5 Therefore,  if  this  is  the  case,  I 
would  that  ye  should  go  in  and  
see  my  husband,  for  he  has  been  
laid  upon  his  bed  for  the  space 
of  two  days  and  two  nights;  and 
some say that he is not dead, but 
others say that he is dead and that 
he a stinketh, and that he ought to 
be placed in the sepulchre; but as 
for myself, to me he doth not stink.
6 Now, this was what Ammon de-
sired, for he knew that king Lam-
oni was under the power of God; he 
knew that the dark a veil of b unbe-
lief was being cast away from his 
mind, and the c light which did light  
up his mind, which was the light of  
the glory of God, which was a mar-
velous light of his goodness—yea, 
this light had infused such joy into 
his soul, the cloud of darkness hav-
ing  been  dispelled,  and  that  the 
light of everlasting life was lit up in
