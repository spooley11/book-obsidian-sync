19 Now, whether the souls and the 
bodies of those of whom has been 
spoken shall all be reunited at once, 
the wicked as well as the righteous, 
I do not say; let it suffice, that I say 
that they all come forth; or in other 
words,  their  resurrection  cometh 
to pass a before the resurrection of 
those  who  die  after  the  resurrec-
tion of Christ.

20 Now, my son, I do not say that 
their resurrection cometh at the res-
urrection of Christ; but behold, I give 
it as my opinion, that the souls and  
the bodies are reunited, of the righ-
teous, at the resurrection of Christ, 
and his a ascension into heaven.

21 But whether it be at his resur-
rection or after, I do not say; but this 
much  I  say,  that  there  is  a  a space 
between death and the resurrection 
of the body, and a state of the soul 
in  b happiness  or  in  c misery  until 
the time which is appointed of God 
that the dead shall come forth, and 
be  reunited,  both  soul  and  body, 
and  be  d brought  to  stand  before 
God,  and  be  judged  according  to 
their works.

22 Yea,  this  bringeth  about  the 
restoration of those things of which 
has been spoken by the mouths of 
the prophets.

23 The a soul shall be b restored to 
the c body, and the body to the soul; 
yea, and every limb and joint shall 
be restored to its body; yea, even a 
d hair of the head shall not be lost; 
but all things shall be restored to 
their proper and e perfect frame.

24 And now, my son, this is the res-
toration of which has been a spoken 
by the mouths of the prophets—

25 And then shall the  a righteous 
shine forth in the kingdom of God.
26 But  behold,  an  awful  a death 
cometh upon the wicked; for they 
die as to things pertaining to things 
of  righteousness;  for  they  are  un-
clean,  and  b no  unclean  thing  can 
inherit  the  kingdom  of  God;  but 
they are cast out, and consigned to 
partake of the fruits of their labors 
or  their  works,  which  have  been 
evil; and they drink the dregs of a  
bitter c cup.
