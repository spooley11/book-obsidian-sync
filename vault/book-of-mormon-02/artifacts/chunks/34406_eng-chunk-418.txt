27 Have ye walked, keeping your-
selves a blameless before God? Could 
ye say, if ye were called to die at this 
time, within yourselves, that ye have 
been  sufficiently  b humble?  That 
your garments have been c cleansed 
and made white through the blood 
of Christ, who will come to d redeem 
his people from their sins?

28 Behold, are ye stripped of  a pride? 
I say unto you, if ye are not ye are 
not prepared to meet God. Behold ye 
must prepare quickly; for the king-
dom of heaven is soon at hand, and 
such an one hath not eternal life.

29 Behold, I say, is there one among  
you who is not stripped of a envy ? I 
say unto you that such an one is not 
prepared; and I would that he should 
prepare  b quickly,  for  the  hour  is 
close at hand, and he knoweth not 
when the time shall come; for such 
an one is not found guiltless.

30 And  again  I  say  unto  you,  is 
there  one  among  you  that  doth 
make a a mock of his brother, or that 
heapeth upon him persecutions?

31 Wo  unto  such  an  one,  for  he 
is  not  prepared,  and  the  a time  is 
at hand that he must repent or he 
cannot be saved!

32 Yea, even wo unto all ye a work-
ers of iniquity; repent, repent, for 
the Lord God hath spoken it!

33 Behold, he sendeth an invita-
tion unto a all men, for the b arms of 
mercy are extended towards them, 
and  he  saith:  Repent,  and  I  will  
receive you.

34 Yea, he saith:  a Come unto me 
and  ye  shall  partake  of  the  b fruit 
of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat 
and  drink  of  the  c bread  and  the 
waters of life d freely;

35 Yea, come unto me and bring 
forth works of righteousness, and 
ye shall not be hewn down and cast 
into the fire—

36 For behold, the time is at hand 
that  whosoever  a bringeth  forth 
not  good  fruit,  or  whosoever  do-
eth not the works of righteousness, 
the  same  have  cause  to  wail  and  
mourn.
