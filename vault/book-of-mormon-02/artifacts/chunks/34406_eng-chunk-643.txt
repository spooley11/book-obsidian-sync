40 And now the number of prison-
ers who were taken exceeded more 
than the number of those who had 
been  slain,  yea,  more  than  those 
who had been slain on both sides.

CHAPTER 53

The Lamanite prisoners are used to 
fortify  the  city  Bountiful—Dissen-
sions among the Nephites give rise to 
Lamanite victories—Helaman takes 
command of the two thousand strip-
ling  sons  of  the  people  of  Ammon.  
About 64–63 b.c.
And it came to pass that they did 
set guards over the prisoners of the 
Lamanites, and did compel them to 
go forth and bury their dead, yea, 
and also the dead of the Nephites 
who were slain; and Moroni placed 
men  over  them  to  guard  them 
while  they  should  perform  their  
labors.

2 And Moroni went to the city of 
Mulek  with  Lehi,  and  took  com-
mand of the city and gave it unto 
Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a 
man who had been with Moroni in 
the more part of all his battles; and 
he  was  a  man  a like  unto  Moroni, 
and  they  rejoiced  in  each  other’s

safety;  yea,  they  were  beloved  by 
each other, and also beloved by all 
the people of Nephi.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
the Lamanites had finished burying  
their dead and also the dead of the 
Nephites, they were marched back 
into the land Bountiful; and Tean-
cum, by the orders of Moroni, caused 
that they should commence laboring 
in a digging a ditch round about the 
land, or the city, b Bountiful.

4 And he caused that they should 
build a a breastwork of timbers upon 
the inner bank of the ditch; and they 
cast up dirt out of the ditch against 
the breastwork of timbers; and thus 
they  did  cause  the  Lamanites  to 
labor until they had encircled the 
city of Bountiful round about with 
a strong wall of timbers and earth, 
to an exceeding height.

5 And this city became an exceed-
ing stronghold ever after; and in this 
city they did guard the prisoners of 
the Lamanites; yea, even within a 
wall which they had caused them to 
a build with their own hands. Now 
Moroni was compelled to cause the 
Lamanites to labor, because it was 
easy to guard them while at their 
labor; and he desired all his forces 
when  he  should  make  an  attack 
upon the Lamanites.
