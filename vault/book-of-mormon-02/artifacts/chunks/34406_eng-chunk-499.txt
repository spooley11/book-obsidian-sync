Aaron teaches Lamoni’s father about 
the Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the 
plan  of  redemption  through  Christ—
The  king  and  all  his  household  are 
converted—The division of the land be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites 
is explained. About 90–77 b.c.
Now, as Ammon was thus teaching 
the people of Lamoni continually, 
we  will  return  to  the  account  of 
Aaron and his brethren; for after he 
departed from the land of Middoni 
he was a led by the Spirit to the land 
of Nephi, even to the house of the 
king which was b over all the land 
c save it were the land of Ishmael; 
and he was the father of Lamoni.

2 And it came to pass that he went 
in unto him into the king’s palace, 
with his brethren, and bowed him-
self before the king, and said unto 
him:  Behold,  O  king,  we  are  the 
brethren  of  Ammon,  whom  thou 
hast a delivered out of b prison.

3 And  now,  O  king,  if  thou  wilt 
spare  our  lives,  we  will  be  thy 
servants.  And  the  king  said  unto 
them:  Arise,  for  I  will  grant  unto 
you your lives, and I will not suffer 
that ye shall be my servants; but I 
will insist that ye shall administer 
unto me; for I have been somewhat 
a troubled  in  mind  because  of  the 
b generosity  and  the  greatness  of 
the words of thy brother Ammon; 
and I desire to know the cause why 
he has not come up out of Middoni  
with thee.

4 And Aaron said unto the king: 
Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has 
called him another way; he has gone 
a to the land of Ishmael, to teach the 
people of Lamoni.

5 Now  the  king  said  unto  them: 
What  is  this  that  ye  have  said  
concerning the Spirit of the Lord?
