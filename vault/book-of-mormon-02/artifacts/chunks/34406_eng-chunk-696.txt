Many  Nephites  migrate  to  the  land 
northward—They  build  houses  of  ce-
ment  and  keep  many  records—Tens 
of  thousands  are  converted  and  bap-
tized—The word of God leads men to 
salvation—Nephi the son of Helaman 
fills the judgment seat. About 49–39 b.c.

And now it came to pass in the forty 
and third year of the reign of the 
judges,  there  was  no  contention 
among  the  people  of  Nephi  save 
it were a little pride which was in 
the church, which did cause some 
little dissensions among the people, 
which  affairs  were  settled  in  the 
ending of the forty and third year.
2 And  there  was  no  contention 
among  the  people  in  the  forty 
and fourth year; neither was there 
much contention in the forty and  
fifth year.

3 And it came to pass in the forty 
and sixth, yea, there was much con-
tention and many dissensions; in the 
which  there  were  an  exceedingly 
great  many  who  departed  out  of 
the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and  went

forth unto the land a northward to 
inherit the land.

4 And  they  did  travel  to  an  ex-
ceedingly great distance, insomuch 
that they came to a large bodies of 
water and many rivers.

5 Yea,  and  even  they  did  spread 
forth  into  all  parts  of  the  land,  
into whatever parts it had not been 
rendered desolate and without tim-
ber,  because  of  the  many  inhabi-
tants who had before inherited the  
land.

6 And now no part of the land was 
desolate,  save  it  were  for  timber; 
but because of the greatness of the 
a destruction of the people who had 
before  inhabited  the  land  it  was 
called b desolate.

7 And there being but little timber 
upon  the  face  of  the  land,  never-
theless the people who went forth 
became exceedingly a expert in the 
working of cement; therefore they 
did build houses of cement, in the 
which they did dwell.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
did multiply and spread, and did 
go forth from the land southward  
to  the  land  northward,  and  did 
spread insomuch that they began 
to cover the face of the whole earth, 
from the sea south to the sea north, 
from the a sea west to the sea east.
