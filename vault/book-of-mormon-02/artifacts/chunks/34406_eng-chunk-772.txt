3 And the robbers could not exist 
save it were in the wilderness, for 
the want of food; for the Nephites 
had  left  their  lands  desolate,  and 
had gathered their flocks and their 
herds and all their substance, and 
they were in one body.

4 Therefore, there was no chance 
for the robbers to plunder and to 
obtain food, save it were to come 
up in open battle against the Neph-
ites; and the Nephites being in one 
body, and having so great a num-
ber, and having reserved for them-
selves provisions, and a horses and 
cattle, and flocks of every kind, that 
they  might  subsist  for  the  space 
of b seven years, in the which time 
they did hope to destroy the rob-
bers from off the face of the land; 
and  thus  the  eighteenth  year  did  
pass away.

5 And it came to pass that in the 
nineteenth  year  Giddianhi  found 
that it was expedient that he should 
go up to battle against the Neph-
ites, for there was a no way that they 
could subsist save it were to plun-
der and rob and murder.

6 And they durst not spread them-
selves upon the face of the land in-
somuch that they could raise grain, 
lest the Nephites should come upon
