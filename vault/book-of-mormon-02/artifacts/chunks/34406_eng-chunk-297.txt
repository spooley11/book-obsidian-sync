MOSIAH 3  : 14–22

14 Yet the Lord God saw that his 
people were a a stiffnecked people, 
and he appointed unto them a b law, 
even the c law of Moses.

15 And many signs, and wonders, 
and a types, and shadows showed he 
unto them, concerning his coming; 
and also holy prophets spake unto 
them concerning his coming; and 
yet  they  b hardened  their  hearts, 
and  understood  not  that  the  c law 
of Moses availeth nothing  d except 
it were through the e atonement of 
his blood.

16 And  even  if  it  were  possible 
that little a children could sin they 
could not be saved; but I say unto 
you they are  b blessed; for behold, 
as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, 
even so the blood of Christ c atoneth 
for their sins.

17 And moreover, I say unto you, 
that there shall be a no other name 
given nor any other way nor means 
whereby b salvation can come unto 
the  children  of  men,  only  in  and 
through  the  name  of  Christ,  the 
c Lord Omnipotent.

18 For  behold  he  judgeth,  and  
his  judgment  is  just;  and  the  in-
fant  perisheth  not  that  dieth  in 
his infancy; but men drink  a dam-
nation  to  their  own  souls  except 
they  humble  themselves  and  b be-

come  as  little  children,  and  be-
lieve  that  c salvation  was,  and  is, 
and is to come, in and through the 
d atoning blood of Christ, the Lord  
Omnipotent.

19 For  the  a natural  b man  is  an 
c enemy to God, and has been from 
the d fall of Adam, and will be, for-
ever and ever, unless he e yields to 
the  enticings  of  the  f  Holy  Spirit, 
and g putteth off the h natural man 
and becometh a i saint through the 
atonement of Christ the Lord, and 
becometh as a j child, k submissive, 
meek, humble, patient, full of love, 
willing to submit to all things which 
the  Lord  seeth  fit  to  inflict  upon 
him,  even  as  a  child  doth  submit 
to his father.
