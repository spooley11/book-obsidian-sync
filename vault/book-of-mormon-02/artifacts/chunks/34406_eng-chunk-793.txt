11 And  because  they  did  cast 
them all out, that there were none 
righteous among them, I did send 
down a fire and destroy them, that 
their wickedness and abominations 
might be hid from before my b face, 
that the blood of the prophets and 
the saints whom I sent among them 
might  not  cry  unto  me  c from  the 
ground against them.

12 And a many great destructions 
have I caused to come upon this land,  
and  upon  this  people,  because  of 
their wickedness and their abomi-
nations.

13 O all ye that are a spared because 
ye were more b righteous than they, 
will ye not now return unto me, and  
repent  of  your  sins,  and  be  con-
verted, that I may c heal you?

14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye 
will  a come unto me ye shall have 
b eternal life. Behold, mine c arm of 
mercy is extended towards you, and 
whosoever  will  come,  him  will  I 
receive; and blessed are those who 
come unto me.

15 Behold,  I  am  Jesus  Christ  the 
Son of God. I a created the heavens

and the earth, and all things that in 
them are. I was with the Father from 
the beginning. b I am in the Father,  
and  the  Father  in  me;  and  in  me 
hath the Father glorified his name.
16 I came unto my own, and my 
own  a received  me  not.  And  the 
scriptures b concerning my coming 
are fulfilled.

17 And as many as have received 
me, to them have I a given to become 
the sons of God; and even so will I 
to as many as shall believe on my 
name, for behold, by me b redemp-
tion cometh, and c in me is the d law 
of Moses fulfilled.

18 I am the a light and the life of 
the world. I am b Alpha and Omega, 
the beginning and the end.

19 And ye shall offer up unto me 
a no  more  the  shedding  of  blood; 
yea, your sacrifices and your burnt 
offerings shall be done away, for I 
will accept none of your sacrifices 
and your burnt offerings.
