to  pass  the  d resurrection,  that  all 
men shall stand before him, to be 
e judged  at  the  last  and  judgment 
day, according to their f works.

hearts, and as it beginneth to swell 
even so nourish it by your faith. And 
behold, it will become a tree, b spring-
ing  up  in  you  unto  c everlasting
