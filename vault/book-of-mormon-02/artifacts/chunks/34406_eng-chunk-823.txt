17 And no a tongue can speak, nei-
ther  can  there  be  written  by  any 
man, neither can the hearts of men 
conceive  so  great  and  marvelous 
things  as  we  both  saw  and  heard

Jesus speak; and no one can conceive 
of the joy which filled our souls at 
the time we heard him pray for us 
unto the Father.

18 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had made an end of praying 
unto  the  Father,  he  arose;  but  so 
great was the a joy of the multitude 
that they were overcome.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus 
spake  unto  them,  and  bade  them 
arise.

20 And they arose from the earth, 
and he said unto them: Blessed are 
ye because of your faith. And a now 
behold, my joy is full.

21 And  when  he  had  said  these 
words, he a wept, and the multitude 
bare record of it, and he took their 
little  children,  one  by  one,  and 
b blessed them, and prayed unto the 
Father for them.

22 And when he had done this he

wept again;

23 And he spake unto the multi-
tude, and said unto them: Behold 
your little ones.

24 And  as  they  looked  to  behold 
they cast their eyes towards heaven, 
and they saw the heavens open, and 
they saw angels descending out of 
heaven as it were in the midst of fire; 
and they came down and a encircled 
those  little  ones  about,  and  they 
were encircled about with fire; and 
the angels did minister unto them.
25 And the multitude did see and 
a hear  and  bear  record;  and  they 
know that their record is true for 
they all of them did see and hear, 
every  man  for  himself;  and  they 
were  in  number  about  two  thou-
sand and five hundred souls; and 
they  did  consist  of  men,  women, 
and children.
