gone hence, who were the holy ones,  
should be fulfilled according to their  
faith, should make a a record of these 
things which have been done—

15 Yea, a a small record of that which  
hath taken place from the time that 
Lehi left Jerusalem, even down un-
til the present time.

16 Therefore I do make my record 
from the accounts which have been 
given by those who were before me, 
until the commencement of my day;
17 And then I do make a a record of 
the things which I have seen with 
mine own eyes.

18 And I know the record which I 
make to be a just and a true record; 
nevertheless there are many things 
which, according to our a language, 
we are not able to b write.

19 And now I make an end of my 
saying,  which  is  of  myself,  and 
proceed to give my account of the 
things which have been before me.
20 I am Mormon, and a pure a de-
scendant of Lehi. I have reason to 
bless my God and my Savior Jesus 
Christ, that he brought our fathers 
out of the land of Jerusalem, (and 
b no one knew it save it were him-
self  and  those  whom  he  brought 
out of that land) and that he hath 
given me and my people so much 
knowledge  unto  the  salvation  of  
our souls.
