40 And the angel spake unto me, 
saying: These  a last records, which 
thou hast seen among the Gentiles, 
shall b establish the truth of the c first, 
which are of the d twelve apostles of 
the Lamb, and shall make known 
the plain and precious things which 
have been taken away from them; 
and shall make known to all kin-
dreds,  tongues,  and  people,  that 
the Lamb of God is the Son of the 
Eternal Father, and the  e Savior of 
the world; and that all men must 
come unto him, or they cannot be  
saved.

41 And they must come according 
to the words which shall be estab-
lished by the mouth of the Lamb; 
and the words of the Lamb shall be 
made known in the records of thy 
seed, as well as in the a records of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb; where-
fore they both shall be established 
in  b one; for there is  c one God and 
one d Shepherd over all the earth.

42 And the time cometh that he 
shall manifest himself unto all na-
tions, both unto the a Jews and also 
unto the Gentiles; and after he has 
manifested himself unto the Jews 
and  also  unto  the  Gentiles,  then 
he shall manifest himself unto the 
Gentiles  and  also  unto  the  Jews, 
and the b last shall be first, and the 
c first shall be last.

CHAPTER 14

An angel tells Nephi of the blessings and 
cursings to fall upon the Gentiles—There 
are only two churches: the Church of 
the Lamb of God and the church of the 
devil—The Saints of God in all nations 
are persecuted by the great and abomi-
nable church—The Apostle John will 
write concerning the end of the world. 
About 600–592 b.c.
And  it  shall  come  to  pass,  that  if 
the  a Gentiles  shall  hearken  unto 
the Lamb of God in that day that 
he shall manifest himself unto them 
in word, and also in b power, in very 
deed, unto the c taking away of their 
d stumbling blocks—
