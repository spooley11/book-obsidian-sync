8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do 
not desire to harrow up the souls of 
men in casting before them such an 
awful scene of blood and carnage 
as was laid before mine eyes; but 
I, knowing that these things must 
surely  be  made  known,  and  that 
all  things  which  are  hid  must  be 
a revealed upon the house-tops—

9 And  also  that  a  knowledge  of 
these things must  a come unto the 
remnant of these people, and also 
unto  the  Gentiles,  who  the  Lord

MORMON 5  : 10–19

hath said should b scatter this people, 
and this people should be counted 
as naught among them—therefore 
c I write a  d small abridgment, dar-
ing not to give a full account of the 
things which I have seen, because 
of the commandment which I have 
received,  and  also  that  ye  might 
not have too great sorrow because 
of the wickedness of this people.

10 And now behold, this I speak 
unto their seed, and also to the Gen-
tiles who have care for the house of 
Israel, that realize and know from 
whence their blessings come.

11 For I know that such will sor-
row for the calamity of the house 
of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for 
the destruction of this people; they 
will  sorrow  that  this  people  had 
not repented that they might have 
been clasped in the arms of Jesus.
12 Now a these things are b written 
unto the c remnant of the house of 
Jacob; and they are written after this 
manner, because it is known of God  
that wickedness will not bring them 
forth unto them; and they are to be 
d hid up unto the Lord that they may 
come forth in his own due time.

13 And this is the commandment 
which I have received; and behold, 
they  a shall  come  forth  accord-
ing  to  the  commandment  of  the 
Lord, when he shall see fit, in his  
wisdom.
