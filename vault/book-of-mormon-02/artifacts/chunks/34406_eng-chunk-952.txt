35 Wherefore, I know by this thing 
which  thou  hast  said,  that  if  the 
Gentiles have not a charity, because 
of  our  weakness,  that  thou  wilt 
prove them, and  b take away their 
c talent, yea, even that which they 
have received, and give unto them 
who shall have more abundantly.

36 And it came to pass that I prayed 
unto the Lord that he would give unto  
the Gentiles a grace, that they might 
have charity.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord said unto me: If they have not 
charity it mattereth not unto thee, 
thou hast been faithful; wherefore,  
thy garments shall be made a clean. 
And  because  thou  hast  seen  thy 
b weakness thou shalt be made strong,  
even unto the sitting down in the 
place  which  I  have  prepared  in  
the mansions of my Father.

38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell 
unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto 
my brethren whom I love, until we 
shall  meet  before  the  a judgment-
seat of Christ, where all men shall 
know  that  my  b garments  are  not 
spotted with your blood.

39 And then shall ye know that I 
have a seen Jesus, and that he hath 
talked with me  b face to face, and 
that he told me in c plain humility, 
even  as  a  man  telleth  another  in 
mine  own  language,  concerning 
these things;

40 And only a few have I written, 
because of my weakness in writing.
41 And  now,  I  would  commend 
you to a seek this Jesus of whom the
