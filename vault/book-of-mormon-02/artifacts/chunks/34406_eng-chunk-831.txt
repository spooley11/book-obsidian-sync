20 Father, I thank thee that thou 
hast given the Holy Ghost unto these 
whom I have a chosen; and it is be-
cause  of  their  belief  in  me  that  I 
have chosen them out of the world.
21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt 
give the Holy Ghost unto all them 
that shall believe in their words.

22 Father,  thou  hast  given  them 
the  Holy  Ghost  because  they  be-
lieve  in  a me;  and  thou  seest  that 
they  believe  in  me  because  thou 
hearest them, and they pray unto 
me; and they pray unto me because 
I am with them.

23 And now Father, I  a pray unto 
thee for them, and also for all those 
who shall believe on their words, 
that they may believe in me, that 
I may be in them b as thou, Father, 
art in me, that we may be c one.

24 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus  had  thus  prayed  unto  the 
Father, he came unto his disciples, 
and behold, they did still continue, 
without ceasing, to pray unto him; 
and they did not  a multiply many 
words, for it was given unto them 
what they should  b pray, and they 
were filled with desire.

25 And it came to pass that Jesus 
blessed them as they did pray unto 
him; and his a countenance did smile 
upon  them,  and  the  light  of  his  
b countenance did c shine upon them, 
and behold they were as d white as  
the countenance and also the gar-
ments  of  Jesus;  and  behold  the  
whiteness  thereof  did  exceed  all  
the whiteness, yea, even there could 
be nothing upon earth so white as 
the whiteness thereof.

26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray 
on; nevertheless they did not cease 
to pray.
