6 And it came to pass that as we 
journeyed  in  the  wilderness,  be-
hold Laman and Lemuel, and two 
of the  a daughters of Ishmael, and 
the two b sons of Ishmael and their 
families, did c rebel against us; yea, 
against  me,  Nephi,  and  Sam,  and 
their father, Ishmael, and his wife, 
and his three other daughters.

7 And it came to pass in the which 
rebellion, they were desirous to re-
turn unto the land of Jerusalem.

8 And now I, Nephi, being a grieved 
for  the  hardness  of  their  hearts, 
therefore  I  spake  unto  them,  say-
ing, yea, even unto Laman and unto 
Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder 
brethren,  and  how  is  it  that  ye 
are so hard in your hearts, and so 
blind in your minds, that ye have 
need that I, your b younger brother, 
should speak unto you, yea, and set 
an c example for you?

9 How is it that ye have not heark-

ened unto the word of the Lord?

10 How is it that ye have a forgot-
ten that ye have seen an angel of 
the Lord?

11 Yea, and how is it that ye have 
forgotten  what  great  things  the 
Lord hath done for us, in a delivering  
us out of the hands of Laban, and 
also  that  we  should  obtain  the  
record?
