48 I say unto you, that I know of 
myself that whatsoever I shall say 
unto  you,  concerning  that  which 
is to come, is true; and I say unto 
you, that I know that Jesus Christ 
shall come, yea, the Son, the Only 
Begotten of the Father, full of grace, 
and mercy, and truth. And behold, 
it is he that cometh to take away 
the sins of the world, yea, the sins 
of every man who steadfastly be-
lieveth on his name.

49 And  now  I  say  unto  you  that 
this is the a order after which I am 
called, yea, to preach unto my be-
loved brethren, yea, and every one 
that  dwelleth  in  the  land;  yea,  to 
preach unto all, both old and young, 
both bond and free; yea, I say unto 
you the aged, and also the middle 
aged, and the rising generation; yea, 
to  cry  unto  them  that  they  must 
repent and be b born again.

50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent,  
all  ye  ends  of  the  earth,  for  the 
kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; 
yea, the Son of God cometh in his 
a glory, in his might, majesty, power,

brethren, I say unto you, that the 
Spirit  saith:  Behold  the  glory  of  
the  b King  of  all  the  earth;  and  
also the King of heaven shall very 
soon shine forth among all the chil-

me,  yea,  crieth  unto  me  with  a 
mighty voice, saying: Go forth and 
say unto this people—Repent, for 
except ye repent ye can in nowise 
inherit the a kingdom of b heaven.
