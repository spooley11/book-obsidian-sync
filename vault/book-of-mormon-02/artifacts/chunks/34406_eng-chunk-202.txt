15 After my seed and the seed of 
my brethren shall have a dwindled 
in  unbelief,  and  shall  have  been 
smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after 
the Lord God shall have  b camped 
against them round about, and shall 
have laid siege against them with 
a  mount,  and  raised  forts  against 
them; and after they shall have been 
brought down low in the dust, even 
that they are not, yet the words of 
the righteous shall be written, and 
the  c prayers  of  the  faithful  shall 
be heard, and all those who have 
d dwindled in unbelief shall not be 
forgotten.

16 For those who shall be destroyed  
shall  a speak unto them out of the 
ground, and their speech shall be 
low out of the dust, and their voice 
shall be as one that hath a famil-
iar  spirit;  for  the  Lord  God  will 
give unto him power, that he may 
whisper concerning them, even as 
it were out of the ground; and their 
speech shall whisper out of the dust.

17 For  thus  saith  the  Lord  God: 
They shall a write the things which 
shall  be  done  among  them,  and  
they  shall  be  written  and  b sealed 
up in a book, and those who have  
dwindled  in  c unbelief  shall  not  
have them, for they d seek to destroy 
the things of God.

18 Wherefore, as those who have 
been destroyed have been destroyed 
speedily; and the multitude of their 
a terrible ones shall be as b chaff that 
passeth away—yea, thus saith the 
Lord God: It shall be at an instant, 
suddenly—

19 And it shall come to pass, that 
those who have dwindled in unbe-
lief shall be a smitten by the hand 
of the Gentiles.

20 And the Gentiles are lifted up 
in the a pride of their eyes, and have 
b stumbled, because of the greatness 
of their c stumbling block, that they 
have built up many d churches; nev-
ertheless, they e put down the power 
and miracles of God, and preach up 
unto themselves their own wisdom 
and their own f  learning, that they 
may get gain and g grind upon the 
face of the poor.

21 And there are many churches 
built  up  which  cause  a envyings, 
and b strifes, and c malice.
