11 And it came to pass that they 
were  not  so  strong  in  number  as 
the tribes of the people, who were 
united together save it were their 
leaders  did  establish  their  laws, 
every  one  according  to  his  tribe; 
nevertheless they were enemies; not-
withstanding they were not a righ-
teous people, yet they were united 
in the hatred of those who had en-
tered into a covenant to a destroy the  
government.

12 Therefore,  Jacob  seeing  that 
their enemies were more numerous 
than they, he being the king of the 
band, therefore he commanded his

people that they should take their 
flight into the northernmost part of 
the land, and there build up unto 
themselves a a kingdom, until they 
were joined by dissenters, (for he 
flattered them that there would be 
many dissenters) and they become 
sufficiently strong to contend with 
the tribes of the people; and they 
did so.

13 And so speedy was their march 
that it could not be impeded until 
they had gone forth out of the reach 
of the people. And thus ended the 
thirtieth  year;  and  thus  were  the 
affairs of the people of Nephi.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
thirty and first year that they were 
divided  into  tribes,  every  man 
according  to  his  family,  kindred 
and friends; nevertheless they had 
come  to  an  agreement  that  they 
would not go to war one with an-
other; but they were not united as 
to their laws, and their manner of 
government, for they were estab-
lished  according  to  the  minds  of 
those  who  were  their  chiefs  and 
their leaders. But they did estab-
lish very strict laws that one tribe 
should not trespass against another, 
insomuch that in some degree they 
had peace in the land; nevertheless, 
their hearts were turned from the 
Lord their God, and they did stone 
the  a prophets  and  did  cast  them 
out from among them.
