ye not the  b reproach of men, nei-
ther be ye afraid of their c revilings.
8 For  the  a moth  shall  eat  them 
up like a garment, and the worm 
shall  eat  them  like  wool.  But  my 
righteousness shall be forever, and 
my  salvation  from  generation  to 
generation.

9 a Awake, awake! Put on b strength, 
O arm of the Lord; awake as in the 
ancient days. Art thou not he that 
hath cut c Rahab, and wounded the 
d dragon?

10 Art thou not he who hath dried 
the sea, the waters of the great deep; 
that hath made the depths of the 
sea a a way for the ransomed to pass  
over?

11 Therefore, the a redeemed of the 
Lord shall b return, and come with 
c singing unto Zion; and everlasting 
joy and holiness shall be upon their 
heads; and they shall obtain glad-
ness and joy; sorrow and d mourning 
shall flee away.

12 a I am he; yea, I am he that com-
forteth you. Behold, who art thou, 
that  thou  shouldst  be  b afraid  of 
man, who shall die, and of the son 
of man, who shall be made like unto  
c grass?

13 And  a forgettest  the  Lord  thy 
maker,  that  hath  b stretched  forth 
the heavens, and laid the founda-
tions of the earth, and hast feared 
continually every day, because of 
the fury of the c oppressor, as if he 
were ready to destroy ? And where 
is the fury of the oppressor?

14 The  a captive  exile  hasteneth, 
that he may be loosed, and that he

should not die in the pit, nor that 
his bread should fail.

15 But  I  am  the  Lord  thy  God, 
whose  a waves  roared;  the  Lord  of 
Hosts is my name.

16 And I have  a put my words in 
thy mouth, and have covered thee 
in the shadow of mine hand, that 
I  may  plant  the  heavens  and  lay 
the foundations of the earth, and 
say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my 
b people.
