according to his desires, and marched  
forth  into  the  wilderness,  and 
headed the armies of Amalickiah.
33 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah a fled with a small number of 
his men, and the remainder were 
delivered up into the hands of Mo-
roni and were taken back into the 
land of Zarahemla.

34 Now, Moroni being a man who 
was a appointed by the chief judges 
and the voice of the people, there-
fore he had power according to his 
will with the armies of the Neph-
ites,  to  establish  and  to  exercise 
authority over them.

35 And it came to pass that whom-
soever  of  the  Amalickiahites  that 
would not enter into a covenant to 
support the a cause of freedom, that 
they might maintain a free b govern-
ment, he caused to be put to death; 
and there were but few who denied 
the covenant of freedom.

36 And it came to pass also, that 
he caused the a title of liberty to be 
hoisted upon every tower which was 
in all the land, which was possessed 
by the Nephites; and thus Moroni 
planted  the  standard  of  liberty 
among the Nephites.

37 And they began to have peace 
again in the land; and thus they did 
maintain  peace  in  the  land  until 
nearly  the  end  of  the  nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges.

38 And  Helaman  and  the  a high 
priests did also maintain order in 
the church; yea, even for the space 
of four years did they have much 
peace and rejoicing in the church.
39 And it came to pass that there 
were many who died, firmly a believ-
ing that their souls were redeemed 
by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they 
went out of the world rejoicing.

40 And there were some who died

with fevers, which at some seasons 
of the year were very frequent in 
the land—but not so much so with 
fevers,  because  of  the  excellent 
quali ties of the many  a plants and 
roots which God had prepared to re-
move the cause of  b diseases, to which 
men were subject by the nature of  
the climate—

41 But there were many who died 
with a old age; and those who died 
in the faith of Christ are b happy in  
him, as we must needs suppose.
