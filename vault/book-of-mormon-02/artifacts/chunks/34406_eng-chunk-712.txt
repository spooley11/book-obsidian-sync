The righteous Lamanites preach to the 
wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper 
during  an  era  of  peace  and  plenty—
Lucifer, the author of sin, stirs up the 
hearts of the wicked and the Gadianton 
robbers in murder and wickedness—The 
robbers take over the Nephite govern-
ment. About 29–23 b.c.
And it came to pass that when the 
sixty and second year of the reign 
of the judges had ended, all these 
things had happened and the La-
manites had become, the more part 
of them, a righteous people, inso-
much that their a righteousness did 
exceed that of the Nephites, because 
of their firmness and their steadi-
ness in the faith.

2 For behold, there were many of 
the Nephites who had become a hard-
ened  and  impenitent  and  grossly 
wicked,  insomuch  that  they  did 
reject the word of God and all the 
preaching and prophesying which 
did come among them.

3 Nevertheless, the people of the 
church did have great joy because 
of  the  conversion  of  the  Laman-
ites, yea, because of the church of  
God,  which  had  been  established 
among them. And they did a fellow-
ship one with another, and did re-
joice one with another, and did have  
great joy.

4 And it came to pass that many 
of  the  Lamanites  did  come  down 
into  the  land  of  Zarahemla,  and 
did declare unto the people of the 
Nephites the manner of their a con-
version,  and  did  exhort  them  to 
faith and repentance.

5 Yea, and many did a preach with 
exceedingly great power and author-
ity, unto the bringing down many

of them into the depths of humil-
ity, to be the humble followers of 
God and the Lamb.

6 And it came to pass that many of 
the Lamanites did go into the land 
northward;  and  also  a Nephi  and 
b Lehi went into the c land northward, 
to preach unto the people. And thus 
ended the sixty and third year.

7 And behold, there was peace in 
all the land, insomuch that the Neph-
ites did go into whatsoever part of 
the land they would, whether among  
the Nephites or the Lamanites.
