21 And  ye  all  are  witnesses  this 
day, that Zeniff, who was made king 
over  this  people,  he  being  a over-
zealous  to  inherit  the  land  of  his 
fathers, therefore being deceived by 
the cunning and craftiness of king  
Laman, who having entered into a 
treaty with king Zeniff, and having  
yielded up into his hands the posses-
sions of a part of the land, or even 
the  city  of  Lehi-Nephi,  and  the  
city of Shilom; and the land round 
about—

22 And all this he did, for the sole 
purpose of a bringing this people into 
subjection or into bondage. And be-
hold, we at this time do pay b tribute  
to the king of the Lamanites, to the 
amount of one half of our corn, and 
our barley, and even all our grain 
of every kind, and one half of the 
increase of our flocks and our herds; 
and even one half of all we have or 
possess the king of the Lamanites 
doth exact of us, or our lives.

23 And now, is not this grievous 
to  be  borne?  And  is  not  this,  our 
affliction, great? Now behold, how 
great reason we have to a mourn.

24 Yea, I say unto you, great are the 
reasons which we have to a mourn; 
for behold how many of our breth-
ren have been slain, and their blood 
has been spilt in vain, and all be-
cause of iniquity.

25 For if this people had not fallen 
into transgression the Lord would 
not have suffered that this great evil 
should come upon them. But behold,
