11 But if it be not built upon my 
gospel, and is built upon the works 
of men, or upon the works of the 
devil, verily I say unto you they have  
joy  in  their  works  for  a  season,  
and by and by the end cometh, and 
they are a hewn down and cast into 
the b fire, from whence there is no  
return.

12 For their works do a follow them, 
for it is because of their works that 
they are hewn down; therefore re-
member the things that I have told  
you.

13 Behold I have given unto you 
my  a gospel, and this is the gospel 
which I have given unto you—that I 
came into the world to do the b will 
of  my  Father,  because  my  Father  
sent me.

14 And my Father sent me that I 
might be a lifted up upon the b cross; 
and after that I had been lifted up 
upon the c cross, that I might d draw 
all men unto me, that as I have been 
lifted  up  by  men  even  so  should 
men be lifted up by the Father, to 
stand before me, to be  e judged of 
their works, whether they be good 
or whether they be evil—

15 And for this cause have I been 
a lifted up; therefore, according to 
the power of the Father I will draw 
all men unto me, that they may be 
judged according to their b works.

16 And it shall come to pass, that

whoso  a repenteth and is baptized 
in my b name shall be filled; and if 
he  c endureth  to  the  end,  behold, 
him  will  I  hold  guiltless  before 
my Father at that day when I shall 
stand to judge the world.

17 And he that endureth not unto 
the end, the same is he that is also 
hewn down and cast into the fire, 
from  whence  they  can  no  more 
return,  because  of  the  a justice  of 
the Father.
