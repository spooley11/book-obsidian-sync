13 And  when  that  great  day 
cometh, behold, the time very soon 
cometh that those who are now, or 
the seed of those who are now num-
bered among the people of Nephi, 
shall a no more be numbered among 
the people of Nephi.

14 But whosoever remaineth, and 
is not destroyed in that great and 
dreadful day, shall be  a numbered 
among  the  b Lamanites,  and  shall 
become  like  unto  them,  all,  save 
it be a few who shall be called the 
disciples  of  the  Lord;  and  them 
shall  the  Lamanites  pursue  even 
c until  they  shall  become  extinct. 
And now, because of iniquity, this 
prophecy shall be fulfilled.

15 And now it came to pass that 
after Alma had said these things to 
Helaman, he a blessed him, and also 
his other sons; and he also blessed 
the earth for the b righteous’ sake.

16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord 
God—a Cursed  shall  be  the  land, 
yea,  this  land,  unto  every  nation, 
kindred, tongue, and people, unto 
destruction,  which  do  b wickedly, 
when they are fully ripe; and as I 
have said so shall it be; for this is 
the cursing and the c blessing of God 
upon the land, for the Lord cannot

look upon sin with the d least degree 
of allowance.

17 And now, when Alma had said 
these words he blessed the a church, 
yea, all those who should stand fast 
in the faith from that time hence-
forth.

18 And when Alma had done this 
he a departed out of the land of  Zara-
hemla, as if to go into the land of 
b Melek.  And  it  came  to  pass  that 
he was never heard of more; as to 
his death or burial we know not of.
19 Behold, this we know, that he 
was a righteous man; and the say-
ing went abroad in the church that 
he was taken up by the a Spirit, or 
b buried  by  the  hand  of  the  Lord, 
even as Moses. But behold, the scrip-
tures saith the Lord took Moses unto  
himself;  and  we  suppose  that  he 
has also received Alma in the spirit, 
unto  himself;  therefore,  for  this 
cause we know nothing concerning 
his death and burial.
