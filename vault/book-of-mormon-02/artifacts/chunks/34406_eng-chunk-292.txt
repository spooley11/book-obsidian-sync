31 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should do as ye have hitherto 
done. As ye have kept my command-
ments, and also the commandments 
of my father, and have prospered, 
and have been kept from falling into 
the hands of your enemies, even so 
if ye shall keep the commandments 
of my son, or the commandments of 
God which shall be delivered unto 
you by him, ye shall prosper in the 
land, and your enemies shall have 
no power over you.

32 But, O my people, beware lest 
there shall arise a contentions among 
you, and ye  b list to  c obey the evil 
spirit, which was spoken of by my 
father Mosiah.

33 For behold, there is a wo pro-
nounced upon him who listeth to

a obey  that  spirit;  for  if  he  listeth 
to  obey  him,  and  remaineth  and 
dieth  in  his  b sins,  the  same  drin-
keth  c damnation  to  his  own  soul; 
for  he  receiveth  for  his  wages  an 
d everlasting  e punishment,  having 
transgressed  the  law  of  God  con-
trary to his own knowledge.

34 I say unto you, that there are not 
any among you, except it be your 
little children that have not been 
taught concerning these things, but 
what knoweth that ye are eternally 
a indebted to your heavenly Father, 
to render to him b all that you have 
and are; and also have been taught 
concerning the c records which con-
tain the prophecies which have been 
spoken by the holy prophets, even 
down to the time our father, Lehi, 
left Jerusalem;

35 And  also,  all  that  has  been 
spoken  by  our  fathers  until  now. 
And behold, also, they spake that 
which  was  commanded  them  of 
the Lord; therefore, they are  a just  
and true.

36 And  now,  I  say  unto  you,  my 
brethren, that after ye have known 
and  have  been  taught  all  these 
things, if ye should transgress and 
go a contrary to that which has been 
spoken, that ye do b withdraw your-
selves from the Spirit of the Lord, 
that it may have no place in you to 
guide  you  in  wisdom’s  paths  that 
ye may be blessed, prospered, and 
preserved—
