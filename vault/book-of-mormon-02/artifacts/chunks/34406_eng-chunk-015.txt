6 And it came to pass as he prayed 
unto the Lord, there came a a pillar 
of fire and dwelt upon a rock before 
him; and he saw and heard much; 
and because of the things which he 
saw and heard he did b quake and 
tremble exceedingly.

7 And it came to pass that he re-
turned  to  his  own  house  at  Jeru-
salem;  and  he  cast  himself  upon 
his bed, being a overcome with the 
Spirit and the things which he had  
seen.

8 And being thus overcome with 
the  Spirit,  he  was  carried  away 
in a  a vision, even that he saw the 
b heavens open, and he thought he 
c saw God sitting upon his throne, 
surrounded with numberless con-
courses  of  angels  in  the  attitude 
of singing and praising their God.
9 And it came to pass that he saw 
One  descending  out  of  the  midst 
of heaven, and he beheld that his 
a luster  was  above  that  of  the  sun 
at noon-day.

10 And he also saw a twelve others 
following him, and their brightness 
did exceed that of the stars in the 
firmament.

11 And they came down and went 
forth upon the face of the earth; and 
the first came and a stood before my 
father, and gave unto him a b book, 
and bade him that he should read.
12 And it came to pass that as he

read, he was filled with the a Spirit 
of the Lord.

13 And  he  read,  saying:  Wo,  wo, 
unto  Jerusalem,  for  I  have  seen 
thine a abominations! Yea, and many 
things did my father read concern-
ing  b Jerusalem—that  it  should  be 
destroyed,  and  the  inhabitants 
thereof; many should perish by the 
sword, and many should be c carried 
away captive into Babylon.

14 And it came to pass that when 
my father had read and seen many 
great and marvelous things, he did 
exclaim many things unto the Lord; 
such  as:  Great  and  marvelous  are 
thy works, O Lord God Almighty! 
Thy throne is high in the heavens, 
and thy a power, and goodness, and 
mercy are over all the inhabitants 
of the earth; and, because thou art 
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those 
who b come unto thee that they shall 
perish!
