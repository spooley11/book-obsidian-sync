33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  did  cause  the  a serpents  that 
they should pursue them no more, 
but that they should hedge up the 
way that the people could not pass, 
that whoso should attempt to pass 
might fall by the poisonous serpents.
34 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people did follow the course of the 
beasts, and did devour the a carcasses  
of them which fell by the way, until 
they had devoured them all. Now 
when the people saw that they must 
b perish they began to c repent of their 
iniquities and cry unto the Lord.

35 And it came to pass that when 
they had a humbled themselves suffi-
ciently before the Lord he did send 
rain upon the face of the earth; and 
the people began to revive again, 
and there began to be fruit in the 
north countries, and in all the coun-
tries round about. And the Lord did 
show forth his power unto them in 
preserving them from famine.

One king succeeds another—Some of the 
kings are righteous; others are wicked—
When righteousness prevails, the people 
are blessed and prospered by the Lord.

ETHER 10  : 2–13

a Heth had perished by the famine, 
and all his household save it were 
Shez—wherefore,  Shez  began  to 
build up again a broken people.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Shez 
did  remember  the  destruction  of 
his fathers, and he did build up a 
righteous kingdom; for he remem-
bered what the Lord had done in 
bringing  Jared  and  his  brother 
a across the deep; and he did walk 
in the ways of the Lord; and he be-
gat sons and daughters.

3 And his eldest son, whose name 
was  Shez,  did  a rebel  against  him; 
nevertheless, Shez was smitten by 
the hand of a robber, because of his 
exceeding  riches,  which  brought 
peace again unto his father.
