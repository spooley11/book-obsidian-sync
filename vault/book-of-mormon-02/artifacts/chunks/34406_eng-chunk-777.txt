3 Therefore  they  did  forsake  all 
their sins, and their abominations, 
and their whoredoms, and did serve  
God with all diligence day and night.
4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when  they  had  taken  all  the  rob-
bers prisoners, insomuch that none 
did escape who were not slain, they 
did cast their prisoners into prison, 
and did cause the word of God to be 
preached unto them; and as many 
as would repent of their sins and 
a enter  into  a  b covenant  that  they 
would murder no more were set at  
c liberty.

5 But as many as there were who 
did not enter into a covenant, and 
who did still continue to have those 
a secret murders in their hearts, yea, 
as many as were found breathing 
out threatenings against their breth-
ren were condemned and punished 
according to the law.

6 And  thus  they  did  put  an  end

to  all  those  wicked,  and  secret, 
and  abominable  combinations, 
in  the  which  there  was  so  much 
wickedness, and so many murders 
committed.

7 And  thus  had  the  a twenty  and 
second year passed away, and the 
twenty and third year also, and the 
twenty and fourth, and the twenty 
and fifth; and thus had twenty and 
five years passed away.

8 And there had many things tran-
spired which, in the eyes of some, 
would be great and marvelous; nev-
ertheless, they cannot all be written 
in this book; yea, this book cannot 
contain  even  a  a hundredth  part 
of what was done among so many 
people in the space of twenty and 
five years;

9 But  behold  there  are  a records 
which do contain b all the proceed-
ings of this people; and a c shorter  
but  true  account  was  given  by 
Nephi.

10 Therefore  I  have  made  my 
a record  of  these  things  according 
to the record of Nephi, which was 
engraven on the plates which were 
called the b plates of Nephi.

11 And  behold,  I  do  make  the 
record on plates which I have made 
with mine own hands.

12 And behold, I am called a Mor-
mon, being called after the b land of 
Mormon, the land in which Alma 
did establish the church among the 
people, yea, the first church which 
was established among them after 
their transgression.
