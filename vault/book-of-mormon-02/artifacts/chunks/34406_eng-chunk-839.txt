46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all 
these things shall surely come, even 
as the Father hath commanded me. 
Then shall this covenant which the 
Father  hath  covenanted  with  his 
people be fulfilled; and then shall 
a Jerusalem be inhabited again with 
my people, and it shall be the land 
of their inheritance.

CHAPTER 21
Israel will be gathered when the Book 
of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles 
will be established as a free people in 
America—They  will  be  saved  if  they 
believe and obey; otherwise, they will 
be  cut  off  and  destroyed—Israel  will 
build the New Jerusalem, and the lost 
tribes will return. About a.d. 34.
And  verily  I  say  unto  you,  I  give 
unto you a a sign, that ye may know 
the  b time when these things shall 
be about to take place—that I shall 
gather in, from their long disper-
sion, my people, O house of Israel,

and  shall  establish  again  among 
them my Zion;

2 And  behold,  this  is  the  thing 
which  I  will  give  unto  you  for  a 
sign—for verily I say unto you that 
a when  these  things  which  I  de-
clare unto you, and which I shall  
declare unto you hereafter of my-
self, and by the power of the Holy 
Ghost which shall be given unto you 
of the Father, shall be made known  
unto  the  Gentiles  that  they  may 
know concerning this people who 
are a remnant of the house of Jacob, 
and concerning this my people who 
shall be scattered by them;

3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when  
these things shall be made a known 
unto them of the Father, and shall 
come  forth  of  the  Father,  b from 
them unto you;

4 For  it  is  wisdom  in  the  Father 
that they should be established in 
this land, and be set up as a a free 
people by the power of the Father, 
that these things might come forth 
from them unto a remnant of your 
seed,  that  the  b covenant  of  the 
Father may be fulfilled which he 
hath  covenanted  with  his  people, 
O house of Israel;

5 Therefore, when these works and 
the works which shall be wrought 
among  you  hereafter  shall  come 
forth a from the Gentiles, unto your 
b seed which shall dwindle in unbe-
lief because of iniquity;
