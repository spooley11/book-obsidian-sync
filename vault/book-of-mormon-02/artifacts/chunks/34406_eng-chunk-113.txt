11 Yea,  he  will  bring  a other  na-
tions unto them, and he will give 
unto them power, and he will take 
away from them the lands of their 
possessions, and he will cause them 
to be b scattered and smitten.

12 Yea, as one generation passeth 
to  another  there  shall  be  a blood-
sheds, and great visitations among 
them; wherefore, my sons, I would 
that  ye  would  remember;  yea,  I 
would that ye would hearken unto  
my words.

13 O that ye would awake; awake 
from a deep a sleep, yea, even from 
the  sleep  of  b hell,  and  shake  off 
the awful c chains by which ye are 
bound, which are the chains which 
bind the children of men, that they 
are carried away captive down to the  
eternal d gulf of misery and woe.

2 NEPHI 1  : 14–24

14 Awake! and arise from the dust, 
and hear the words of a trembling 
a parent, whose limbs ye must soon 
lay  down  in  the  cold  and  silent 
b grave,  from  whence  no  traveler 
can c return; a few more d days and 
I go the e way of all the earth.

15 But behold, the Lord hath a re-
deemed my soul from hell; I have 
beheld his b glory, and I am encircled 
about eternally in the c arms of his 
d love.

16 And I desire that ye should re-
member to observe the a statutes and 
the judgments of the Lord; behold, 
this  hath  been  the  anxiety  of  my 
soul from the beginning.
