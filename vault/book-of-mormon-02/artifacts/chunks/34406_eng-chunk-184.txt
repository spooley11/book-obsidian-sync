32 As yet shall he remain at a Nob 
that day; he shall shake his hand 
against the mount of the daughter 
of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of 
Hosts  shall  lop  the  bough  with 
terror; and the  a high ones of stat-
ure shall be b hewn down; and the 
c haughty shall be humbled.

34 And  he  shall  cut  down  the 
thickets of the forests with iron, and 
Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

CHAPTER 21
The  stem  of  Jesse  (Christ)  will  judge 
in  righteousness—The  knowledge  of 
God will cover the earth in the Millen-
nium—The Lord will raise an ensign 
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 11. 
About 559–545 b.c.

a And there shall b come forth a rod 
out  of  the  c stem  of  Jesse,  and  a 
d branch shall grow out of his roots.
2 And the a Spirit of the Lord shall 
rest  upon  him,  the  spirit  of  b wis-
dom and c understanding, the spirit 
of counsel and might, the spirit of 
knowledge  and  of  the  fear  of  the 
Lord;

3 And  shall  make  him  of  quick 
understanding  in  the  fear  of  the 
Lord; and he shall not a judge after 
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove 
after the hearing of his ears.

4 But with a righteousness shall he 
b judge the poor, and reprove with 
equity for the  c meek of the earth; 
and he shall d smite the earth with 
the e rod of his mouth, and with the  
breath of his lips shall he slay the 
wicked.

5 And a righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness 
the girdle of his reins.

6 The a wolf also shall dwell with 
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie 
down with the kid, and the calf and 
the young lion and fatling together; 
and a little child shall lead them.

7 And the cow and the bear shall 
feed;  their  young  ones  shall  lie 
down together; and the lion shall 
eat straw like the ox.

8 And the sucking child shall play 
on  the  hole  of  the  asp,  and  the 
weaned  child  shall  put  his  hand 
on the cockatrice’s den.

9 They shall a not hurt nor b destroy 
in  all  my  holy  mountain,  for  the 
c earth shall be full of the d knowledge

27 a  Isa. 14:25.
