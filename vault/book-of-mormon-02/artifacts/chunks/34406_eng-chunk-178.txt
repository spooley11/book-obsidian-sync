CHAPTER 19
Isaiah speaks messianically—The peo-
ple in darkness will see a great light—
Unto  us  a  child  is  born—He  will  be 
the Prince of Peace and will reign on 
David’s  throne—Compare  Isaiah  9. 
About 559–545 b.c.
a Nevertheless, the dimness shall 
not be such as was in her vexation, 
when at first he lightly afflicted the 
b land of c Zebulun, and the land of 
d Naphtali, and afterwards did more 
grievously afflict by the way of the 
Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee 
of the nations.

2 The people that walked in dark-
ness  have  seen  a  great  light;  they 
that dwell in the land of the shadow 
of death, upon them hath the light 
shined.

3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, 
and  a increased  the  joy—they  joy 
before thee according to the joy in 
harvest, and as men rejoice when 
they divide the spoil.

4 For thou hast broken the yoke 
of a his burden, and the staff of his 
shoulder, the rod of his b oppressor.
5 For every battle of the warrior is 
with confused noise, and garments 
rolled in blood; but  a this shall be 
with burning and fuel of fire.

6 For unto us a a child is born, unto 
us a son is given; and the b govern-
ment  shall  be  upon  his  shoulder; 
and his name shall be called, Won-
derful, Counselor, The c Mighty God, 
The d Everlasting Father, The Prince 
of e Peace.

7 Of the increase of a government 
and  peace  b there  is  no  end,  upon 
the throne of c David, and upon his 
kingdom to order it, and to estab-
lish it with judgment and with jus-
tice from henceforth, even forever. 
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will 
perform this.

8 The Lord sent his word unto Ja-
cob and it hath lighted upon Israel.
9 And all the people shall know, 
even Ephraim and the inhabitants 
of  Samaria,  that  say  in  the  pride 
and stoutness of heart:
