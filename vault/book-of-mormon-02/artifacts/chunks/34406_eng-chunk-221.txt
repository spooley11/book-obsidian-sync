6 And then shall they rejoice; for 
they shall a know that it is a blessing 
unto them from the hand of God; 
and their b scales of darkness shall 
begin to fall from their eyes; and 
many  generations  shall  not  pass 
away among them, save they shall 
be a pure and a c delightsome people.
7 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
the a Jews which are scattered also 
shall b begin to believe in Christ; and 
they shall begin to gather in upon 
the face of the land; and as many 
as shall believe in Christ shall also 
become a delightsome people.

8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
the Lord God shall commence his 
work among all nations, kindreds, 
tongues, and people, to bring about 
the a restoration of his people upon 
the earth.

9 And with righteousness shall the 
a Lord God b judge the poor, and re-
prove with equity for the c meek of 
the earth. And he shall smite the 
earth with the rod of his mouth; and 
with the breath of his lips shall he 
slay the wicked.

10 For the a time speedily cometh 
that  the  Lord  God  shall  cause  a 
great  b division among the people, 
and the wicked will he c destroy; and 
he will d spare his people, yea, even 
if it so be that he must e destroy the 
wicked by fire.

11 And a righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness 
the girdle of his reins.

12 a And then shall the wolf dwell 
with  the  lamb;  and  the  leopard 
shall  lie  down  with  the  kid,  and

the  calf,  and  the  young  lion,  and 
the  fatling,  together;  and  a  little 
child shall lead them.

13 And the cow and the bear shall 
feed;  their  young  ones  shall  lie 
down together; and the lion shall 
eat straw like the ox.

14 And  the  sucking  child  shall 
play on the hole of the asp, and the 
weaned child shall put his hand on 
the cockatrice’s den.

15 They shall not hurt nor destroy 
in all my holy  a mountain; for the 
earth  shall  be  full  of  the  b knowl-
edge of the Lord as the waters cover 
the sea.
