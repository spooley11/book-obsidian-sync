2 Now  their  dead  were  not  num-
bered  because  of  the  greatness  of 
their numbers; neither were the dead 
of  the  Nephites  numbered—but  it 
came to pass after they had buried 
their dead, and also after the days of 
a fasting, and b mourning, and prayer, 
(and it was in the sixteenth year of 
the reign of the judges over the peo-
ple of Nephi) there began to be con-
tinual peace throughout all the land.
3 Yea, and the people did observe 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord;  and  they  were  strict  in  ob-
serving  the  a ordinances  of  God, 
according to the law of Moses; for 
they were taught to b keep the law 
of Moses until it should be fulfilled.
4 And  thus  the  people  did  have 
no disturbance in all the sixteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.

5 And it came to pass that in the 
commencement of the seventeenth 
year of the reign of the judges, there 
was continual peace.

6 But it came to pass in the latter  
end of the seventeenth year, there 
came  a  man  into  the  land  of

Zarahemla, and he was a Anti-Christ, 
for he began to preach unto the peo-
ple b against the prophecies which 
had been spoken by the prophets, 
concerning the coming of Christ.

7 Now there was no law against a 
a man’s b belief; for it was strictly con-
trary to the commands of God that  
there should be a law which should 
bring men on to unequal grounds.

if he believed in God it was his priv-
ilege to serve him; but if he did not 
believe in him there was no law to 
punish him.
