Behold, this is the thing which doth 
trouble me.

6 And also, what is this that Am-
mon said—a If ye will repent ye shall 
be saved, and if ye will not repent, 
ye shall be cast off at the last day ?
7 And  Aaron  answered  him  and 
said unto him: Believest thou that 
there is a God? And the king said: I 
know that the Amalekites say that 
there is a God, and I have granted 
unto them that they should build 
sanctuaries, that they may assem-
ble themselves together to worship 
him. And if now thou sayest there 
is a God, behold I will a believe.

8 And now when Aaron heard this, 
his heart began to rejoice, and he 
said: Behold, assuredly as thou liv-
est, O king, there is a God.

9 And the king said: Is God that 
a Great  Spirit  that  brought  our 
fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?
10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, 
he is that Great Spirit, and he a cre-
ated all things both in heaven and 
in earth. Believest thou this?

11 And he said: Yea, I believe that 
the Great Spirit created all things, 
and I desire that ye should tell me 
concerning all these things, and I 
will a believe thy words.

12 And it came to pass that when 
Aaron  saw  that  the  king  would 
believe his words, he began from 
the creation of Adam, a reading the 
scriptures unto the king—how God 
b created man after his own image, 
and that God gave him command-
ments, and that because of trans-
gression, man had fallen.

13 And Aaron did expound unto 
him  the  scriptures  from  the  a cre-
ation of Adam, laying the fall of man

before him, and their carnal state 
and also the b plan of c redemption, 
which was prepared d from the foun-
dation of the world, through Christ, 
for all whosoever would believe on 
his name.
