brought to see your a nakedness be-
fore God, and also the glory of God, 
and the b holiness of Jesus Christ, it 
will kindle a flame of unquench-
able fire upon you.

6 O then ye a unbelieving, b turn ye 
unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the 
Father  in  the  name  of  Jesus,  that 
perhaps ye may be found spotless,

MORMON 9  : 7–17

c pure, fair, and white, having been 
cleansed by the blood of the d Lamb, 
at that great and last day.

7 And again I speak unto you who 
a deny the revelations of God, and say 
that they are done away, that there 
are no revelations, nor prophecies, 
nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking  
with tongues, and the b interpreta-
tion of tongues;

8 Behold I say unto you, he that 
denieth these things knoweth not 
the a gospel of Christ; yea, he has not 
read the scriptures; if so, he does 
not b understand them.

9 For do we not read that God is the 
a same b yesterday, today, and forever, 
and in him there is no c variableness 
neither shadow of changing?

10 And now, if ye have imagined 
up unto yourselves a god who doth 
vary, and in whom there is shadow 
of changing, then have ye imagined 
up unto yourselves a god who is not 
a God of miracles.

11 But behold, I will show unto you 
a  God  of  a miracles,  even  the  God 
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, 
and the God of Jacob; and it is that 
same b God who created the heavens 
and the earth, and all things that  
in them are.
