5 And now the afflictions of the 
Nephites were great, and there was 
no way that they could deliver them-
selves  out  of  their  hands,  for  the 
Lamanites had  a surrounded them 
on every side.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people began to murmur with the 
king  because  of  their  afflictions; 
and  they  began  to  be  desirous  to 
go against them to battle. And they 
did afflict the king sorely with their 
complaints;  therefore  he  granted 
unto them that they should do ac-
cording to their desires.

7 And  they  gathered  themselves 
together  again,  and  put  on  their 
armor, and went forth against the

Lamanites to drive them out of their  
land.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did beat them, and drove 
them back, and a slew many of them.
9 And  now  there  was  a  great 
a mourning and lamentation among 
the  people  of  Limhi,  the  widow 
mourning  for  her  husband,  the 
son  and  the  daughter  mourning 
for  their  father,  and  the  brothers 
for their brethren.

10 Now there were a great many 
a widows in the land, and they did 
cry mightily from day to day, for 
a great fear of the Lamanites had 
come upon them.

11 And it came to pass that their 
continual cries did stir up the re-
mainder of the people of Limhi to 
anger  against  the  Lamanites;  and 
they went again to battle, but they 
were driven back again, suffering 
much loss.

12 Yea, they went again even the 
third time, and suffered in the like 
manner;  and  those  that  were  not 
slain returned again to the city of 
Nephi.

13 And  they  did  humble  them-
selves even to the dust, subjecting 
themselves to the a yoke of bondage, 
b submitting themselves to be smit-
ten, and to be driven to and fro, and 
burdened, according to the desires 
of their enemies.

14 And  they  did  a humble  them-
selves  even  in  the  depths  of  hu-
mility; and they did cry mightily 
to God; yea, even all the day long 
did  they  cry  unto  their  God  that 
he would b deliver them out of their  
afflictions.

15 And  now  the  Lord  was  a slow 
to hear their cry because of their 
iniquities;  nevertheless  the  Lord
