ALMA 9  : 1–15

And  again,  I,  Alma,  having  been 
commanded  of  God  that  I  should 
take  Amulek  and  go  forth  and 
preach again unto this people, or 
the people who were in the city of 
a Ammonihah, it came to pass as I 
began  to  preach  unto  them,  they 
began to contend with me, saying:
2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we 
shall believe the testimony of a one 
man,  although  he  should  preach 
unto us that the earth should pass 
away ?

3 Now  they  understood  not  the 
words which they spake; for they 
knew  not  that  the  earth  should 
pass away.

4 And they said also: We will not 
believe thy words if thou shouldst 
prophesy that this great city should 
be destroyed in a one day.

5 Now  they  knew  not  that  God 
could  do  such  marvelous  a works, 
for they were a hard-hearted and 
a stiffnecked people.

6 And they said: a Who is God, that 
sendeth b no more authority than one 
man among this people, to declare 
unto them the truth of such great 
and marvelous things?

7 And they stood forth to lay their 
hands on me; but behold, they did 
not. And I stood with boldness to 
declare unto them, yea, I did boldly 
testify unto them, saying:

8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse 
a generation, how have ye forgotten 
the b tradition of your fathers; yea, 
how  soon  ye  have  forgotten  the 
commandments of God.

9 Do  ye  not  remember  that  our 
father, Lehi, was brought out of Je-
rusalem by the  a hand of God? Do 
ye not remember that they were all 
led by him through the wilderness?
10 And have ye forgotten so soon

how many times he a delivered our 
fathers  out  of  the  hands  of  their 
enemies, and preserved them from 
being destroyed, even by the hands 
of their own brethren?

11 Yea, and if it had not been for 
his matchless power, and his mercy, 
and his a long-suffering towards us, 
we should unavoidably have been 
cut off from the face of the earth 
long before this period of time, and 
perhaps been consigned to a state 
of b endless misery and woe.
