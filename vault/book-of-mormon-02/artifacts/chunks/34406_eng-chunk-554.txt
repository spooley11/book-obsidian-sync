CHAPTER 34
Amulek  testifies  that  the  word  is  in 
Christ  unto  salvation —Unless  an 
atonement is made, all mankind must 
perish—The whole law of Moses points 
toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—
The eternal plan of redemption is based 
on faith and repentance—Pray for tem-
poral and spiritual blessings—This life 
is the time for men to prepare to meet 
God—Work  out  your  salvation  with 
fear before God. About 74 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
Alma had spoken these words unto 
them he sat down upon the ground, 
and  a Amulek  arose  and  began  to 
teach them, saying:

2 My  brethren,  I  think  that  it  is 
impossible that ye should be igno-
rant of the things which have been 
spoken concerning the coming of 
Christ,  who  is  taught  by  us  to  be 
the  Son  of  God;  yea,  I  know  that 
a these things were taught unto you 
bountifully before your dissension 
from among us.

3 And as ye have desired of my be-
loved brother that he should make 
known  unto  you  a what  ye  should 
do, because of your afflictions; and 
he hath spoken somewhat unto you 
to prepare your minds; yea, and he 
hath exhorted you unto faith and 
to patience—

4 Yea, even that ye would have so 
much  faith  as  even  to  a plant  the

word  in  your  hearts,  that  ye  may 
try the experiment of its goodness.
5 And  we  have  beheld  that  the 
great  question  which  is  in  your 
minds is whether the word be in the 
Son of God, or whether there shall  
be a no Christ.

6 And  ye  also  beheld  that  my 
brother  has  proved  unto  you,  in 
many instances, that the  a word is 
in Christ unto salvation.

7 My brother has called upon the 
words of  a Zenos, that redemption 
cometh through the Son of God, and 
also upon the words of b Zenock; and 
also he has appealed unto c Moses, 
to prove that these things are true.
8 And now, behold, I will a testify 
unto you of myself that these things 
are true. Behold, I say unto you, that 
I  do  know  that  Christ  shall  come 
among the children of men, to take 
upon him the b transgressions of his 
people, and that he shall c atone for 
the sins of the world; for the Lord 
God hath spoken it.
