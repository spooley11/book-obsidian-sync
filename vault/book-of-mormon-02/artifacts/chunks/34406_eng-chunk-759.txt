22 And many more things did the 
people a imagine up in their hearts, 
which were foolish and b vain; and 
they were much disturbed, for Sa-

upon all the face of the land, that 
he might harden the hearts of the 
people against that which was good 
and against that which should come.
23 And  notwithstanding  the 
signs and the wonders which were 
wrought among the people of the 
Lord, and the many miracles which 
they did, Satan did get great hold 
upon the hearts of the people upon 
all the face of the land.
