28 And after God had appointed 
that these things should come unto 
man,  behold,  then  he  saw  that  it  
was  expedient  that  man  should 
know concerning the things whereof 
he had appointed unto them;

29 Therefore  he  sent  a angels  to 
converse  with  them,  who  caused 
men to behold of his glory.

30 And they began from that time 
forth to call on his name; therefore 
God a conversed with men, and made 
known unto them the b plan of re-
demption, which had been prepared 
from the c foundation of the world; 
and this he made known unto them 
according to their faith and repen-
tance and their d holy works.

31 Wherefore, he gave a command-
ments unto men, they having first 
transgressed  the  b first  command-
ments  as  to  things  which  were 
temporal,  and  becoming  as  gods, 
c knowing  good  from  evil,  placing 
themselves in a state to d act, or being 
placed in a state to act according to 
their wills and pleasures, whether 
to do evil or to do good—

32 Therefore God gave unto them 
commandments, after having made 
a known unto them the plan of re-
demption, that they should not do

evil,  the  penalty  thereof  being  a 
second b death, which was an ever-
lasting c death as to things pertain-
ing unto righteousness; for on such 
the plan of redemption could have 
no power, for the works of d justice 
could not be destroyed, according 
to the supreme e goodness of God.

33 But  God  did  call  on  men,  in 
the  name  of  his  Son,  (this  being 
the a plan of redemption which was 
laid) saying: If ye will b repent, and 
harden not your hearts, then will 
I  have  mercy  upon  you,  through 
mine Only Begotten Son;

34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, 
and hardeneth not his heart, he shall 
have claim on a mercy through mine 
Only Begotten Son, unto a b remis-
sion of his sins; and these shall en-
ter into my c rest.

35 And whosoever will harden his 
heart and will do a iniquity, behold, 
I swear in my wrath that he shall 
not enter into my rest.
