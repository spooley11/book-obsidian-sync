14 And his brethren were a wroth 
with him because they b understood 
not the dealings of the Lord; they 
were also wroth with him upon the 
waters because they hardened their 
hearts against the Lord.

15 And  again,  they  were  a wroth 
with  him  when  they  had  arrived 
in the promised land, because they 
said that he had taken the b ruling 
of  the  people  out  of  their  hands; 
and they sought to kill him.

16 And  again,  they  were  wroth 
with  him  because  he  departed 
into  the  wilderness  as  the  Lord 
had commanded him, and took the 
a records  which  were  engraven  on 
the  plates  of  brass,  for  they  said 
that he b robbed them.

17 And  thus  they  have  taught  
their children that they should hate 
them,  and  that  they  should  mur-
der them, and that they should rob  
and plunder them, and do all they 
could  to  destroy  them;  therefore 
they have an eternal hatred towards 
the children of Nephi.

18 For  this  very  cause  has  king 
Laman, by his a cunning, and lying 
craftiness,  and  his  fair  promises, 
deceived  me,  that  I  have  brought 
this  my  people  up  into  this  land, 
that  they  may  destroy  them;  yea, 
and we have suffered these many 
years in the land.

19 And now I, Zeniff, after having 
told all these things unto my people

concerning  the  Lamanites,  I  did 
stimulate them to go to battle with 
their might, putting their trust in 
the Lord; therefore, we did contend 
with them, face to face.

20 And it came to pass that we did 
drive them again out of our land; 
and  we  slew  them  with  a  great 
slaughter,  even  so  many  that  we 
did not number them.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
returned  again  to  our  own  land, 
and  my  people  again  began  to 
a tend their flocks, and to till their  
ground.

22 And now I, being old, did confer 
the kingdom upon one of my sons; 
therefore, I say no more. And may 
the Lord a bless my people. Amen.
