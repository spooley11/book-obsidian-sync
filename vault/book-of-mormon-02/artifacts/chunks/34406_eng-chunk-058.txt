is in the Lamb of God—because of 
these things which are taken away 
out of the gospel of the Lamb, an

that  the  Gentiles  who  have  gone 
forth out of captivity, and have been 
lifted up by the power of God above 
all other nations, upon the face of 
the land which is choice above all 
other lands, which is the land that

thy father that his seed should have 
for  the  a land  of  their  inheritance; 
wherefore, thou seest that the Lord 
God will not suffer that the Gentiles 
will  utterly  destroy  the  b mixture 
of thy c seed, which are among thy 
brethren.

31 Neither will he suffer that the 
Gentiles shall a destroy the seed of 
thy brethren.
