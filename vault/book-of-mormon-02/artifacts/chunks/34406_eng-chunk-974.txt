long as time shall last, or the earth 
shall stand, or there shall be one man  
upon the face thereof to be saved?
37 Behold  I  say  unto  you,  Nay; 
for it is by faith that a miracles are 
wrought; and it is by faith that an-
gels appear and minister unto men; 
wherefore,  if  these  things  have 
ceased wo be unto the children of 
men, for it is because of b unbelief, 
and all is vain.

38 For no man can be saved, ac-
cording to the words of Christ, save 
they shall have faith in his name; 
wherefore,  if  these  things  have 
ceased, then has faith ceased also; 
and awful is the state of man, for 
they are as though there had been 
no redemption made.

39 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I judge better things of you, for 
I judge that ye have faith in Christ 
because of your meekness; for if ye 
have not faith in him then ye are 
not a fit to be numbered among the 
people of his church.

40 And again, my beloved brethren, 
I would speak unto you concerning  
a hope. How is it that ye can attain 
unto faith, save ye shall have hope?
41 And  what  is  it  that  ye  shall 
a hope  for?  Behold  I  say  unto  you 
that ye shall have b hope through the 
atonement of Christ and the power 
of  his  resurrection,  to  be  raised 
unto life c eternal, and this because 
of your faith in him according to  
the promise.
