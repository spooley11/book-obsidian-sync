40 And now what evidence have ye 
that there is no a God, or that Christ  
cometh not? I say unto you that ye 
have none, save it be your word only.
41 But, behold, I have all things as 
a a testimony that these things are 
true;  and  ye  also  have  all  things 
as a testimony unto you that they 
are  true;  and  will  ye  deny  them?

Believest  thou  that  these  things 
are true?

42 Behold, I know that thou a be-
lievest, but thou art possessed with 
a  b lying  spirit,  and  ye  have  put  
c off  the  Spirit  of  God  that  it  may 
have no place in you; but the devil
