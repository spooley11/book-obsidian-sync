20 And  accordingly  the  people 
were  gathered  together.  Now  the 
number of the sons and the daugh-
ters  of  the  brother  of  Jared  were 
twenty and two souls; and the num-
ber of sons and daughters of Jared 
were twelve, he having four sons.

21 And it came to pass that they 
did number their people; and after  
that they had numbered them, they 
did desire of them the things which 
they would that they should do be-
fore they went down to their graves.
22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people  desired  of  them  that  they 
should a anoint one of their sons to 
be a king over them.

23 And now behold, this was griev-
ous unto them. And the brother of 
Jared  said  unto  them:  Surely  this 
thing a leadeth into captivity.

24 But Jared said unto his brother: 
Suffer them that they may have a 
king.  And  therefore  he  said  unto 
them: Choose ye out from among our  
sons a king, even whom ye will.

25 And it came to pass that they 
chose  even  the  firstborn  of  the 
brother of Jared; and his name was  
Pagag. And it came to pass that he  
refused  and  would  not  be  their  
a king. And the people would that 
his  father  should  constrain  him, 
but  his  father  would  not;  and  he

commanded them that they should 
constrain no man to be their king.
26 And it came to pass that they 
chose all the brothers of Pagag, and 
they would not.

27 And it came to pass that neither 
would the  a sons of Jared, even all 
save it were one; and b Orihah was 
anointed to be king over the people.
28 And he began to reign, and the 
people began to a prosper; and they 
became exceedingly rich.

29 And it came to pass that Jared

died, and his brother also.

30 And it came to pass that Ori-
hah  did  walk  humbly  before  the 
Lord, and did remember how great 
things  the  Lord  had  done  for  his 
father, and also taught his people 
how great things the Lord had done 
for their fathers.

CHAPTER 7
Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid 
usurpation  and  strife,  the  rival  king-
doms of Shule and Cohor are set up—
Prophets condemn the wickedness and 
idolatry of the people, who then repent.
