5 And there were great and mar-
velous  works  wrought  by  the  dis-
ciples  of  Jesus,  insomuch  that 
they did  a heal the sick, and  b raise 
the  dead,  and  cause  the  lame  to 
walk,  and  the  blind  to  receive 
their  sight,  and  the  deaf  to  hear; 
and  all  manner  of  c miracles  did 
they  work  among  the  children  of 
men; and in nothing did they work 
miracles save it were in the name  
of Jesus.

6 And  thus  did  the  thirty  and 
eighth year pass away, and also the 
thirty and ninth, and forty and first, 
and the forty and second, yea, even 
until forty and nine years had passed 
away, and also the fifty and first, 
and the fifty and second; yea, and 
even until fifty and nine years had  
passed away.

7 And the Lord did prosper them 
exceedingly  in  the  land;  yea,  in-
somuch  that  they  did  build  cities 
again where there had been cities  
burned.

8 Yea,  even  that  great  a city  Zara-
hemla  did  they  cause  to  be  built  
again.

9 But there were many cities which 
had been  a sunk, and waters came 
up  in  the  stead  thereof;  therefore 
these cities could not be renewed.
10 And now, behold, it came to pass 
that the people of Nephi did wax 
strong, and did multiply exceedingly  
fast, and became an exceedingly a fair  
and delightsome people.

11 And  they  were  married,  and 
given in marriage, and were blessed 
according to the multitude of the 
a promises which the Lord had made 
unto them.

12 And they did not walk any more 
after the a performances and b ordi-
nances of the c law of Moses; but they 
did walk after the commandments 
which they had received from their 
Lord and their God, continuing in 
d fasting  and  prayer,  and  in  meet-
ing together oft both to pray and 
to hear the word of the Lord.
