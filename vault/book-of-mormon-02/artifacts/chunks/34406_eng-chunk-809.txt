they love to pray, standing in the 
synagogues  and  in  the  corners  of 
the streets, that they may be seen 
of men. Verily I say unto you, they 
have their reward.

6 But  thou,  when  thou  prayest, 
enter  into  thy  closet,  and  when 
thou  hast  a shut  thy  door,  pray  to 
thy Father who is in secret; and thy 
Father, who b seeth in secret, shall 
reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not a vain 
repetitions, as the b heathen, for they 
think that they shall be heard for 
their much speaking.

8 Be  not  ye  therefore  like  unto 
them,  for  your  Father  a knoweth 
what things ye have need of before 
ye b ask him.

9 After  this  a manner  therefore 
b pray  ye:  Our  c Father  who  art  in 
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy will be done on earth as it

is in heaven.

11 And forgive us our debts, as we

forgive our debtors.

12 And a lead us not into tempta-

tion, but deliver us from evil.

13 For thine is the kingdom, and the 
power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
14 For,  if  ye  a forgive  men  their 
trespasses  your  heavenly  Father 
will also forgive you;

15 But if ye forgive not men their 
trespasses neither will your Father 
forgive your trespasses.

16 Moreover, when ye a fast be not 
as the b hypocrites, of a sad counte-
nance, for they disfigure their faces 
that they may appear unto men to 
fast. Verily I say unto you, they have  
their reward.
