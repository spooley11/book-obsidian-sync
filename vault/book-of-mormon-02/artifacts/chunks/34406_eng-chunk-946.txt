ETHER 11  : 11–12  : 2

his son, did obtain the kingdom; and 
he did reign over the people all his 
days. And he did do all manner of 
iniquity in his days, by which he 
did  cause  the  shedding  of  much 
blood; and few were his days.

11 And Ethem, being a descendant 
of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom; 
and he also did do that which was 
wicked in his days.

12 And it came to pass that in the 
days  of  Ethem  there  came  many 
prophets,  and  prophesied  again 
unto the people; yea, they did proph-
esy  that  the  Lord  would  utterly 
a destroy them from off the face of 
the earth except they repented of 
their iniquities.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people hardened their hearts, and 
would not  a hearken unto their words;  
and  the  prophets  b mourned  and 
withdrew from among the people.
14 And it came to pass that Ethem 
did execute judgment in wicked-
ness all his days; and he begat Mo-
ron. And it came to pass that Moron  
did reign in his stead; and Moron did 
that which was wicked before the  
Lord.

15 And it came to pass that there 
arose a a rebellion among the people, 
because of that secret b combination 
which was built up to get power and 
gain; and there arose a mighty man 
among them in iniquity, and gave 
battle unto Moron, in which he did 
overthrow the half of the kingdom; 
and he did maintain the half of the 
kingdom for many years.

16 And it came to pass that Moron 
did overthrow him, and did obtain 
the kingdom again.

17 And it came to pass that there 
arose another mighty man; and he 
was  a  descendant  of  the  brother 
of Jared.

18 And it came to pass that he did 
overthrow  Moron  and  obtain  the 
kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt 
in  a captivity all the remainder of 
his days; and he begat Coriantor.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  
Coriantor  dwelt  in  captivity  all 
his days.
