CHAPTER 51
The king-men seek to change the law 
and  set  up  a  king—Pahoran  and  the 
freemen are supported by the voice of 
the people—Moroni compels the king-
men to defend their country or be put 
to death—Amalickiah and the Laman-
ites capture many fortified cities—Te-
ancum  repels  the  Lamanite  invasion 
and slays Amalickiah in his tent. About  
67–66 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  in  the 
commencement of the twenty and 
fifth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, they hav-
ing established peace between the 
people  of  Lehi  and  the  people  of 
Morianton concerning their lands, 
and having commenced the twenty 
and fifth year in a peace;

2 Nevertheless, they did not long 
maintain an entire peace in the land,  
for there began to be a contention 
among the people concerning the 
chief  judge  Pahoran;  for  behold, 
there were a part of the people who 
desired that a few particular points 
of the a law should be altered.

3 But behold, Pahoran would not 
alter nor suffer the law to be altered;

therefore,  he  did  not  hearken  to 
those who had sent in their voices 
with their petitions concerning the 
altering of the law.

4 Therefore,  those  who  were  de-
sirous  that  the  law  should  be  al-
tered  were  angry  with  him,  and 
desired that he should no longer be 
chief judge over the land; therefore 
there  arose  a  warm  a dispute  con-
cerning  the  matter,  but  not  unto  
bloodshed.

5 And it came to pass that those 
who  were  desirous  that  Pahoran 
should  be  dethroned  from  the  
judgment-seat  were  called  a king-
men, for they were desirous that the 
law should be altered in a manner to 
overthrow the free government and 
to establish a b king over the land.

6 And  those  who  were  desirous 
that Pahoran should remain chief 
judge over the land took upon them 
the name of  a freemen; and thus was 
the b division among them, for the 
freemen had sworn or c covenanted 
to  maintain  their  rights  and  the 
privileges of their religion by a free 
government.
