plates, which contain these prophe-
syings and revelations, and put them 
with the remainder of my record, 
for they are choice unto me; and I 
know they will be choice unto my 
brethren.

7 And I do this for a a wise b purpose; 
for thus it whispereth me, accord-
ing to the workings of the Spirit of  
the Lord which is in me. And now, 
I  do  not  know  all  things;  but  the 
Lord c knoweth all things which are 
to  come;  wherefore,  he  d worketh 
in me to do according to his e will.
8 And my  a prayer to God is con-
cerning my brethren, that they may 
once again come to the knowledge 
of  God,  yea,  the  redemption  of 
Christ;  that  they  may  once  again 
be a b delightsome people.

9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to 
finish out my record, which I take 
from the plates of Nephi; and I make 
it according to the knowledge and 
the a understanding which God has 
given me.

10 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
after  Amaleki  had  a delivered  up 
these plates into the hands of king 
Benjamin,  he  took  them  and  put 
them with the b other plates, which 
contained records which had been 
handed down by the  c kings, from 
generation to generation until the 
days of king Benjamin.

11 And  they  were  handed  down 
from king Benjamin, from genera-
tion to generation until they have 
fallen into a my hands. And I, Mor-
mon,  pray  to  God  that  they  may 
be preserved from this time hence-
forth.  And  I  know  that  they  will

be  preserved;  for  there  are  great 
things  written  upon  them,  out  of 
which b my people and their breth-
ren shall be c judged at the great and 
last day, according to the word of 
God which is written.
