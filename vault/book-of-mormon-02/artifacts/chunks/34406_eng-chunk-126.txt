17 And the Lord hath said: I will 
raise  up  a  Moses;  and  I  will  give 
power unto him in a rod; and I will 
give judgment unto him in writing. 
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that 
he shall speak much, for I will not 
make him mighty in speaking. But 
I will a write unto him my law, by 
the finger of mine own hand; and 
I will make a b spokesman for him.
18 And  the  Lord  said  unto  me 
also: I will raise up unto the fruit of 
thy loins; and I will make for him 
a spokesman. And I, behold, I will 
give  unto  him  that  he  shall  write 
the writing of the fruit of thy loins, 
unto the fruit of thy loins; and the 
spokesman  of  thy  loins  shall  de-
clare it.

19 And the words which he shall 
write shall be the words which are 
expedient in my wisdom should go 
forth  unto  the  a fruit  of  thy  loins. 
And it shall be as if the fruit of thy 
loins had cried unto them b from the 
dust; for I know their faith.

20 And  they  shall  a cry  from  the 
b dust;  yea,  even  repentance  unto 
their  brethren,  even  after  many 
generations  have  gone  by  them. 
And it shall come to pass that their 
cry shall go, even according to the 
simpleness of their words.

21 Because  of  their  faith  their 
a words  shall  proceed  forth  out  of
