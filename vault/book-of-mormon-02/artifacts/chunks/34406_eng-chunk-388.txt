7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: 
Let  them  go  up,  for  many  shall 
believe  on  their  words,  and  they 
shall  have  eternal  life;  and  I  will 
a deliver thy sons out of the hands 
of the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that Mosiah 
granted that they might go and do 
according to their request.

9 And they a took their journey into 
the wilderness to go up to preach 
the  word  among  the  Lamanites; 
and I shall give an b account of their 
proceedings hereafter.

10 Now king Mosiah had no one to 
confer the kingdom upon, for there 
was not any of his sons who a would 
accept of the kingdom.

11 Therefore he took the records 
which were engraven on the plates 
of  a brass,  and  also  the  plates  of 
b Nephi, and all the things which he 
had kept and preserved according 
to the commandments of God, after 
having translated and caused to be 
written the records which were on 
the c plates of gold which had been 
found by the people of Limhi, which 
were delivered to him by the hand 
of Limhi;

12 And this he did because of the 
great anxiety of his people; for they 
were desirous beyond measure to 
know concerning those people a who 
had been destroyed.

13 And  now  he  translated  them 
by the means of those two a stones 
which were fastened into the two 
rims of a bow.

14 Now these things were prepared  
from  the  beginning,  and  were 
handed  down  from  generation  to 
generation, for the purpose of in-
terpreting languages;

15 And they have been kept and 
preserved by the hand of the Lord, 
that  he  should  discover  to  every 
creature  who  should  possess  the 
land  the  iniquities  and  abomina-
tions of his people;

16 And whosoever has these things 
is called a seer, after the manner of 
old times.

17 Now after Mosiah had finished 
a translating these b records, behold, 
it  gave  an  account  of  the  people 
who were c destroyed, from the time 
that  they  were  destroyed  back  to 
the building of the d great tower, at 
the time the Lord e confounded the 
language  of  the  people  and  they 
were  scattered  abroad  upon  the 
face of all the earth, yea, and even 
from that time back until the cre-
ation of Adam.
