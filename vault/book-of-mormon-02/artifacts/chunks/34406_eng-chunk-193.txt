2 For  I,  Nephi,  have  not  taught 
them many things concerning the 
manner of the Jews; for their a works 
were works of darkness, and their 
doings were doings of abominations.
3 Wherefore, I write unto my peo-
ple, unto all those that shall receive 
hereafter these things which I write, 
a that they may know the judgments 
of God, that they come upon all na-
tions, according to the word which 
he hath spoken.

4 Wherefore, hearken, O my peo-
ple, which are of the house of Is-
rael, and give ear unto my words; 
for because the words of Isaiah are 
not  plain  unto  you,  nevertheless 
they are plain unto all those that 
are filled with the a spirit of b proph-
ecy. But I give unto you a c prophecy, 
according to the spirit which is in 
me; wherefore I shall prophesy ac-
cording to the d plainness which hath 
been with me from the time that I 
came out from Jerusalem with my 
father; for behold, my soul delight-
eth in e plainness unto my people, 
that they may learn.

5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in

the words of a Isaiah, for I came out 
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath 
beheld the things of the b Jews, and 
I know that the Jews do c understand 
the things of the prophets, and there 
is  none  other  people  that  under-
stand the things which were spoken 
unto the Jews like unto them, save 
it be that they are taught after the 
manner of the things of the Jews.

6 But  behold,  I,  Nephi,  have  not 
taught my children after the man-
ner  of  the  Jews;  but  behold,  I,  of 
myself,  have  dwelt  at  Jerusalem, 
wherefore I know concerning the 
regions  round  about;  and  I  have 
made  mention  unto  my  children 
concerning the judgments of God, 
which a hath come to pass among the 
Jews, unto my children, according 
to all that which Isaiah hath spo-
ken, and I do not write them.

7 But behold, I proceed with mine 
own  prophecy,  according  to  my 
a plainness;  in  the  which  I  b know 
that no man can err; nevertheless, 
in the days that the prophecies of 
Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall 
know of a surety, at the times when 
they shall come to pass.
