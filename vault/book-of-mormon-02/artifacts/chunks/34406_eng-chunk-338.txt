MOSIAH 14  : 5–15  : 3

5 But  he  was  a wounded  for  our 
b transgressions, he was bruised for 
our iniquities; the chastisement of 
our peace was upon him; and with 
his stripes we are c healed.

6 All  we,  like  a sheep,  have  gone

cut off out of the land of the living; 
for the transgressions of my people 
was he stricken.

9 And he made his grave with the 
wicked,  and  with  the  a rich  in  his 
death; because he had done no b evil, 
neither was any deceit in his mouth.
10 Yet it pleased the Lord to a bruise

thou shalt make his soul an offer-
ing  for  sin  he  shall  see  his  b seed, 
he shall prolong his days, and the 
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper 
in his hand.

11 He shall see the travail of his 
soul,  and  shall  be  satisfied;  by 
his knowledge shall my righteous
