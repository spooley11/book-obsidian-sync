40 And they did wax strong in love 
towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem  
him more than any other man; for 
they  did  not  look  upon  him  as  a  
a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, 
for that b lucre which doth c corrupt 
the soul; for he had not exacted riches 
of them, neither had he delighted in 
the shedding of blood; but he had 
established d peace in the land, and 
he had granted unto his people that 
they  should  be  delivered  from  all 
manner of bondage; therefore they 
did  esteem  him,  yea,  exceedingly,  
beyond measure.

41 And it came to pass that they did 
a appoint b judges to rule over them, 
or to judge them according to the 
law; and this they did throughout 
all the land.

42 And it came to pass that Alma 
was appointed to be the first a chief 
judge, he being also the b high priest, 
his father having conferred the of-
fice  upon  him,  and  having  given

him the charge concerning all the 
affairs of the church.

43 And now it came to pass that 
Alma did a walk in the ways of the 
Lord, and he did keep his command-
ments, and he did judge righteous 
judgments; and there was continual 
peace through the land.

44 And thus commenced the a reign 
of the judges throughout all the land 
of  Zarahemla,  among  all  the  peo-
ple who were called the Nephites; 
and  Alma  was  the  first  and  chief  
judge.

45 And now it came to pass that 
his  father  died,  being  eighty  and 
two years old, having lived to fulfil 
the commandments of God.

46 And  it  came  to  pass  that  Mo-
siah  a died  also,  in  the  thirty  and 
third year of his reign, being b sixty 
and three years old; making in the 
whole, five hundred and nine years 
from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.
47 And thus ended the reign of the 
kings over the people of Nephi; and 
thus ended the days of Alma, who 
was the founder of their church.
