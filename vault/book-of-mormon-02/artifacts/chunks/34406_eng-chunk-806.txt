19 And behold, I have given you 
the  law  and  the  commandments 
of my Father, that ye shall believe 
in me, and that ye shall repent of 
your sins, and come unto me with a 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit. 
Behold,  ye  have  the  command-
ments before you, and the b law is  
fulfilled.

20 Therefore a come unto me and 
be  ye  saved;  for  verily  I  say  unto 
you, that except ye shall keep my 
b commandments, which I have com-
manded you at this time, ye shall 
in no case enter into the kingdom 
of heaven.

21 Ye have heard that it hath been 
said by them of old time, and it is 
also written before you, that thou 
shalt not a kill, and whosoever shall 
kill shall be in danger of the judg-
ment of God;

22 But I say unto you, that whoso-
ever is a angry with his brother shall 
be in danger of his judgment. And 
whosoever shall say to his brother, 
Raca,  shall  be  in  danger  of  the 
council;  and  whosoever  shall  say, 
Thou  fool,  shall  be  in  danger  of  
hell fire.

23 Therefore,  a if  ye  shall  come 
unto  me,  or  shall  desire  to  come 
unto me, and rememberest that thy 
brother hath aught against thee—
24 Go thy way unto thy brother, and 
first be a reconciled to thy brother,

and then come unto me with full 
b purpose  of  heart,  and  I  will  re-
ceive you.

25 a Agree  with  thine  adversary 
quickly while thou art in the way 
with him, lest at any time he shall 
get thee, and thou shalt be cast into  
prison.

26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
thou shalt by no means come out 
thence until thou hast paid the ut-
termost senine. And while ye are in 
prison can ye pay even one a senine? 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.
27 Behold, it is written by them of 
old time, that thou shalt not com-
mit a adultery;

28 But I say unto you, that whoso-
ever looketh on a woman, to  a lust 
after her, hath committed adultery 
already in his heart.

29 Behold, I give unto you a com-
mandment,  that  ye  suffer  a none 
of these things to enter into your 
b heart;
