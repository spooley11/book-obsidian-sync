ETHER 12  : 28–41

28 Behold,  I  will  show  unto  the 
Gentiles their weakness, and I will 
show  unto  them  that  a faith,  hope 
and charity bringeth unto me—the 
fountain of all b righteousness.

29 And  I,  Moroni,  having  heard 
these  words,  was  a comforted,  and 
said: O Lord, thy righteous will be 
done, for I know that thou workest 
unto the children of men according 
to their faith;

30 For  the  brother  of  Jared  said 
unto  the  mountain  Zerin,  a Re-
move—and it was removed. And if 
he had not had faith it would not 
have moved; wherefore thou work-
est after men have faith.

31 For  thus  didst  thou  manifest 
thyself unto thy disciples; for a after 
they had  b faith, and did speak in 
thy name, thou didst show thyself 
unto them in great power.

32 And I also remember that thou 
hast said that thou hast prepared a 
house for man, yea, even among the 
a mansions of thy Father, in which 
man might have a more excellent 
b hope; wherefore man must hope, 
or  he  cannot  receive  an  inheri-
tance in the place which thou hast  
prepared.

33 And  again,  I  remember  that 
thou hast said that thou hast a loved 
the  world,  even  unto  the  laying 
down of thy life for the world, that 
thou mightest take it again to pre-
pare a place for the children of men.
34 And now I know that this a love 
which thou hast had for the chil-
dren of men is charity; wherefore, 
except men shall have charity they 
cannot inherit that place which thou

hast prepared in the mansions of 
thy Father.
