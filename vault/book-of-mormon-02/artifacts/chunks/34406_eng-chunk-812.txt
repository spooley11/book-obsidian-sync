4 Or  how  wilt  thou  say  to  thy 
brother: Let me pull the mote out 
of thine eye—and behold, a beam 
is in thine own eye?

5 Thou  a hypocrite,  first  cast  the 
b beam  out  of  thine  own  eye;  and 
then shalt thou see clearly to cast the  
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6 Give  not  that  which  is  a holy 
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your 
pearls before swine, lest they tram-
ple them under their feet, and turn 
again and rend you.

7 a Ask, and it shall be given unto 
you; b seek, and ye shall find; knock, 
and it shall be opened unto you.

8 For every one that asketh, receiv-
eth; and he that seeketh, findeth; 
and to him that knocketh, it shall 
be opened.

9 Or  what  man  is  there  of  you, 
who, if his son ask bread, will give 
him a stone?

10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give

him a serpent?

11 If ye then, being evil, know how 
to  give  good  gifts  unto  your  chil-
dren,  how  much  more  shall  your 
Father who is in heaven give good 
things to them that ask him?

12 Therefore, all things whatsoever 
ye  would  that  men  should  do  to  
you, a do ye even so to them, for this 
is the law and the prophets.

13 Enter ye in at the a strait gate; 
for wide is the gate, and b broad is 
the way, which leadeth to destruc-
tion, and many there be who go in 
thereat;

14 Because strait is the a gate, and 
b narrow is the way, which leadeth 
unto  life,  and  c few  there  be  that 
find it.
