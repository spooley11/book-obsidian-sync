mothers and our fair daughters, and 
our children have been spared, and 
not  have  been  buried  up  in  that 
great  city  a Moronihah.  And  thus 
were  the  howlings  of  the  people 
great and terrible.

CHAPTER 9
In the darkness, the voice of Christ pro-
claims the destruction of many people 
and  cities  for  their  wickedness—He 
also proclaims His divinity, announces 
that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and 
invites men to come unto Him and be 
saved. About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that there was a 
a voice heard among all the inhabi-
tants of the earth, upon all the face 
of this land, crying:

2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo 
unto the inhabitants of the whole 
earth except they shall a repent; for 
the devil b laugheth, and his angels 
rejoice, because of the slain of the 
fair sons and daughters of my peo-
ple; and it is because of their iniq-
uity  and  abominations  that  they 
are fallen!

3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla 
have I  a burned with fire, and the 
inhabitants thereof.

4 And behold, that great city Mo-
roni have I caused to be a sunk in the  
depths of the sea, and the inhabi-
tants thereof to be drowned.

5 And behold, that great city a Mo-
ronihah have I covered with earth, 
and the inhabitants thereof, to hide 
their iniquities and their abomina-
tions from before my face, that the 
blood of the prophets and the saints 
shall not come any more unto me 
against them.

6 And  behold,  the  city  of  Gilgal 
have I caused to be sunk, and the 
inhabitants thereof to be buried up 
in the depths of the earth;

7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and 
the  inhabitants  thereof,  and  the 
city of Mocum and the inhabitants 
thereof, and the city of a Jerusalem 
and  the  inhabitants  thereof;  and 
b waters have I caused to come up 
in the stead thereof, to hide their 
wickedness and abominations from 
before my face, that the c blood of 
the  prophets  and  the  saints  shall 
d not  come  up  any  more  unto  me 
against them.
