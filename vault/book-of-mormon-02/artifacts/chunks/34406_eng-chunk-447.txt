21 And  this  Zeezrom  began  to 
question  Amulek,  saying:  Will  ye 
answer me a few questions which I 
shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a 
man who was a expert in the b devices 
of the devil, that he might destroy 
that which was good; therefore, he 
said unto Amulek: Will ye answer 
the  questions  which  I  shall  put  
unto you?

22 And  Amulek  said  unto  him: 
Yea, if it be according to the a Spirit 
of the Lord, which is in me; for I 
shall  say  nothing  which  is  con-
trary to the Spirit of the Lord. And 
Zeezrom  said  unto  him:  Behold, 
here are six onties of silver, and all 
these will I b give thee if thou wilt 
deny  the  existence  of  a  Supreme  
Being.

23 Now Amulek said: O thou a child 
of hell, why b tempt ye me? Knowest 
thou that the righteous yieldeth to 
no such temptations?

24 Believest  thou  that  there  is 
no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou 
knowest that there is a God, but thou 
lovest that a lucre more than him.
25 And  now  thou  hast  lied  be-
fore  God  unto  me.  Thou  saidst 
unto me—Behold these six onties, 
which  are  of  great  worth,  I  will 
give  unto  thee—when  thou  hadst 
it in thy heart to retain them from 
me; and it was only thy desire that 
I should deny the true and living 
God, that thou mightest have cause 
to destroy me. And now behold, for 
this great evil thou shalt have thy  
reward.

26 And  Zeezrom  said  unto  him: 
Thou sayest there is a true and liv-
ing God?

27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is

a true and living God.

28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more

than one God?

again:  How  knowest  thou  these 
things?
