7 And now, my sons, I would that 
ye  should  remember  to  a search 
them diligently, that ye may profit 
thereby; and I would that ye should 
b keep the commandments of God, 
that  ye  may  c prosper  in  the  land 
according to the  d promises which 
the Lord made unto our fathers.

8 And many more things did king 
Benjamin teach his sons, which are 
not written in this book.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
king  Benjamin  had  made  an  end 
of teaching his sons, that he waxed 
a old, and he saw that he must very 
soon  go  the  way  of  all  the  earth; 
therefore, he thought it expedient 
that he should confer the kingdom 
upon one of his sons.

10 Therefore,  he  had  Mosiah 
brought before him; and these are 
the  words  which  he  spake  unto 
him, saying: My son, I would that 
ye  should  make  a  proclamation 
throughout all this land among all

this a people, or the people of Zara-
hemla,  and  the  people  of  Mosiah 
who dwell in the land, that thereby 
they may be gathered together; for 
on the morrow I shall proclaim unto 
this  my  people  out  of  mine  own 
mouth that thou art a b king and a 
ruler  over  this  people,  whom  the 
Lord our God hath given us.

11 And moreover, I shall give this 
people a a name, that thereby they 
may be distinguished above all the 
people  which  the  Lord  God  hath 
brought out of the land of Jerusa-
lem; and this I do because they have 
been a b diligent people in keeping 
the commandments of the Lord.

12 And I give unto them a name 
that never shall be blotted out, ex-
cept it be through a transgression.
