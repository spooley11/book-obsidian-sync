2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! 
And the Lord said unto me: Stretch 
forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: 
Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to 
pass that this generation, because 
of their iniquities, shall be brought 
into  a bondage,  and  shall  be  smit-
ten on the b cheek; yea, and shall be 
driven by men, and shall be slain; 
and the vultures of the air, and the 
dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall  
devour their c flesh.

3 And it shall come to pass that the 
a life of king Noah shall be valued  
even as a garment in a hot b furnace; 
for he shall know that I am the Lord.

4 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
I  will  smite  this  my  people  with 
sore  afflictions,  yea,  with  famine 
and  with  a pestilence;  and  I  will 
cause that they shall b howl all the  
day long.

5 Yea, and I will cause that they 
shall  have  a burdens  lashed  upon 
their backs; and they shall be driven 
before like a dumb ass.

6 And it shall come to pass that I 
will send forth a hail among them, 
and it shall smite them; and they 
shall also be smitten with the b east 
wind; and c insects shall pester their 
land also, and devour their grain.

7 And they shall be smitten with a 
great pestilence—and all this will I 
do because of their a iniquities and 
abominations.

8 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  that 
except they repent I will utterly a de-
stroy them from off the face of the 
earth; yet they shall leave a b record 
behind  them,  and  I  will  preserve 
them for other nations which shall 
possess the land; yea, even this will 
I do that I may discover the abomi-
nations of this people to other na-
tions. And many things did Abinadi 
prophesy against this people.

9 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were angry with him; and they took 
him and carried him bound before 
the  king,  and  said  unto  the  king: 
Behold, we have brought a man be-
fore thee who has prophesied evil 
concerning  thy  people,  and  saith 
that God will destroy them.

10 And  he  also  prophesieth  evil 
concerning thy a life, and saith that 
thy life shall be as a garment in a 
furnace of fire.
