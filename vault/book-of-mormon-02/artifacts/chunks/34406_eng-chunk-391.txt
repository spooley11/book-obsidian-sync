should be  a judged of God than of 
man, for the judgments of God are 
always just, but the judgments of 
man are not always just.

13 Therefore, a if it were possible 
that you could have b just men to be 
your kings, who would establish the 
c laws of God, and judge this people 
according  to  his  commandments,

MOSIAH 29  : 14–26

yea, if ye could have men for your  
kings  who  would  do  even  as  my 
father  d Benjamin  did  for  this 
people—I say unto you, if this could  
always  be  the  case  then  it  would 
be expedient that ye should always 
have kings to rule over you.

14 And even I myself have labored 
with  all  the  power  and  faculties 
which  I  have  possessed,  to  teach 
you  the  commandments  of  God, 
and to establish peace throughout 
the land, that there should be no 
wars nor contentions, no stealing, 
nor plundering, nor murdering, nor 
any manner of iniquity;

15 And  whosoever  has  commit-
ted iniquity, him have I a punished 
according  to  the  crime  which  he 
has  committed,  according  to  the 
law which has been given to us by 
our fathers.

16 Now I say unto you, that because 
all men are not just it is not expe-
dient that ye should have a  a king 
or kings to rule over you.

17 For behold, how much a iniquity 
doth one b wicked king cause to be 
committed,  yea,  and  what  great 
destruction!

18 Yea, remember king Noah, his 
a wickedness and his abominations, 
and also the wickedness and abomi-
nations of his people. Behold what 
great  destruction  did  come  upon 
them;  and  also  because  of  their 
iniquities they were brought into 
b bondage.
