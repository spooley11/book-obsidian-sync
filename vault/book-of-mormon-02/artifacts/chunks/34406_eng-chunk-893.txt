and  the  Father,  yea,  the  Eternal 
Father  of  heaven,  b knoweth  your 
state;  and  he  doeth  with  you  ac-
cording to his c justice and d mercy.

CHAPTER 7

Mormon invites the Lamanites of the 
latter days to believe in Christ, accept 
His gospel, and be saved—All who be-
lieve the Bible will also believe the Book 
of Mormon. About a.d. 385.
And  now,  behold,  I  would  speak 
somewhat unto the a remnant of this 
people who are spared, if it so be 
that God may give unto them my 
words, that they may know of the 
things of their fathers; yea, I speak 
unto you, ye remnant of the house 
of Israel; and these are the words 
which I speak:

2 Know ye that ye are of the a house

of Israel.

3 Know ye that ye must come unto 
repentance, or ye cannot be saved.
4 Know ye that ye must lay down 
your weapons of war, and delight no 
more in the shedding of blood, and  
take them not again, save it be that 
God shall a command you.

5 Know ye that ye must come to 
the a knowledge of your fathers, and 
repent of all your sins and iniquities, 
and b believe in Jesus Christ, that he 
is the Son of God, and that he was 
slain by the Jews, and by the power 
of the Father he hath risen again, 
whereby  he  hath  gained  the  c vic-
tory over the grave; and also in him 
is the sting of death swallowed up.

6 And he bringeth to pass the a res-
urrection of the dead, whereby man 
must be raised to stand before his 
b judgment-seat.

7 And he hath brought to pass the 
a redemption of the b world, whereby 
he that is found c guiltless before him 
at the judgment day hath it given 
unto him to d dwell in the presence 
of God in his kingdom, to sing cease-
less praises with the e choirs above, 
unto the Father, and unto the Son, 
and unto the Holy Ghost, which are 
f one God, in a state of  g happiness 
which hath no end.
