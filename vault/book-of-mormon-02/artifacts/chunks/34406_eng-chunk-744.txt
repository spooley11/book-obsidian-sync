is  saved;  yea,  wo  unto  this  great 
city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, 
that there are many, yea, even the 
more  part  of  this  great  city,  that 
will  harden  their  hearts  against 
me, saith the Lord.

13 But blessed are they who will 
repent, for them will I spare. But 
behold, if it were not for the righ-
teous who are in this great city, be-
hold, I would cause that a fire should 
come  down  out  of  heaven  and  
b destroy it.

14 But behold, it is for the righ-
teous’  sake  that  it  is  spared.  But 
behold, the time cometh, saith the 
Lord,  that  when  ye  shall  cast  out 
the righteous from among you, then 
shall ye be a ripe for destruction; yea, 
wo be unto this great city, because 
of the wickedness and abominations 
which are in her.

15 Yea,  and  wo  be  unto  the  city 
of Gideon, for the wickedness and 
abominations which are in her.

16 Yea,  and  wo  be  unto  all  the 
cities which are in the land round 
about, which are possessed by the 
Nephites,  because  of  the  wicked-
ness and abominations which are  
in them.

17 And  behold,  a  a curse  shall 
come upon the land, saith the Lord 
of  Hosts,  because  of  the  people’s 
sake  who  are  upon  the  land,  yea, 
because  of  their  wickedness  and 
their abominations.

18 And it shall come to pass, saith 
the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and 
true  God,  that  whoso  shall  a hide 
up treasures in the earth shall find 
them again no more, because of the 
great curse of the land, save he be 
a righteous man and shall hide it 
up unto the Lord.

19 For I will, saith the Lord, that 
they shall hide up their a treasures
