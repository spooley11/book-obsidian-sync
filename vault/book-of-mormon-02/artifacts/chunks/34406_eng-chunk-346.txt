And now it came to pass that when 
Abinadi had finished these sayings, 
that the king commanded that the 
a priests should take him and cause 
that he should be put to b death.

2 But there was one among them 
whose name was a Alma, he also be-
ing a descendant of Nephi. And he 
was a young man, and he b believed 
the words which Abinadi had spo-
ken,  for  he  knew  concerning  the 
iniquity  which  Abinadi  had  tes-
tified  against  them;  therefore  he 
began to plead with the king that 
he would not be angry with Abin-
adi, but suffer that he might depart  
in peace.

3 But  the  king  was  more  wroth, 
and caused that Alma should be cast 
out from among them, and sent his 
servants after him that they might 
slay him.

4 But  he  fled  from  before  them 
and  a hid  himself  that  they  found 
him not. And he being concealed 
for  many  days  did  b write  all  the 
words which Abinadi had spoken.
5 And it came to pass that the king 
caused that his guards should sur-
round Abinadi and take him; and 
they bound him and cast him into 
prison.

6 And after three days, having coun-
seled  with  his  a priests,  he  caused 
that  he  should  again  be  brought 
before him.

7 And  he  said  unto  him:  Abin-
adi, we have found an accusation 
against thee, and thou art worthy  
of death.

8 For  thou  hast  said  that  a God 
himself should come down among
