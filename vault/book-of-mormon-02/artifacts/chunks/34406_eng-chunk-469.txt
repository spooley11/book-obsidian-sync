5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
went immediately, obeying the mes-
sage which he had sent unto them; 
and  they  went  in  unto  the  house 
unto Zeezrom; and they found him 
upon his bed, sick, being very low 
with a burning fever; and his mind 
also was a exceedingly sore because 
of his iniquities; and when he saw 
them he stretched forth his hand, 
and besought them that they would 
heal him.

6 And it came to pass that Alma 
said unto him, taking him by the 
hand: a Believest thou in the power 
of Christ unto salvation?

7 And he answered and said: Yea, 
I  believe  all  the  words  that  thou 
hast taught.

8 And Alma said: If thou believest 
in  the  redemption  of  Christ  thou 
canst be a healed.

9 And  he  said:  Yea,  I  believe  ac-

cording to thy words.

10 And then Alma cried unto the 
Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have 
a mercy on this man, and b heal him 
according to his faith which is in 
Christ.

11 And when Alma had said these 
words,  a Zeezrom  leaped  upon  his

feet, and began to walk; and this was 
done to the great astonishment of 
all the people; and the knowledge 
of this went forth throughout all the  
land of Sidom.

12 And  Alma  baptized  Zeezrom 
unto the Lord; and he began from 
that time forth to preach unto the 
people.

13 And Alma established a church 
in  the  land  of  Sidom,  and  conse-
crated a priests and b teachers in the 
land, to baptize unto the Lord who-
soever were desirous to be baptized.
14 And it came to pass that they 
were  many;  for  they  did  flock  in 
from  all  the  region  round  about 
Sidom, and were baptized.

15 But as to the people that were 
in the land of Ammonihah, they yet 
remained a hard-hearted and a stiff-
necked people; and they repented 
not of their sins, a ascribing all the 
power of Alma and Amulek to the 
devil; for they were of the profes-
sion of b Nehor, and did not believe 
in the repentance of their sins.
