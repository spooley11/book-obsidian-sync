16 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard, and also the 
servant, went down into the vine-
yard to labor. And it came to pass 
that the servant said unto his master:  
Behold, look here; behold the tree.
17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard looked and be-
held the tree in the which the wild 
olive  branches  had  been  grafted; 
and it had sprung forth and begun 
to bear a fruit. And he beheld that it 
was good; and the fruit thereof was 
like unto the natural fruit.

18 And he said unto the servant: 
Behold,  the  branches  of  the  wild 
tree have taken hold of the mois-
ture  of  the  root  thereof,  that  the 
root  thereof  hath  brought  forth 
much strength; and because of the 
much strength of the root thereof 
the  wild  branches  have  brought 
forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not 
grafted in these branches, the tree 
thereof would have perished. And 
now,  behold,  I  shall  lay  up  much 
fruit, which the tree thereof hath 
brought forth; and the fruit thereof 
I  shall  lay  up  against  the  season, 
unto mine own self.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  of  the  vineyard  said  unto 
the servant: Come, let us go to the 
nethermost  part  of  the  vineyard, 
and behold if the natural branches 
of the tree have not brought forth 
much fruit also, that I may lay up 
of the fruit thereof against the sea-
son, unto mine own self.

20 And it came to pass that they

went forth whither the master had 
hid  the  natural  branches  of  the 
tree, and he said unto the servant: 
Behold  these;  and  he  beheld  the 
a first  that  it  had  b brought  forth 
much fruit; and he beheld also that 
it was good. And he said unto the 
servant: Take of the fruit thereof, 
and  lay  it  up  against  the  season, 
that  I  may  preserve  it  unto  mine 
own self; for behold, said he, this 
long time have I nourished it, and 
it hath brought forth much fruit.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
servant said unto his master: How 
comest  thou  hither  to  plant  this 
tree, or this branch of the tree? For 
behold, it was the poorest spot in 
all the land of thy vineyard.
