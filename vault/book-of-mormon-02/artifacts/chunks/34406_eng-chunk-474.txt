the devil, and the word of God be-
ing preached in its purity in all the 
land, and the Lord pouring out his 
blessings  upon  the  people—thus 
ended  the  fourteenth  year  of  the 
reign of the judges over the people of  
Nephi.

An account of the sons of Mosiah, 
who rejected their rights to the king-
dom for the word of God, and went 
up to the land of Nephi to preach 
to the Lamanites; their sufferings 
and deliverance—according to the 
record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 17 through 27.

CHAPTER 17
The sons of Mosiah have the spirit of 
prophecy  and  of  revelation—They  go 
their several ways to declare the word 
to the Lamanites—Ammon goes to the 
land of Ishmael and becomes the ser-
vant of King Lamoni—Ammon saves 
the king’s flocks and slays his enemies 
at the water of Sebus. Verses 1–3, about 
77 b.c.; verse 4, about 91–77 b.c.; and 
verses 5–39, about 91 b.c.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  as 
Alma was journeying from the land 
of Gideon southward, away to the 
land  of  a Manti,  behold,  to  his  as-
tonishment, he b met with the c sons 
of Mosiah journeying towards the 
land of Zarahemla.

2 Now these sons of Mosiah were 
with  Alma  at  the  time  the  angel 
a first appeared unto him; therefore 
Alma  did  rejoice  exceedingly  to 
see his brethren; and what added 
more to his joy, they were still his 
brethren in the Lord; yea, and they 
had waxed strong in the knowledge 
of the truth; for they were men of

a  sound  understanding  and  they 
had  b searched  the  scriptures  dili-
gently,  that  they  might  know  the 
word of God.

3 But  this  is  not  all;  they  had 
given themselves to much prayer, 
and a fasting; therefore they had the 
spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of 
revelation, and when they taught, 
they  taught  with  b power  and  au-
thority of God.
