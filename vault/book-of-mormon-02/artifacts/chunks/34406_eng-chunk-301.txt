6 I say unto you, if ye have come 
to a a knowledge of the goodness of 
God, and his matchless power, and 
his wisdom, and his patience, and his 
long-suffering towards the children  
of  men;  and  also,  the  b atonement 
which has been prepared from the 
c foundation of the world, that thereby 
salvation  might  come  to  him  that 
should  put  his  d trust  in  the  Lord, 
and should be diligent in keeping his 
commandments, and continue in the 
faith even unto the end of his life, I 
mean the life of the mortal body—
7 I say, that this is the man who 
receiveth  salvation,  through  the 
atonement  which  was  prepared 
from the foundation of the world for 
all mankind, which ever were since 
the a fall of Adam, or who are, or who 
ever shall be, even unto the end of  
the world.

8 And this is the means whereby 
salvation cometh. And there is a none 
other salvation save this which hath 
been spoken of; neither are there 
any conditions whereby man can be 
saved except the conditions which 
I have told you.

9 Believe in a God; believe that he 
is, and that he b created all things, 
both in heaven and in earth; believe  
that  he  has  all  c wisdom,  and  all 
power, both in heaven and in earth;

believe that man doth not d compre-
hend all the things which the Lord 
can comprehend.

10 And again, believe that ye must 
a repent  of  your  sins  and  forsake 
them,  and  humble  yourselves  be-
fore God; and ask in  b sincerity of 
heart  that  he  would  c forgive  you; 
and now, if you  d believe all these 
things see that ye e do them.
