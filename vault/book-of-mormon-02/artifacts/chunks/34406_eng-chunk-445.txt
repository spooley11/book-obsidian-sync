31 And there was one among them 
whose name was Zeezrom. Now he 
was the foremost to a accuse Amu-
lek and Alma, he being one of the 
most  expert  among  them,  having 
much  business  to  do  among  the  
people.

32 Now the object of these lawyers 
was to get gain; and they got gain 
a according to their employ.

CHAPTER 11
The  Nephite  monetary  system  is  set 
forth—Amulek  contends  with  Zeez-

rom—Christ will not save people in their 
sins—Only those who inherit the king-
dom of heaven are saved—All men will 
rise in immortality—There is no death 
after the Resurrection. About 82 b.c.

Now it was in the law of Mosiah that 
every man who was a judge of the 
law, or those who were appointed 
to be judges, should receive a wages 
b according to the time which they 
labored  to  judge  those  who  were 
brought before them to be judged.
2 Now if a man owed another, and 
he  would  not  a pay  that  which  he 
did owe, he was complained of to 
the judge; and the judge executed 
authority,  and  sent  forth  officers 
that  the  man  should  be  brought 
before him; and he judged the man 
according to the law and the evi-
dences which were brought against 
him,  and  thus  the  man  was  com-
pelled to pay that which he owed, 
or be stripped, or be cast out from 
among  the  people  as  a  thief  and  
a robber.

3 And the judge received for his 
wages a according to his time—a b se-
nine of gold for a day, or a senum 
of silver, which is equal to a senine 
of gold; and this is according to the 
law which was given.

4 Now these are the names of the 
different pieces of their gold, and 
of  their  silver,  according  to  their 
value. And the names are given by 
the Nephites, for they did not reckon 
after the a manner of the Jews who 
were at Jerusalem; neither did they 
measure  after  the  manner  of  the 
Jews;  but  they  altered  their  reck-
oning and their measure, according 
to the minds and the circumstances 
of the people, in every generation, 
until the reign of the judges, they 
having  been  b established  by  king 
Mosiah.
