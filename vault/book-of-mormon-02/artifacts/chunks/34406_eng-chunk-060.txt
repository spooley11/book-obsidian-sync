1 NEPHI 13  : 38–14  : 2

shall be  f  lifted up at the last day, 
and shall be saved in the everlasting 
g kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso 
shall h publish peace, yea, tidings of 
great joy, how beautiful upon the 
mountains shall they be.

38 And it came to pass that I be-
held the remnant of the seed of my 
brethren, and also the a book of the 
Lamb of God, which had proceeded 
forth  from  the  mouth  of  the  Jew, 
that it came forth from the Gentiles 
b unto  the  remnant  of  the  seed  of 
my brethren.

39 And  after  it  had  come  forth 
unto them I beheld a other b books, 
which came forth by the power of 
the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto 
them, unto the c convincing of the 
Gentiles and the remnant of the seed 
of my brethren, and also the Jews 
who  were  scattered  upon  all  the 
face of the earth, that the records 
of the prophets and of the twelve 
apostles of the Lamb are d true.
