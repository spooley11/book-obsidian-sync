42 Wherefore, if a man have a faith 
he b must needs have hope; for with-
out faith there cannot be any hope.

43 And  again,  behold  I  say  unto 
you that he cannot have faith and 
hope, save he shall be a meek, and 
lowly of heart.

44 If so, his a faith and hope is vain, 
for none is b acceptable before God, 
save the c meek and lowly in heart; 
and if a man be meek and lowly in 
heart, and d confesses by the power 
of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the 
Christ,  he  must  needs  have  char-
ity; for if he have not charity he is 
nothing; wherefore he must needs 
have charity.

45 And a charity suffereth long, and 
is b kind, and c envieth not, and is not 
puffed up, seeketh not her own, is 
not easily  d provoked, thinketh no 
evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity 
but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth 
all things, believeth all things, hop-
eth all things, endureth all things.
46 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, if ye have not charity, ye are  
nothing, for charity never faileth. 
Wherefore,  cleave  unto  charity, 
which is the greatest of all, for all 
things must fail—

47 But  a charity  is  the  pure  b love 
of Christ, and it endureth c forever; 
and  whoso  is  found  possessed  of 
it  at  the  last  day,  it  shall  be  well 
with him.

48 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, a pray unto the Father with all 
the energy of heart, that ye may be 
filled with this love, which he hath 
bestowed  upon  all  who  are  true 
b followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; 
that  ye  may  become  the  sons  of 
God; that when he shall appear we
