of  the  people,  for  they  dwell  in 
righteousness,  and  the  Holy  One 
of Israel d reigneth.

27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say 
unto you that all these a things must 
come according to the flesh.

28 But,  behold,  all  nations,  kin-
dreds,  tongues,  and  people  shall 
dwell safely in the Holy One of Is-
rael if it so be that they will a repent.
29 And now I, Nephi, make an end; 
for I durst not speak further as yet 
concerning these things.

30 Wherefore,  my  brethren,  I

would that ye should consider that 
the things which have been written 
upon the a plates of brass are true; 
and  they  testify  that  a  man  must 
be obedient to the commandments 
of God.

31 Wherefore,  ye  need  not  sup-
pose that I and my father are the 
only ones that have testified, and 
also taught them. Wherefore, if ye 
shall be obedient to the a command-
ments, and endure to the end, ye 
shall be saved at the last day. And 
thus it is. Amen.
