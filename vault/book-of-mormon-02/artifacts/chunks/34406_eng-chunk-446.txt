ALMA 11  : 5–28

5 Now the reckoning is thus—a se-
nine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum 
of gold, and a limnah of gold.

6 A senum of silver, an amnor of 
silver,  an  ezrom  of  silver,  and  an 
onti of silver.

7 A  senum  of  silver  was  equal  
to a senine of gold, and either for 
a measure of barley, and also for a  
measure of every kind of grain.

8 Now  the  amount  of  a  seon  of 
gold was twice the value of a senine.
9 And a shum of gold was twice

the value of a seon.

10 And a limnah of gold was the

value of them all.

11 And an amnor of silver was as

great as two senums.

12 And an ezrom of silver was as

great as four senums.

13 And  an  onti  was  as  great  as

them all.

14 Now  this  is  the  value  of  the 
lesser numbers of their reckoning—
15 A  shiblon  is  half  of  a  senum; 
therefore, a shiblon for half a mea-
sure of barley.

16 And  a  shiblum  is  a  half  of  a

shiblon.

shiblum.

17 And  a  leah  is  the  half  of  a

18 Now this is their number, ac-

cording to their reckoning.

19 Now an antion of gold is equal

to three shiblons.

20 Now, it was for the sole purpose 
to get a gain, because they received 
their wages according to their b em-
ploy, therefore, they did c stir up the 
people to d riotings, and all manner 
of  disturbances  and  wickedness, 
that  they  might  have  more  em-
ploy, that they might  e get  f money 
according to the suits which were 
brought before them; therefore they 
did stir up the people against Alma 
and Amulek.
