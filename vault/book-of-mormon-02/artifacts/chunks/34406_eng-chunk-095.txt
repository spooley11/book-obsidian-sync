c God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and 
the God of Jacob, d yieldeth himself, 
according to the words of the angel, 
as a man, into the hands of e wicked 
men, to be f  lifted up, according to 
the  words  of  g Zenock,  and  to  be 
h crucified, according to the words 
of Neum, and to be buried in a i sep-
ulchre, according to the words of 
j Zenos, which he spake concerning 
the three days of k darkness, which 
should be a sign given of his death 
unto those who should inhabit the 
isles  of  the  sea,  more  especially 
given  unto  those  who  are  of  the 
l house of Israel.

11 For thus spake the prophet: The 
Lord God surely shall a visit all the 
house  of  Israel  at  that  day,  some 
with  his  b voice,  because  of  their 
righteousness, unto their great joy 
and salvation, and others with the 
c thunderings and the lightnings of 
his power, by tempest, by fire, and 
by d smoke, and e vapor of f darkness, 
and by the opening of the  g earth, 
and by h mountains which shall be 
carried up.

12 And  a all  these  things  must 
surely come, saith the prophet b Ze-
nos. And the c rocks of the earth must 
rend; and because of the d groanings 
of the earth, many of the kings of

the isles of the sea shall be wrought 
upon  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  to  ex-
claim: The God of nature suffers.

13 And  as  for  those  who  are  at 
Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they 
shall  be  a scourged  by  all  people, 
because  they  crucify  the  God  of 
Israel, and turn their hearts aside, 
rejecting  signs  and  wonders,  and 
the power and glory of the God of  
Israel.

14 And  because  they  turn  their 
hearts aside, saith the prophet, and  
have a despised the Holy One of Is-
rael, they shall wander in the flesh, 
and perish, and become a b hiss and 
a  c byword,  and  be  d hated  among 
all nations.

15 Nevertheless,  when  that  day 
cometh, saith the prophet, that they 
a no  more  b turn  aside  their  hearts 
against the Holy One of Israel, then 
will  he  remember  the  c covenants 
which he made to their fathers.
