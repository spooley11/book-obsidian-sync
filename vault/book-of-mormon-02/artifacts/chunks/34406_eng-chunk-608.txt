ALMA 46  : 11–21

unto them, or which blessing God 
had sent upon the face of the land 
for the c righteous’ sake.

11 And now it came to pass that 
when Moroni, who was the  a chief 
commander  of  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites,  had  heard  of  these  dis-
sensions, he was angry with Amal-
ickiah.

12 And it came to pass that he rent 
his coat; and he took a piece thereof, 
and wrote upon it—a In memory of 
our God, our religion, and freedom, 
and our peace, our wives, and our 
children—and he fastened it upon 
the end of a pole.

13 And he fastened on his head-
plate, and his a breastplate, and his 
shields,  and  girded  on  his  armor 
about his loins; and he took the pole, 
which had on the end thereof his 
rent coat, (and he called it the b title 
of liberty) and he c bowed himself 
to the earth, and he prayed might-
ily unto his God for the blessings 
of  liberty  to  rest  upon  his  breth-
ren, so long as there should a band 
of  d Christians  remain  to  possess  
the land—

14 For thus were all the true be-
lievers  of  Christ,  who  belonged 
to  the  church  of  God,  called  by 
those  who  did  not  belong  to  the  
church.
