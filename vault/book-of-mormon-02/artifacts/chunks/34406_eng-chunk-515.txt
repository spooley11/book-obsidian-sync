the Lamanites saw that they could 
not overpower the Nephites they re-
turned again to their own land; and 
many of them came over to dwell in 
the land of a Ishmael and the land 
of Nephi, and did join themselves 
to the people of God, who were the 
people of b Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

14 And they did also a bury their 
weapons of war, according as their 
brethren had, and they began to be 
a  righteous  people;  and  they  did 
walk in the ways of the Lord, and 
did observe to keep his command-
ments and his statutes.

15 Yea, and they did keep the law 
of Moses; for it was expedient that 
they should keep the law of Moses 
as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But 
notwithstanding the a law of Moses,  
they did look forward to the coming 
of Christ, considering that the law 
of Moses was a b type of his coming, 
and believing that they must keep 
those c outward d performances until 
the time that he should be revealed 
unto them.

16 Now  they  did  not  suppose 
that  a salvation  came  by  the  b law 
of Moses; but the law of Moses did 
serve  to  strengthen  their  faith  in 
Christ; and thus they did retain a 
c hope  through  faith,  unto  eternal 
salvation,  relying  upon  the  spirit 
of prophecy, which spake of those 
things to come.

17 And now behold, Ammon, and 
Aaron,  and  Omner,  and  Himni, 
and their brethren did rejoice ex-
ceedingly,  for  the  success  which 
they  had  had  among  the  Laman-
ites,  seeing  that  the  Lord  had 
granted  unto  them  according  to 
their a prayers, and that he had also

verified his word unto them in every  
particular.

CHAPTER 26

Ammon  glories  in  the  Lord—The  
faithful  are  strengthened  by  the  Lord 
and  are  given  knowledge—By  faith  
men  may  bring  thousands  of  souls  
unto  repentance—God  has  all  power 
and  comprehends  all  things.  About 
90–77 b.c.
And  now,  these  are  the  words  of 
Ammon to his brethren, which say 
thus: My brothers and my brethren, 
behold  I  say  unto  you,  how  great 
reason have we to rejoice; for could 
we have supposed when we a started 
from  the  land  of  Zarahemla  that 
God  would  have  granted  unto  us 
such great blessings?

2 And now, I ask, what great bless-
ings has he bestowed upon us? Can 
ye tell?
