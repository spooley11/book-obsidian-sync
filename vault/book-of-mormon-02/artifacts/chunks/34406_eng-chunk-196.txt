again the second time to a restore his 
people  from  their  lost  and  fallen 
state. Wherefore, he will proceed to 
do a b marvelous work and a wonder 
among the children of men.

18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth 
a his b words unto them, which words 
shall  c judge  them  at  the  last  day, 
for  they  shall  be  given  them  for 
the purpose of d convincing them of 
the true Messiah, who was rejected 
by them; and unto the convincing 
of  them  that  they  need  not  look 
forward  any  more  for  a  Messiah  
to come, for there should not any 
come,  save  it  should  be  a  e false 
Messiah  which  should  deceive 
the  people;  for  there  is  save  one  
f   Messiah spoken of by the prophets, 
and that Messiah is he who should 
be rejected of the Jews.

19 For according to the words of 
the prophets, the a Messiah cometh 
in  b six  hundred  years  from  the 
time that my father left Jerusalem; 
and according to the words of the 
prophets, and also the word of the 
c angel  of  God,  his  d name  shall  be 
Jesus Christ, the e Son of God.

20 And now, my brethren, I have 
spoken plainly that ye cannot err. 
And  as  the  Lord  God  liveth  that 
a brought Israel up out of the land of 
Egypt, and gave unto Moses power 
that  he  should  b heal  the  nations
