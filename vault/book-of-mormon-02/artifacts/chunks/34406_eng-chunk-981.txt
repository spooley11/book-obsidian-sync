MORONI 9  : 8–22

528

For  according  to  the  knowledge 
which I have received from Amoron, 
behold, the Lamanites have many 
prisoners, which they took from the 
tower of Sherrizah; and there were 
men, women, and children.

8 And  the  husbands  and  fathers 
of those women and children they 
have slain; and they feed the women 
upon the a flesh of their husbands, 
and the children upon the flesh of 
their fathers; and no water, save a 
little, do they give unto them.

9 And notwithstanding this great 
a abomination of the Lamanites, it 
doth not exceed that of our people 
in Moriantum. For behold, many of  
the daughters of the Lamanites have  
they taken prisoners; and after b de-
priving them of that which was most 
dear and precious above all things, 
which is c chastity and d virtue—

10 And  after  they  had  done  this 
thing, they did murder them in a 
most a cruel manner, torturing their 
bodies even unto death; and after 
they  have  done  this,  they  devour 
their  flesh  like  unto  wild  beasts, 
because  of  the  hardness  of  their 
hearts; and they do it for a token of  
bravery.

11 O my beloved son, how can a 
people  like  this,  that  are  without 
civilization—

12 (And  only  a  few  years  have 
passed away, and they were a civil 
and a delightsome people)

13 But O my son, how can a peo-
ple  like  this,  whose  a delight  is  in 
so much abomination—

14 How  can  we  expect  that  God 
will  a stay  his  hand  in  judgment 
against us?

15 Behold,  my  heart  cries:  Wo 
unto this people. Come out in judg-
ment, O God, and hide their sins, 
and wickedness, and abominations 
from before thy face!
