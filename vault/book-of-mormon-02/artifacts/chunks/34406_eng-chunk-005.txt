this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this 
work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which 
have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith 
has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the en-
gravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and 
of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of sober-
ness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted,  
and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we 
have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the  
world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

The TeSTimOny Of The  
PrOPheT JOSePh SmiTh

The Prophet Joseph Smith’s own words about the coming forth of the

Book of Mormon are:

“On the evening of the . . . twenty-first of September [1823] . . . I betook

myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God. . . .

“While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light 
appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was 
lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my 
bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.

“He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness 
beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly 
thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His 
hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were 
his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and 
neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but 
this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.
