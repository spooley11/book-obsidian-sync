22 And  inasmuch  as  thou  shalt  
keep  my  commandments,  thou  
shalt be made a a ruler and a teacher 
over thy brethren.

23 For  behold,  in  that  day  that 
they shall a rebel against me, I will 
b curse them even with a sore curse, 
and they shall have no power over

thy  seed  except  they  shall  c rebel 
against me also.

24 And if it so be that they rebel 
against me, they shall be a a scourge 
unto thy seed, to  b stir them up in 
the ways of remembrance.

CHAPTER 3
Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to ob-
tain the plates of brass—Laban refuses 
to  give  the  plates  up—Nephi  exhorts 
and  encourages  his  brethren—Laban 
steals  their  property  and  attempts  to 
slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite 
Nephi  and  Sam  and  are  reproved  by 
an angel. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
returned from a speaking with the 
Lord, to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that he spake 
unto  me,  saying:  Behold  I  have 
dreamed  a  a dream,  in  the  which 
the Lord hath commanded me that 
thou and thy brethren shall b return 
to Jerusalem.

3 For  behold,  Laban  hath  the 
record of the Jews and also a  a ge-
nealogy  of  my  forefathers,  and 
they are b engraven upon plates of  
brass.

4 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded  me  that  thou  and  thy 
brothers should go unto the house 
of Laban, and seek the records, and 
bring  them  down  hither  into  the 
wilderness.

5 And  now,  behold  thy  brothers 
murmur, saying it is a hard thing 
which I have required of them; but 
behold  I  have  not  required  it  of
