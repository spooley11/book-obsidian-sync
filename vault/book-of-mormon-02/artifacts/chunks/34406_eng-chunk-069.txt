17 And  this  is  what  our  father 
meaneth;  and  he  meaneth  that  it 
will  not  come  to  pass  until  after 
they are scattered by the Gentiles; 
and he meaneth that it shall come 
by  way  of  the  Gentiles,  that  the 
Lord may show his power unto the 
Gentiles, for the very cause that he 
shall be a rejected of the Jews, or of 
the house of Israel.

18 Wherefore, our father hath not 
spoken of our seed alone, but also 
of all the house of Israel, pointing 
to  the  covenant  which  should  be 
fulfilled in the latter days; which 
covenant  the  Lord  made  to  our 
father Abraham, saying: In thy a seed 
shall all the kindreds of the earth  
be b blessed.

1 NEPHI 15  : 19–32

32

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi, spake much unto them con-
cerning these things; yea, I spake 
unto them concerning the a restora-
tion of the Jews in the latter days.
20 And I did rehearse unto them 
the  words  of  a Isaiah,  who  spake 
b concerning the c restoration of the  
Jews, or of the house of Israel; and 
after they were restored they should 
no  more  be  confounded,  neither 
should  they  be  scattered  again. 
And it came to pass that I did speak 
many words unto my brethren, that 
they were pacified and did d humble 
themselves before the Lord.
