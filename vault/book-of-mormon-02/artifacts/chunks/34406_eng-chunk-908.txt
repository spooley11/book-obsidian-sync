35 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did cry unto the 
Lord, and the Lord had compassion 
upon  Jared;  therefore  he  did  not 
confound  the  a language  of  Jared; 
and Jared and his brother were not 
confounded.

36 Then  Jared  said  unto  his 
brother: Cry again unto the Lord, 
and it may be that he will turn away 
his anger from them who are our 
a friends, that he confound not their  
language.

37 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
brother of Jared did cry unto the 
Lord, and the Lord had compassion

were found by the people of Limhi, 
which is called the Book of Ether.
3 And as I suppose that the a first 
part  of  this  record,  which  speaks 
concerning  the  creation  of  the 
world,  and  also  of  Adam,  and  an 
account from that time even to the 
great b tower, and whatsoever things 
transpired among the children of 
men until that time, is had among 
the Jews—

4 Therefore  I  do  not  write  those 
things which transpired from the 
a days of Adam until that time; but 
they are had upon the plates; and 
whoso findeth them, the same will 
have power that he may get the full 
account.

5 But  behold,  I  give  not  the  full 
account, but a a part of the account 
I give, from the tower down until 
they were destroyed.

6 And on this wise do I give the 
account. He that wrote this record 
was  a Ether,  and  he  was  a  descen-
dant of Coriantor.

7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.
8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.
9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.
10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.
11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.
12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.
13 And Com was the son of Cori-

antum.

14 And Coriantum was the son of

Amnigaddah.

15 And Amnigaddah was the son

of Aaron.

16 And Aaron was a descendant of 
Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.
17 And Hearthom was the son of

Lib.

18 And Lib was the son of Kish.
19 And Kish was the son of Corom.
20 And Corom was the son of Levi.
21 And Levi was the son of Kim.
22 And  Kim  was  the  son  of

Morianton.
