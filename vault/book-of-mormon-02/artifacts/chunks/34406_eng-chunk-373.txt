23 And  now  the  Lord  said  unto 
Alma: Haste thee and get thou and 
this people out of this land, for the 
Lamanites have awakened and do 
pursue thee; therefore get thee out 
of  this  land,  and  I  will  stop  the 
Lamanites in this valley that they 
come no further in pursuit of this  
people.

24 And it came to pass that they 
departed out of the valley, and took 
their journey into the wilderness.
25 And  after  they  had  been  in 
the  wilderness  a twelve  days  they 
arrived in the land of Zarahemla; 
and king Mosiah did also b receive 
them with joy.

CHAPTER 25
The descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla 
become  Nephites—They  learn  of  the 
people  of  Alma  and  of  Zeniff—Alma 
baptizes  Limhi  and  all  his  people— 
Mosiah authorizes Alma to organize the 
Church of God. About 120 b.c.
And now king Mosiah caused that 
all the people should be gathered 
together.

2 Now there were not so many of 
the children of Nephi, or so many 
of those who were descendants of

MOSIAH 25  : 3–17

Nephi, as there were of the a people 
of  Zarahemla,  who  was  a  descen-
dant of b Mulek, and those who came  
with him into the wilderness.

3 And there were not so many of 
the people of Nephi and of the peo-
ple of Zarahemla as there were of 
the Lamanites; yea, they were not 
half so numerous.

4 And now all the people of Nephi 
were assembled together, and also 
all  the  people  of  Zarahemla,  and 
they  were  gathered  together  in 
two bodies.

5 And it came to pass that Mosiah 
did read, and caused to be read, the 
records of Zeniff to his people; yea, 
he read the records of the people 
of Zeniff, from the time they a left 
the  land  of  Zarahemla  until  they 
b returned again.
