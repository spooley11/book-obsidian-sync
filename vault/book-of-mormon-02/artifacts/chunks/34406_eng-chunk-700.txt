and ninth year; yea, and also there 
was continual peace and great joy 
in the fiftieth year of the reign of 
the judges.

33 And in the fifty and first year 
of  the  reign  of  the  judges  there 
was  peace  also,  save  it  were  the 
pride which began to enter into the 
church—not into the church of God, 
but  into  the  hearts  of  the  people  
who  a professed  to  belong  to  the  
church of God—

34 And  they  were  lifted  up  in 
a pride, even to the persecution of 
many of their brethren. Now this 
was  a  great  evil,  which  did  cause 
the more humble part of the people 
to suffer great persecutions, and to 
wade through much affliction.

35 Nevertheless they did a fast and 
b pray oft, and did wax stronger and 
stronger  in  their  c humility,  and 
firmer  and  firmer  in  the  faith  of 
Christ, unto the filling their souls 
with joy and consolation, yea, even 
to the d purifying and the e sanctifi-
cation of their hearts, which sanc-
tification cometh because of their 
f yielding their hearts unto God.

36 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
fifty and second year ended in peace 
also, save it were the exceedingly 
great pride which had gotten into 
the hearts of the people; and it was 
because of their exceedingly great 
a riches and their prosperity in the 
land;  and  it  did  grow  upon  them 
from day to day.

37 And it came to pass in the fifty 
and third year of the reign of the 
judges, a Helaman died, and his el-
dest son b Nephi began to reign in 
his stead. And it came to pass that 
he did fill the judgment-seat with 
justice and equity; yea, he did keep
