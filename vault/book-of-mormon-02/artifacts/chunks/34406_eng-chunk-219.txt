Nephites  and  they  shall  c write  it; 
and  I  shall  also  speak  unto  the 
other tribes of the house of Israel, 
which  I  have  led  away,  and  they 
shall write it; and I shall also speak 
unto  d all nations of the earth and 
they shall write it.

13 And it shall come to pass that 
the  a Jews shall have the words of 
the Nephites, and the Nephites shall 
have the words of the Jews; and the 
Nephites  and  the  Jews  shall  have 
the words of the  b lost tribes of Is-
rael;  and  the  lost  tribes  of  Israel 
shall have the words of the Neph-
ites and the Jews.

14 And it shall come to pass that my 
people, which are of the a house of 
Israel, shall be gathered home unto 
the b lands of their possessions; and 
my word also shall be gathered in 
c one. And I will show unto them that 
fight against my word and against 
my d people, who are of the e house  
of Israel, that I am God, and that I  
f covenanted  with  g Abraham  that  
I would remember his h seed i forever.

CHAPTER 30
Converted  Gentiles  will  be  numbered 
with  the  covenant  people—Many  La-
manites and Jews will believe the word 
and  become  delightsome—Israel  will 
be restored and the wicked destroyed. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now behold, my beloved breth-
ren,  I  would  speak  unto  you;  for 
I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye

should  suppose  that  ye  are  more 
righteous  than  the  Gentiles  shall 
be. For behold, except ye shall keep 
the commandments of God ye shall 
all likewise a perish; and because of 
the words which have been spoken 
ye need not suppose that the Gen-
tiles are utterly destroyed.

2 For behold, I say unto you that 
as many of the Gentiles as will re-
pent  are  the  a covenant  people  of 
the Lord; and as many of the b Jews 
as will not repent shall be c cast off; 
for the Lord d covenanteth with none 
save  it  be  with  them  that  e repent 
and believe in his Son, who is the 
Holy One of Israel.
