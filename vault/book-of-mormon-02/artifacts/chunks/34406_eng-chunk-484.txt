23 And  the  king  answered  him, 
and  said:  Yea,  I  a will  believe  all 
thy words. And thus he was caught 
with b guile.

24 And  Ammon  began  to  speak 
unto  him  with  a boldness,  and 
said unto him: Believest thou that  
there is a God?

25 And  he  answered,  and  said 
unto him: I do not know what that 
meaneth.

26 And then Ammon said: Believest

thou that there is a a Great Spirit?

27 And he said, Yea.
28 And Ammon said: This is God.

And Ammon said unto him again: 
Believest thou that this Great Spirit, 
who is God, created all things which 
are in heaven and in the earth?

29 And he said: Yea, I believe that 
he created all things which are in 
the  earth;  but  I  do  not  know  the 
heavens.

30 And  Ammon  said  unto  him: 
The heavens is a place where God 
dwells and all his holy angels.

31 And  king  Lamoni  said:  Is  it

above the earth?

32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he 
looketh  down  upon  all  the  chil-
dren of men; and he a knows all the 
thoughts and b intents of the heart; 
for by his hand were they all cre-
ated from the beginning.

33 And king Lamoni said: I believe 
all  these  things  which  thou  hast 
spoken. Art thou a sent from God?

34 Ammon said unto him: I am a 
a man; and man in the beginning was 
created after the image of God, and I 
am called by his b Holy Spirit to teach 
these things unto this people, that 
they may be brought to a knowledge  
of that which is just and true;

35 And  a  portion  of  that  a Spirit 
dwelleth  in  me,  which  giveth  me 
b knowledge, and also power accord-
ing to my faith and desires which 
are in God.

36 Now  when  Ammon  had  said 
these  words,  he  began  at  the  cre-
ation  of  the  world,  and  also  the 
creation of Adam, and told him all 
the  things  concerning  the  fall  of 
man, and  a rehearsed and laid be-
fore him the b records and the holy 
scriptures of the people, which had 
been spoken by the c prophets, even 
down to the time that their father, 
Lehi, left Jerusalem.

37 And  he  also  rehearsed  unto

18 a  tg Discernment, 
Spiritual.
