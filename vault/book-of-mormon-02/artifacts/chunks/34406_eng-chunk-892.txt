15 And it came to pass that there 
were ten more who did fall by the 
sword, with their ten thousand each; 
yea, even a all my people, save it were 
those  twenty  and  four  who  were 
with me, and also a b few who had 
escaped  into  the  south  countries, 
and a few who had deserted over 
unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and 
their  flesh,  and  bones,  and  blood 
lay upon the face of the earth, being 
left by the hands of those who slew 
them to molder upon the land, and 
to crumble and to return to their 
mother earth.

16 And my soul was rent with a an-
guish,  because  of  the  slain  of  my 
people, and I cried:

17 a O ye fair ones, how could ye 
have departed from the ways of the 
Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye 
have rejected that Jesus, who stood 
with open arms to receive you!

18 Behold, if ye had not done this, 
ye would not have fallen. But behold,  
ye are fallen, and I a mourn your loss.
19 O ye a fair sons and daughters, 
ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands 
and  wives,  ye  fair  ones,  how  is  it 
that ye could have b fallen!

20 But behold, ye are gone, and my 
sorrows cannot bring your return.
21 And the day soon cometh that 
your  mortal  must  put  on  immor-
tality, and these bodies which are 
now moldering in corruption must 
soon become a incorruptible bodies;  
and  then  ye  must  stand  before 
the judgment-seat of Christ, to be 
judged  according  to  your  works; 
and if it so be that ye are righteous, 
then are ye blessed with your fathers 
who have gone before you.

22 O that ye had repented before 
this  great  a destruction  had  come 
upon you. But behold, ye are gone,
