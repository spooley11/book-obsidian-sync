9 And I do this that I may prove 
unto many that I am the a same yes-
terday, today, and forever; and that 
I speak forth my b words according 
to  mine  own  pleasure.  And  be-
cause that I have spoken one c word 
ye need not suppose that I cannot 
speak another; for my d work is not 
yet finished; neither shall it be until 
the end of man, neither from that 
time henceforth and forever.

10 Wherefore, because that ye have 
a  Bible  ye  need  not  suppose  that 
it contains all my  a words; neither 
b need  ye  suppose  that  I  have  not 
caused more to be written.

11 For I command a all men, both 
in the east and in the west, and in  
the  north,  and  in  the  south,  and  
in the islands of the sea, that they 
shall b write the words which I speak 
unto  them;  for  out  of  the  c books 
which shall be written I will d judge 
the world, every man according to 
their works, according to that which 
is written.

12 For behold, I shall speak unto 
the  a Jews  and  they  shall  b write 
it; and I shall also speak unto the
