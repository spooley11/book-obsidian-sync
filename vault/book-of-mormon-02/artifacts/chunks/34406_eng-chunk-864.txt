And  now  behold,  I  say  unto  you 
that when the Lord shall see fit, in 
his wisdom, that these sayings shall 
a come unto the Gentiles according 
to his word, then ye may know that 
the  b covenant  which  the  Father 
hath made with the children of Is-
rael,  concerning  their  restoration 
to the  c lands of their inheritance, 
is already beginning to be fulfilled.
2 And ye may know that the words 
of the Lord, which have been spo-
ken by the holy prophets, shall all 
be  fulfilled;  and  ye  need  not  say 
that  the  Lord  a delays  his  coming 
unto the children of Israel.

3 And  ye  need  not  imagine  in 
your hearts that the words which 
have been spoken are vain, for be-
hold, the Lord will remember his 
covenant which he hath made unto 
his people of the house of Israel.

4 And when ye shall see these say-
ings coming forth among you, then 
ye need not any longer spurn at the 
doings of the Lord, for the a sword 
of his b justice is in his right hand;
