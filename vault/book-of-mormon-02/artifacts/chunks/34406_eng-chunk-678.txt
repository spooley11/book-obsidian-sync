8 They have a got possession of the 
land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they 
have appointed a b king over them, 
and he hath written unto the king 
of the Lamanites, in the which he 
hath joined an alliance with him; in 
the which alliance he hath agreed 
to maintain the city of Zarahemla, 
which maintenance he supposeth 
will enable the Lamanites to con-
quer  the  remainder  of  the  land, 
and  he  shall  be  placed  king  over 
this people when they shall be con-
quered c under the Lamanites.

9 And  now,  in  your  epistle  you 
have a censured me, but it mattereth 
not; I am not angry, but do rejoice 
in  the  greatness  of  your  heart.  I, 
Pahoran,  do  not  b seek  for  power, 
save only to retain my judgment-
seat that I may preserve the rights 
and the liberty of my people. My 
soul standeth fast in that liberty in 
the which God hath made us c free.
10 And now, behold, we will resist 
wickedness  even  unto  bloodshed. 
We  would  a not  shed  the  blood  of 
the  Lamanites  if  they  would  stay 
in their own land.

11 We would not shed the blood 
of our brethren if they would not 
rise  up  in  rebellion  and  take  the 
sword against us.

12 We  would  subject  ourselves 
to the a yoke of bondage if it were 
requisite with the justice of God, or 
if he should command us so to do.
13 But  behold  he  doth  not  com-
mand us that we shall subject our-
selves to our enemies, but that we 
should put our  a trust in him, and 
he will deliver us.

14 Therefore, my beloved brother, 
Moroni, let us resist evil, and what-
soever  evil  we  cannot  resist  with 
our a words, yea, such as rebellions

and dissensions, let us b resist them 
with our swords, that we may retain 
our freedom, that we may rejoice in 
the great privilege of our church, 
and in the cause of our Redeemer 
and our God.
