2 Yea, and he did make it known 
unto all his people, in all the land 
round about in that part where he 
was, that they might rejoice also.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
immediately  sent  a an  epistle  to 
b Pahoran, desiring that he should 
cause men to be gathered together 
to  strengthen  Helaman,  or  the 
armies of Helaman, insomuch that  
he  might  with  ease  maintain  
that part of the land which he had 
been so miraculously prospered in  
regaining.

4 And it came to pass when Mo-
roni  had  sent  this  epistle  to  the 
land of Zarahemla, he began again 
to lay a plan that he might obtain 
the remainder of those possessions 
and cities which the Lamanites had 
taken from them.

5 And it came to pass that while 
Moroni was thus making prepara-
tions  to  go  against  the  Lamanites 
to  battle,  behold,  the  people  of 
a Nephihah,  who  were  gathered 
together  from  the  city  of  Moroni 
and  the  city  of  Lehi  and  the  city 
of Morianton, were attacked by the 
Lamanites.

6 Yea,  even  those  who  had  been 
a compelled  to  flee  from  the  land 
of Manti, and from the land round 
about, had come over and joined the 
Lamanites in this part of the land.
7 And thus being exceedingly nu-
merous, yea, and receiving strength 
from day to day, by the command of 
Ammoron they came forth against 
the people of Nephihah, and they 
did begin to slay them with an ex-
ceedingly great slaughter.

8 And  their  armies  were  so  nu-
merous that the remainder of the 
people of  a Nephihah were b obliged 
to flee before them; and they came 
even and joined the army of Moroni.
