of the Lord, shall have other d wit-
ness  besides  him  whom  they  saw 
and heard, that Jesus, whom they 
slew, was the e very Christ and the 
very God.

CHAPTER 4

punish  the  wicked—Greater  wicked-
ness  prevails  than  ever  before  in  all 
Israel—Women and children are sacri-
ficed to idols—The Lamanites begin to
