2 Now,  my  beloved  brethren,  I, 
Jacob, according to the  a responsi-
bility which I am under to God, to 
b magnify mine office with c sober-
ness, and that I might d rid my gar-
ments of your sins, I come up into 
the  temple  this  day  that  I  might 
declare unto you the word of God.
3 And ye yourselves know that I 
have hitherto been diligent in the 
office of my calling; but I this day 
am weighed down with much more 
desire and anxiety for the a welfare  
of your souls than I have hitherto 
been.

4 For behold, as yet, ye have been 
obedient unto the word of the Lord, 
which I have given unto you.

5 But  behold,  hearken  ye  unto 
me, and know that by the help of 
the all-powerful Creator of heaven 
and earth I can tell you concerning 
your a thoughts, how that ye are be-
ginning to labor in sin, which sin 
appeareth  very  abominable  unto 
me, yea, and abominable unto God.
6 Yea,  it  grieveth  my  soul  and 
causeth me to shrink with shame 
before the presence of my Maker, 
that I must testify unto you concern-
ing the wickedness of your hearts.
7 And  also  it  grieveth  me  that 
I  must  use  so  much  a boldness  of 
speech concerning you, before your 
wives and your children, many of 
whose  feelings  are  exceedingly 
tender  and  b chaste  and  delicate
