22 Now  when  they  found  that  
they could not obtain power over 
the Nephites by the pass, they be-
gan  to  dig  down  their  banks  of 
earth that they might obtain a pass 
to  their  armies,  that  they  might 
have an equal chance to fight; but 
behold, in these attempts they were 
swept off by the stones and arrows 
which  were  thrown  at  them;  and 
instead of filling up their ditches 
by pulling down the banks of earth, 
they  were  filled  up  in  a  measure 
with  their  dead  and  wounded  
bodies.

23 Thus the Nephites had all power 
over their enemies; and thus the La-
manites did attempt to destroy the 
Nephites until their a chief captains 
were all slain; yea, and more than 
a thousand of the Lamanites were 
slain;  while,  on  the  other  hand, 
there was not a single soul of the 
Nephites which was slain.

24 There  were  about  fifty  who 
were wounded, who had been ex-

posed to the arrows of the Lamanites  
through  the  pass,  but  they  were 
shielded by their a shields, and their 
breastplates, and their head-plates, 
insomuch that their wounds were 
upon their legs, many of which were  
very severe.

25 And it came to pass, that when 
the Lamanites saw that their chief 
captains  were  all  slain  they  fled 
into the wilderness. And it came to 
pass that they returned to the land  
of  Nephi,  to  inform  their  king, 
Amalickiah, who was a a Nephite by 
birth, concerning their great b loss.
26 And it came to pass that he was 
exceedingly angry with his people, 
because  he  had  not  obtained  his 
desire  over  the  Nephites;  he  had 
not subjected them to the yoke of 
bondage.

27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, 
and he did a curse God, and also Mo-
roni,  swearing  with  an  b oath  that 
he would drink his blood; and this 
because Moroni had kept the com-
mandments  of  God  in  preparing 
for the safety of his people.

28 And it came to pass, that on the 
other hand, the people of Nephi did 
a thank the Lord their God, because 
of his matchless power in deliver-
ing them from the hands of their 
enemies.

29 And thus ended the nineteenth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi.
