28 Behold, O my God, their costly 
apparel, and their ringlets, and their 
a bracelets, and their ornaments of 
gold, and all their precious things 
which they are ornamented with; 
and behold, their hearts are set upon 
them, and yet they cry unto thee 
and say—We thank thee, O God, for 
we are a chosen people unto thee, 
while others shall perish.

29 Yea, and they say that thou hast 
made it known unto them that there 
shall be no Christ.

30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou 
suffer that such wickedness and in-
fidelity shall be among this people? 
O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, 
that I may  a bear with mine infir-
mities. For I am infirm, and such 
wickedness among this people doth 
pain my soul.

31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly 
sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul 
a in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant 
unto me that I may have strength, 
that  I  may  suffer  with  patience 
these b afflictions which shall come 
upon me, because of the iniquity 
of this people.

32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my 
soul, and give unto me success, and 
also my fellow laborers who are with 
me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and 
Omner, and also a Amulek and Zeez-
rom, and also my  b two sons—yea, 
even all these wilt thou comfort, O 
Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their 
souls in Christ.

33 Wilt thou grant unto them that 
they may have strength, that they 
may  a bear their afflictions which 
shall come upon them because of 
the iniquities of this people.

34 O Lord, wilt thou grant a unto us 
that we may have success in bring-
ing them again unto thee in Christ.
35 Behold, O Lord, their a souls are 
precious,  and  many  of  them  are 
our brethren; therefore, give unto 
us, O Lord, power and wisdom that 
we may bring these, our brethren, 
again unto thee.

36 Now it came to pass that when 
Alma  had  said  these  words,  that 
he  a clapped  his  b hands  upon  all 
them who were with him. And be-
hold, as he clapped his hands upon 
them,  they  were  filled  with  the  
Holy Spirit.
