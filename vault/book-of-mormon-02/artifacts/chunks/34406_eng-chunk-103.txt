12 And  then,  O  house  of  Israel, 
behold, a these shall come from far; 
and  lo,  these  from  the  north  and 
from the west; and these from the 
land of Sinim.

13 a Sing,  O  heavens;  and  be  joy-
ful,  O  earth;  for  the  feet  of  those 
who are in the east shall be estab-
lished; and b break forth into sing-
ing, O mountains; for they shall be 
smitten no more; for the Lord hath 
comforted his people, and will have 
mercy upon his c afflicted.

14 But,  behold,  Zion  hath  said: 
The  Lord  hath  forsaken  me,  and 
my Lord hath forgotten me—but he  
will show that he hath not.

15 For  can  a  a woman  forget  her 
sucking child, that she should not 
have  b compassion  on  the  son  of 
her womb? Yea, they may  c forget, 
yet will I not forget thee, O house 
of Israel.

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon 
the a palms of my hands; thy walls 
are continually before me.

17 Thy children shall make haste 
against  thy  destroyers;  and  they 
that  made  thee  a waste  shall  go 
forth of thee.

18 Lift up thine eyes round about 
and behold; all these a gather them-
selves together, and they shall come 
to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, 
thou shalt surely clothe thee with 
them all, as with an ornament, and 
bind them on even as a bride.

19 For thy waste and thy desolate 
places, and the land of thy destruc-
tion, shall even now be too narrow 
by reason of the inhabitants; and

they that swallowed thee up shall 
be far away.

20 The children whom thou shalt 
have, after thou hast lost the first, 
shall a again in thine ears say: The 
place is too strait for me; give place 
to me that I may dwell.

21 Then  shalt  thou  say  in  thine 
heart: Who hath begotten me these, 
seeing I have lost my children, and 
am  a desolate,  a  captive,  and  re-
moving to and fro? And who hath 
brought  up  these?  Behold,  I  was 
left alone; these, where have they  
been?
