people should be engraven upon his  
a other plates, and that I should b pre-
serve these plates and hand them 
down unto my seed, from generation  
to generation.

4 And  if  there  were  preaching 
which  was  a sacred,  or  revelation 
which  was  great,  or  prophesying,  
that I should engraven the b heads of 
them upon these plates, and touch 
upon them as much as it were pos-
sible, for Christ’s sake, and for the 
sake of our people.

5 For  because  of  faith  and  great 
anxiety,  it  truly  had  been  made 
manifest  unto  us  concerning  our 
people,  what  things  should  a hap-
pen unto them.

6 And we also had many revelations, 
and  the  spirit  of  much  prophecy;  
wherefore, we knew of a Christ and 
his kingdom, which should come.

7 Wherefore we labored diligently 
among our people, that we might 
persuade them to a come unto Christ, 
and partake of the goodness of God, 
that they might enter into his b rest, 
lest by any means he should swear 
in his wrath they should not c enter 
in, as in the d provocation in the days 
of temptation while the children of  
Israel were in the e wilderness.
