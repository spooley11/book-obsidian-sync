people that they had been wrought 
upon by the Spirit of God, and had 
been  healed;  and  they  did  show 
forth  signs  also  and  did  do  some 
miracles among the people.

23 Thus  passed  away  the  thirty 
and  second  year  also.  And  Nephi 
did cry unto the people in the com-
mencement of the thirty and third 
year; and he did preach unto them 
repentance and remission of sins.
24 Now  I  would  have  you  to  re-
member also, that there were none 
who were brought unto a repentance 
who were not baptized with water.
25 Therefore, there were ordained 
of Nephi, men unto this ministry, 
that all such as should come unto 
them should be a baptized with wa-
ter, and this as a witness and a tes-
timony  before  God,  and  unto  the 
people, that they had repented and 
received a b remission of their sins.
26 And  there  were  many  in  the 
commencement  of  this  year  that 
were  baptized  unto  repentance; 
and thus the more part of the year 
did pass away.

the crucifixion of Christ—Many people 
are  destroyed—Darkness  covers  the 
land for three days—Those who remain 
bemoan their fate. About a.d. 33–34.
And  now  it  came  to  pass  that  ac-
cording to our record, and we know 
our record to be a true, for behold, 
it  was  a  b just  man  who  did  keep 
the record—for he truly did c many 
d miracles in the e name of Jesus; and

there was not any man who could 
do a miracle in the name of Jesus 
save he were cleansed every whit 
from his iniquity—

2 And  now  it  came  to  pass,  if 
there  was  no  mistake  made  by 
this  man  in  the  reckoning  of  our 
time, the a thirty and third year had  
passed away;
