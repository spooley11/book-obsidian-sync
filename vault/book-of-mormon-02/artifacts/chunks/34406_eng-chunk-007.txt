“After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather 
immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and 
it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around  
him;  when,  instantly  I  saw,  as  it  were,  a  conduit  open  right  up  into 
heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was

midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again 
beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly

sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at 
what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again 
I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or 
repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution 
to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence of 
the indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for 
the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have 
no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must 
not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom; 
otherwise I could not get them.
