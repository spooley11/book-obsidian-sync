9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown 
unto me that they should  a return 
again. And he also has shown unto 
me that the Lord God, the Holy One 
of Israel, should manifest himself 
unto  them  in  the  flesh;  and  after 
he  should  manifest  himself  they 
should  b scourge  him  and  c crucify 
him, according to the words of the 
angel who spake it unto me.

10 And after they have a hardened 
their  hearts  and  b stiffened  their 
necks against the Holy One of Israel, 
behold, the c judgments of the Holy 
One of Israel shall come upon them. 
And the day cometh that they shall 
be smitten and afflicted.

11 Wherefore, after they are driven 
to and fro, for thus saith the angel, 
many shall be afflicted in the flesh, 
and shall not be suffered to  a per-
ish, because of the prayers of the 
faithful; they shall be scattered, and 
smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the 
Lord will be merciful unto them, 
that b when they shall come to the 
c knowledge of their Redeemer, they 
shall  be  d gathered  together  again 
to the e lands of their inheritance.

12 And blessed are the a Gentiles, 
they of whom the prophet has writ-
ten; for behold, if it so be that they 
shall repent and fight not against 
Zion, and do not unite themselves to 
that great and b abominable church, 
they shall be saved; for the Lord God 
will fulfil his c covenants which he 
has made unto his children; and for 
this cause the prophet has written 
these things.

13 Wherefore,  they  that  fight 
against Zion and the covenant peo-
ple  of  the  Lord  shall  lick  up  the 
dust of their feet; and the people 
of the Lord shall not be a ashamed. 
For the people of the Lord are they 
who  b wait  for  him;  for  they  still 
wait for the coming of the Messiah.
