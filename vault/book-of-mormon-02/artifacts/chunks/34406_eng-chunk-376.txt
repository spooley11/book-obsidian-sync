21 Therefore  they  did  a assemble 
themselves  together  in  different 
bodies, being called churches; every 
church having their priests and their 
teachers, and every priest preaching  
the word according as it was deliv-
ered to him by the mouth of Alma.
22 And  thus,  notwithstanding 
there  being  many  churches  they 
were all one a church, yea, even the 
church of God; for there was nothing 
preached in all the churches except 
it were repentance and faith in God.
23 And  now  there  were  seven 
churches in the land of Zarahemla. 
And it came to pass that whosoever 
were desirous to take upon them the 
a name of Christ, or of God, they did 
join the churches of God;

24 And they were called the a people  
of God. And the Lord did pour out 
his b Spirit upon them, and they were 
blessed, and prospered in the land.

CHAPTER 26

Many members of the Church are led 
into sin by unbelievers—Alma is prom-
ised eternal life—Those who repent and 
are baptized gain forgiveness—Church 
members in sin who repent and confess 
to Alma and to the Lord will be forgiven; 
otherwise,  they  will  not  be  numbered 
among the people of the Church. About 
120–100 b.c.
Now it came to pass that there were 
many of the rising generation that 
could not understand the a words of 
king Benjamin, being little children 
at the time he spake unto his peo-
ple; and they did  b not believe the 
tradition of their fathers.

2 They did not believe what had 
been said concerning the resurrec-
tion of the dead, neither did they 
believe concerning the coming of 
Christ.

3 And now because of their  a un-
belief they could not b understand 
the word of God; and their hearts 
were hardened.

4 And they would not be baptized; 
neither would they join the a church. 
And  they  were  a  separate  people 
as to their faith, and remained so 
ever after, even in their b carnal and 
sinful state; for they would not call 
upon the Lord their God.

5 And now in the reign of Mosiah  
they  were  not  half  so  numerous 
as  the  people  of  God;  but  be-
cause  of  the  a dissensions  among 
the  brethren  they  became  more  
numerous.
