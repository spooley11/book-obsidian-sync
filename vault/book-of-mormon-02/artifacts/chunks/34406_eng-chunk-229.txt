Nephi’s  words  are  true—They  testify 
of Christ—Those who believe in Christ 
will believe Nephi’s words, which will 
stand as a witness before the judgment 
bar. About 559–545 b.c.
And now I, Nephi, cannot write all 
the things which were taught among 
my  people;  neither  am  I  a mighty 
in  writing,  like  unto  speaking; 
for when a man  b speaketh by the 
power of the Holy Ghost the power 
of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto 
the hearts of the children of men.
2 But  behold,  there  are  many 
that  a harden their  b hearts against 
the  c Holy  Spirit,  that  it  hath  no 
place in them; wherefore, they cast 
many things away which are writ-
ten and esteem them as things of  
naught.

3 But I, Nephi, have written what 
I have written, and I esteem it as of 
great  a worth,  and  especially  unto 
my people. For I b pray continually 
for  them  by  day,  and  mine  c eyes 
water my pillow by night, because 
of them; and I cry unto my God in 
faith, and I know that he will hear 
my cry.

4 And I know that the Lord God 
will consecrate my prayers for the

gain of my people. And the words 
which I have written in weakness 
will be made strong unto them; for 
it a persuadeth them to do good; it 
maketh known unto them of their 
fathers;  and  it  speaketh  of  Jesus, 
and  persuadeth  them  to  believe 
in him, and to endure to the end, 
which is life b eternal.

5 And it speaketh a harshly against 
sin, according to the b plainness of 
the truth; wherefore, no man will 
be angry at the words which I have 
written save he shall be of the spirit 
of the devil.

6 I a glory in b plainness; I glory in 
truth;  I  glory  in  my  Jesus,  for  he 
hath c redeemed my soul from hell.
7 I  have  a charity  for  my  people, 
and  great  faith  in  Christ  that  I 
shall meet many souls spotless at 
his judgment-seat.

8 I  have  charity  for  the  a Jew—I 
say Jew, because I mean them from 
whence I came.
