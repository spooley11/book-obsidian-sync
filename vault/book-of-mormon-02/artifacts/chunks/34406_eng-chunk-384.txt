19 And now the astonishment of 
Alma was so great that he became 
a dumb, that he could not open his 
mouth; yea, and he became weak, 
even  that  he  could  not  move  his 
hands; therefore he was taken by 
those that were with him, and car-
ried helpless, even until he was laid 
before his father.

20 And  they  rehearsed  unto  his 
father all that had happened unto 
them; and his father rejoiced, for 
he  knew  that  it  was  the  power  
of God.

21 And he caused that a multitude 
should  be  gathered  together  that 
they might witness what the Lord

that his limbs might receive their 
strength—that the eyes of the people 
might be opened to see and know

strength, and he stood up and be-

my sins, and have been a redeemed 
of  the  Lord;  behold  I  am  born  of 
the Spirit.
