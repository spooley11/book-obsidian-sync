commandeth you that ye suffer no 
ravenous wolf to enter among you, 
that ye may not be destroyed.

you  in  the  language  of  a him  who 
hath  commanded  me,  that  ye  ob-
serve to do the words which I have 
spoken unto you.

62 I  speak  by  way  of  command 
unto you that belong to the church;

to  the  church  I  speak  by  way  of 
invitation,  saying:  Come  and  be 
baptized unto repentance, that ye 
also may be partakers of the fruit 
of the a tree of life.
