31 And thus they did a prosper and 
become far more wealthy than those 
who did not belong to their church.
32 For those who did not belong  
to their church did indulge them-
selves in a sorceries, and in b idolatry 
or c idleness, and in d babblings, and 
in  e envyings  and  f strife;  wearing 
costly apparel; being g lifted up in  
the  pride  of  their  own  eyes;  per-
secuting, lying, thieving, robbing, 
committing whoredoms, and mur-
dering, and all manner of wicked-
ness; nevertheless, the law was put in  
force upon all those who did trans-
gress it, inasmuch as it was possible.
33 And  it  came  to  pass  that  by  
thus exercising the law upon them, 
every  man  suffering  according  to 
that which he had done, they became 
more  still,  and  durst  not  commit 
any  wickedness  if  it  were  known; 
therefore,  there  was  much  peace 
among the people of Nephi until the  
fifth year of the reign of the judges.

Amlici, that he was not made king
