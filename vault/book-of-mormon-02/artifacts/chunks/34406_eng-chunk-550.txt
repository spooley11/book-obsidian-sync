40 And thus, if ye will not nourish 
the word, looking forward with an 
eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye 
can never pluck of the fruit of the 
a tree of life.

41 But if ye will nourish the word, 
yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth 
to  grow,  by  your  faith  with  great 
diligence, and with a patience, look-
ing forward to the fruit thereof, it 
shall take root; and behold it shall 
be a tree b springing up unto ever-
lasting life.

42 And because of your a diligence 
and your faith and your patience 
with the word in nourishing it, that 
it may take root in you, behold, by  
and  by  ye  shall  pluck  the  b fruit 
thereof,  which  is  most  precious, 
which  is  sweet  above  all  that  is 
sweet, and which is white above all 
that is white, yea, and pure above 
all that is pure; and ye shall feast 
upon  this  fruit  even  until  ye  are 
filled, that ye hunger not, neither 
shall ye thirst.

43 Then,  my  brethren,  ye  shall 
a reap  the  b rewards  of  your  faith, 
and your diligence, and patience, 
and long-suffering, waiting for the 
tree to bring forth c fruit unto you.

CHAPTER 33
Zenos taught that men should pray and 
worship in all places, and that judgments 
are turned away because of the Son—
Zenock taught that mercy is bestowed 
because of the Son—Moses had lifted 
up in the wilderness a type of the Son 
of God. About 74 b.c.
Now after Alma had spoken these 
words, they sent forth unto him de-
siring to know whether they should 
believe in a one God, that they might

obtain this fruit of which he had 
spoken, or b how they should plant 
the c seed, or the word of which he 
had spoken, which he said must be 
planted in their hearts; or in what 
manner they should begin to exer-
cise their faith.

2 And Alma said unto them: Be-
hold,  ye  have  said  that  ye  a could 
not b worship your God because ye 
are cast out of your synagogues. But 
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose  
that ye cannot worship God, ye do 
greatly err, and ye ought to search 
the  c scriptures; if ye suppose that 
they have taught you this, ye do not 
understand them.
