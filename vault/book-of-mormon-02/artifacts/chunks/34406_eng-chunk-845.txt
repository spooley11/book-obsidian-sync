15 Behold, they shall surely gather 
together a against thee, not by me; 
whosoever  shall  gather  together 
against thee shall fall for thy sake.
16 Behold, I have created the smith 
that bloweth the coals in the fire, 
and that bringeth forth an instru-
ment for his work; and I have created  
the waster to destroy.

17 No  weapon  that  is  formed 
against thee shall prosper; and every 
tongue that shall revile against thee 
in judgment thou shalt condemn. 
This is the heritage of the a servants 
of the Lord, and their righteousness 
is of me, saith the Lord.

CHAPTER 23
Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—
He commands the people to search the 
prophets—The words of Samuel the La-
manite concerning the Resurrection are 
added to their records. About a.d. 34.
And  now,  behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
that ye ought to a search these things. 
Yea,  a  commandment  I  give  unto 
you that ye search these things dili-
gently; for great are the words of  
b Isaiah.

a therefore it must needs be that he  
must speak also to the Gentiles.

3 And all things that he spake have 
been and a shall be, even according 
to the words which he spake.

4 Therefore give heed to my words; 
write the things which I have told 
you; and according to the time and 
the will of the Father a they shall go 
forth unto the Gentiles.
