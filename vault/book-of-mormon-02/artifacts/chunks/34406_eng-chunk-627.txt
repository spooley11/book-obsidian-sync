6 Thus Moroni did prepare strong-
holds against the coming of their 
enemies, round about every city in 
all the land.

7 And it came to pass that Moroni 
caused  that  his  armies  should  go

forth into the east wilderness; yea, 
and they went forth and drove all 
the Lamanites who were in the east 
wilderness  into  their  own  lands, 
which  were  a south  of  the  land  of 
Zarahemla.

8 And the land of a Nephi did run 
in a straight course from the east 
sea to the west.

9 And it came to pass that when 
Moroni had driven all the Laman-
ites  out  of  the  east  wilderness, 
which  was  north  of  the  lands  of 
their  own  possessions,  he  caused 
that  the  inhabitants  who  were  in 
the land of Zarahemla and in the 
land round about should go forth 
into the east wilderness, even to the 
borders by the seashore, and possess  
the land.

10 And he also placed armies on 
the  south,  in  the  borders  of  their 
possessions,  and  caused  them  to 
erect a fortifications that they might 
secure their armies and their people 
from the hands of their enemies.

11 And  thus  he  cut  off  all  the 
strongholds  of  the  Lamanites  in  
the east wilderness, yea, and also 
on  the  west,  fortifying  the  line 
between the Nephites and the La-
manites, between the land of Zara-
hemla and the land of Nephi, from 
the west sea, running by the head 
of  the  a river  Sidon—the  Nephites 
possessing all the land b northward, 
yea,  even  all  the  land  which  was 
northward  of  the  land  Bountiful, 
according to their pleasure.

12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, 
which did increase daily because of 
the assurance of protection which 
his works did bring forth unto them, 
did seek to cut off the strength and 
the power of the Lamanites from off 
the lands of their possessions, that 
they  should  have  no  power  upon 
the lands of their possession.

13 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites began the foundation of a
