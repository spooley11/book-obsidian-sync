CHAPTER 16
The  Lamanites  destroy  the  people  of 
Ammonihah—Zoram leads the Nephites 
to victory over the Lamanites—Alma 
and Amulek and many others preach 
the  word—They  teach  that  after  His 
Resurrection Christ will appear to the 
Nephites. About 81–77 b.c.
And it came to pass in the eleventh 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, on the fifth day 
of the second month, there having 
been  much  peace  in  the  land  of 
Zarahemla,  there  having  been  no 
wars nor contentions for a certain 
number  of  years,  even  until  the 
fifth  day  of  the  second  month  in 
the eleventh year, there was a cry 
of war heard throughout the land.
2 For  behold,  the  armies  of  the 
Lamanites  had  come  in  upon  the 
wilderness  side,  into  the  borders 
of  the  land,  even  into  the  city  of 
a Ammonihah, and began to slay the 
people and destroy the city.

3 And now it came to pass, before 
the Nephites could raise a sufficient 
army to drive them out of the land, 
they had a destroyed the people who 
were  in  the  city  of  Ammonihah, 
and also some around the borders 
of Noah, and taken others captive 
into the wilderness.

4 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites  were  desirous  to  obtain 
those who had been carried away 
captive into the wilderness.

5 Therefore,  he  that  had  been 
appointed  chief  captain  over  the 
armies  of  the  Nephites,  (and  his 
name was Zoram, and he had two 
sons,  Lehi  and  Aha)—now  Zoram 
and his two sons, knowing that Alma 
was  high  priest  over  the  church, 
and having heard that he had the 
spirit of prophecy, therefore they 
went unto him and desired of him 
to  know  whither  the  Lord  would 
that  they  should  go  into  the  wil-
derness in search of their brethren, 
who had been taken captive by the  
Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Alma 
a inquired  of  the  Lord  concerning 
the  matter.  And  Alma  returned 
and  said  unto  them:  Behold,  the 
Lamanites will cross the river Sidon 
in  the  south  wilderness,  away  up 
beyond the borders of the land of 
b Manti. And behold there shall ye 
meet them, on the east of the river 
Sidon, and there the Lord will de-
liver unto thee thy brethren who 
have  been  taken  captive  by  the 
Lamanites.
