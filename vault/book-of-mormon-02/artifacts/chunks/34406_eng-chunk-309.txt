3 And again, it came to pass that 
when king Benjamin had made an 
end  of  all  these  things,  and  had 
consecrated his son a Mosiah to be 
a ruler and a king over his people, 
and had given him all the charges 
concerning the kingdom, and also 
had  b appointed  c priests  to  d teach 
the people, that thereby they might 
hear and know the commandments 
of God, and to stir them up in re-
membrance of the e oath which they 
had made, he dismissed the multi-
tude, and they returned, every one, 
according to their f families, to their 
own houses.

4 And  Mosiah  began  to  reign  in 
his father’s stead. And he began to 
reign  in  the  thirtieth  year  of  his 
age,  making  in  the  whole,  about 
four  hundred  and  seventy-six

years from the a time that Lehi left  
Jerusalem.

5 And king Benjamin lived three

years and he died.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
Mosiah did a walk in the ways of the 
Lord, and did observe his judgments 
and his statutes, and did keep his 
commandments in all things what-
soever he commanded him.

7 And king Mosiah did cause his 
people  that  they  should  till  the 
earth. And he also, himself, did till 
the earth, that thereby he might a not 
become burdensome to his people, 
that he might do according to that 
which  his  father  had  done  in  all 
things. And there was no conten-
tion  among  all  his  people  for  the 
space of three years.

CHAPTER 7
Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi, 
where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are 
in bondage to the Lamanites—Limhi 
recounts their history—A prophet (Abin-
adi) had testified that Christ is the God 
and Father of all things—Those who 
sow filthiness reap the whirlwind, and 
those who put their trust in the Lord 
will be delivered. About 121 b.c.
And now, it came to pass that af-
ter king Mosiah had had continual 
peace for the space of three years, 
he was desirous to know concerning 
the people who a went up to dwell 
in  the  land  of  b Lehi-Nephi,  or  in 
the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his peo-
ple had heard nothing from them 
from the time they left the land of 
c Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied 
him with their teasings.
