weapons of war, and would that I 
should be their leader; and we have 
come forth to defend our country.
6 And  now  ye  also  know  con-
cerning the a covenant which their 
fathers made, that they would not 
take up their weapons of war against 
their brethren to shed blood.

7 But in the twenty and sixth year, 
when they saw our afflictions and 
our tribulations for them, they were 
about to a break the covenant which 
they had made and take up their 
weapons of war in our defence.

8 But I would not suffer them that 
they  should  break  this  a covenant 
which  they  had  made,  supposing 
that God would strengthen us, in-
somuch that we should not suffer 
more because of the fulfilling the 
b oath which they had taken.

9 But behold, here is one thing in 
which we may have great joy. For 
behold,  in  the  twenty  and  sixth 
year, I, Helaman, did march at the 
head of these a two thousand young 
men to the city of b Judea, to assist 
Antipus, whom ye had appointed a 
leader over the people of that part 
of the land.

10 And  I  did  join  my  two  thou-
sand a sons, (for they are worthy to 
be called sons) to the army of An-
tipus,  in  which  strength  Antipus 
did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, 
his army had been reduced by the 
Lamanites because their forces had 
slain  a  vast  number  of  our  men, 
for which cause we have to mourn.
11 Nevertheless, we may console 
ourselves  in  this  point,  that  they 
have  died  in  the  cause  of  their 
country and of their God, yea, and 
they are a happy.

12 And the Lamanites had also re-
tained many prisoners, all of whom 
are chief a captains, for none other 
have  they  spared  alive.  And  we 
suppose that they are now at this
