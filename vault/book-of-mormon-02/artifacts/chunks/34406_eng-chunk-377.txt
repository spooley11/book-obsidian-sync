MOSIAH 26  : 7–23

that those who committed sin, that 
were in the church, should be c ad-
monished by the church.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
were brought before the priests, and 
delivered  up  unto  the  a priests  by  
the teachers; and the priests brought 
them  before  Alma,  who  was  the 
b high priest.

8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma

the a authority over the b church.

9 And it came to pass that Alma 
did  not  know  concerning  them; 
but  there  were  many  a witnesses 
against them; yea, the people stood 
and  testified  of  their  iniquity  in  
abundance.

10 Now  there  had  not  any  such 
thing  happened  before  in  the 
church;  therefore  Alma  was  trou-
bled in his spirit, and he caused that 
they should be brought before the  
king.

11 And  he  said  unto  the  king: 
Behold,  here  are  many  whom  we 
have brought before thee, who are 
accused of their brethren; yea, and 
they have been taken in divers in-
iquities. And they do not repent of 
their iniquities; therefore we have 
brought them before thee, that thou 
mayest  judge  them  according  to 
their crimes.

12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma: 
Behold, I judge them not; therefore 
I  a deliver  them  into  thy  hands  to 
be judged.

13 And now the spirit of Alma was 
again troubled; and he went and in-
quired of the Lord what he should 
do  concerning  this  matter,  for  he 
feared that he should do wrong in 
the sight of God.
