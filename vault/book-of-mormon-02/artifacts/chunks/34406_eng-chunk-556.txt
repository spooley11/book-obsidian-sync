14 And  behold,  this  is  the  whole 
a meaning  of  the  b law,  every  whit 
c pointing to that great and last d sacri-
fice; and that great and last e sacrifice 
will be the Son of God, yea, f  infinite  
and eternal.

15 And  thus  he  shall  bring  a sal-
vation  to  all  those  who  shall  be-
lieve  on  his  name;  this  being  the 
intent of this last sacrifice, to bring 
about the bowels of mercy, which 
overpowereth justice, and bringeth 
about  means  unto  men  that  they 
may have faith unto repentance.

16 And  thus  a mercy  can  satisfy  
the  demands  of  b justice,  and  en-
circles them in the arms of safety, 
while  he  that  exercises  no  faith 
unto repentance is exposed to the

whole law of the demands of c jus-
tice; therefore only unto him that 
has faith unto repentance is brought 
about the great and eternal d plan of  
e redemption.

17 Therefore may God grant unto 
you, my brethren, that ye may begin 
to exercise your a faith unto repen-
tance, that ye begin to  b call upon 
his holy name, that he would have 
mercy upon you;

18 Yea,  cry  unto  him  for  mercy;

for he is a mighty to save.

19 Yea,  humble  yourselves,  and

continue in a prayer unto him.

20 Cry unto him when ye are in 
your a fields, yea, over all your flocks.
21 a Cry unto him in your houses, 
yea, over all your household, both 
morning, mid-day, and evening.

22 Yea, cry unto him against the

power of your a enemies.

23 Yea, a cry unto him against the 
b devil, who is an enemy to all c righ-
teousness.

24 Cry  unto  him  over  the  crops 
of your fields, that ye may prosper 
in them.

25 Cry  over  the  flocks  of  your

fields, that they may increase.

26 But  this  is  not  all;  ye  must 
a pour out your souls in your b clos-
ets, and your secret places, and in 
your wilderness.

27 Yea, and when you do not cry 
unto the Lord, let your a hearts be 
b full, drawn out in prayer unto him 
continually for your c welfare, and 
also for the welfare of d those who 
are around you.
