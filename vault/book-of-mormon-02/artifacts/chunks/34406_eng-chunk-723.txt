4 And  those  judges  were  angry 
with him because he a spake plainly 
unto them concerning their secret 
works  of  darkness;  nevertheless, 
they durst not lay their own hands 
upon him, for they feared the peo-
ple lest they should cry out against 
them.

5 Therefore they did cry unto the 
people, saying: Why do you suffer 
this man to revile against us? For

HELAMAN 8  : 6–18

behold  he  doth  condemn  all  this 
people, even unto destruction; yea, 
and also that these our  a great cit-
ies shall be taken from us, that we 
shall have no place in them.

6 And  now  we  know  that  this  is 
impossible, for behold, we are a pow-
erful, and our cities great, therefore 
our  enemies  can  have  no  power  
over us.

7 And  it  came  to  pass  that  thus 
they did a stir up the people to anger 
against Nephi, and raised conten-
tions among them; for there were 
some who did cry out: b Let this man 
alone,  for  he  is  a  good  man,  and  
those  things  which  he  saith  will 
surely come to pass except we repent;
8 Yea, behold, all the judgments 
will  come  upon  us  which  he  has 
testified unto us; for we know that 
he has testified aright unto us con-
cerning our iniquities. And behold 
they are many, and he a knoweth as 
well  all  things  which  shall  befall 
us as he knoweth of our iniquities;
9 Yea, and behold, if he had not 
been a prophet he could not have 
a testified concerning those things.
10 And it came to pass that those 
people who sought to destroy Nephi 
were compelled because of their fear, 
that  they  did  not  lay  their  hands 
on him; therefore he began again  
to  speak  unto  them,  seeing  that 
he had gained favor in the eyes of 
some, insomuch that the remainder 
of them did fear.
