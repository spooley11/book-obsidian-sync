9 And now, behold, I say no more 
concerning them, for there are none 
save it be the Lamanites and a rob-
bers that do exist upon the face of 
the land.

10 And  there  are  none  that  do 
know  the  true  God  save  it  be  the 
a disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in 
the land until the wickedness of the 
people was so great that the Lord 
would not suffer them to  b remain 
with the people; and whether they 
be upon the face of the land no man  
knoweth.

11 But  behold,  my  a father  and  I 
have  seen  b them,  and  they  have 
ministered unto us.

12 And whoso receiveth a this record,  
and shall not condemn it because of 
the imperfections which are in it, the 
same shall know of b greater things 
than  these.  Behold,  I  am  Moroni;  
and were it possible, I would make 
all things known unto you.

13 Behold, I make an end of speak-
ing concerning this people. I am the 
son of Mormon, and my father was 
a a descendant of Nephi.

14 And I am the same who  a hid-
eth up this record unto the Lord; 
the plates thereof are of no worth, 
because  of  the  commandment  of 
the Lord. For he truly saith that no 
one  shall  have  them  b to  get  gain; 
but the record thereof is of c great 
worth; and whoso shall bring it to 
light, him will the Lord bless.
