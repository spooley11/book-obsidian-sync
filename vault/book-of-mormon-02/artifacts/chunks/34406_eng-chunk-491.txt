33 And it came to pass that when 
Ammon arose he also administered 
unto them, and also did all the ser-
vants of Lamoni; and they did all 
declare unto the people the selfsame 
thing—that their hearts had been 
a changed;  that  they  had  no  more 
desire to do b evil.

34 And behold, many did declare 
unto the people that they had seen 
a angels and had conversed with them; 
and thus they had told them things 
of God, and of his righteousness.

35 And it came to pass that there 
were many that did a believe in their 
words; and as many as did believe 
were baptized; and they became a 
righteous people, and they did es-
tablish a church among them.

36 And thus the work of the Lord 
did commence among the Laman-
ites; thus the Lord did begin to pour 
out his a Spirit upon them; and we 
see that his arm is extended to b all 
people who will repent and believe 
on his name.

CHAPTER 20
The Lord sends Ammon to Middoni to 
deliver his imprisoned brethren—Am-
mon and Lamoni meet Lamoni’s father, 
who is king over all the land—Ammon 
compels  the  old  king  to  approve  the 
release of his brethren. About 90 b.c.

And it came to pass that when they 
had  established  a  church  in  that 
a land, that king Lamoni desired that 
Ammon should go with him to the 
land of Nephi, that he might show 
him unto his father.

2 And the voice of the Lord came 
to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go 
up to the land of Nephi, for behold, 
the king will seek thy life; but thou 
shalt go to the land of a Middoni; for 
behold, thy brother Aaron, and also 
Muloki and Ammah are in prison.
3 Now it came to pass that when 
Ammon had heard this, he said unto 
Lamoni:  Behold,  my  brother  and 
brethren are in prison at Middoni, 
and I go that I may deliver them.
