Christ, (among whom were the a three 
disciples of Jesus who should tarry)  
were called Nephites, and Jacobites, 
and Josephites, and Zoramites.

38 And it came to pass that they 
who rejected the gospel were called 
Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ish-
maelites; and they did not dwindle 
in a unbelief, but they did b wilfully 
rebel against the gospel of Christ; 
and they did teach their children 
that they should not believe, even 
as their fathers, from the beginning, 
did dwindle.

39 And  it  was  because  of  the 
wickedness  and  abomination  of 
their fathers, even as it was in the 
beginning. And they were a taught 
to hate the children of God, even 
as  the  Lamanites  were  taught  to 
b hate  the  children  of  Nephi  from 
the beginning.

40 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and forty and four years 
had passed away, and thus were the 
affairs of the people. And the a more 
wicked part of the people did wax 
strong,  and  became  exceedingly 
more numerous than were the peo-
ple of God.

41 And they did still continue to 
build up churches unto themselves, 
and  adorn  them  with  all  manner 
of  precious  things.  And  thus  did 
two  hundred  and  fifty  years  pass 
away,  and  also  two  hundred  and 
sixty years.
