4 And it came to pass that Jared 
was anointed king over the people, 
by the hand of wickedness; and he  
gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.
5 And it came to pass that Akish 
a sought the life of his father-in-law; 
and  he  applied  unto  those  whom 
he had sworn by the  b oath of the 
ancients,  and  they  obtained  the 
head of his father-in-law, as he sat 
upon  his  throne,  giving  audience 
to his people.

6 For so great had been the spread-
ing of this wicked and secret society 
that it had corrupted the hearts of 
all the people; therefore Jared was 
murdered  upon  his  throne,  and 
Akish reigned in his stead.

ETHER 9  : 7–23

7 And it came to pass that Akish 
began  to  be  a jealous  of  his  son, 
therefore he shut him up in prison, 
and kept him upon little or no food 
until he had suffered death.

8 And now the brother of him that 
suffered death, (and his name was 
Nimrah) was angry with his father 
because  of  that  which  his  father 
had done unto his brother.

9 And it came to pass that Nimrah 
gathered together a small number of 
men, and fled out of the land, and 
came over and dwelt with Omer.

10 And it came to pass that Akish 
begat other sons, and they won the 
hearts of the people, notwithstand-
ing they had sworn unto him to do 
all manner of iniquity according to 
that which he desired.
