eaten, as a teil tree, and as an oak 
whose substance is in them when 
they cast their leaves; so the a holy 
seed shall be the substance thereof.

CHAPTER 17
Ephraim and Syria wage war against 
Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—
Compare Isaiah 7. About 559–545 b.c.
a And it came to pass in the days of 
b Ahaz the son of c Jotham, the son of 
Uzziah, king of Judah, that d Rezin, 
king of Syria, and e Pekah the son of 
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up 
toward  Jerusalem  to  war  against 
it, but could not prevail against it.
