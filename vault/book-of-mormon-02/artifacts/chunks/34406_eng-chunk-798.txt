CHAPTER 11
The  Father  testifies  of  His  Beloved 
Son—Christ  appears  and  proclaims 
His  Atonement—The  people  feel  the 
wound  marks  in  His  hands  and  feet 
and side—They cry Hosanna—He sets  
forth the mode and manner of baptism 
—The  spirit  of  contention  is  of  the 
devil—Christ’s  doctrine  is  that  men 
should believe and be baptized and re-
ceive the Holy Ghost. About a.d. 34.
And now it came to pass that there 
were  a  great  multitude  a gathered 
together,  of  the  people  of  Nephi, 
round about the temple which was 
in  the  land  b Bountiful;  and  they 
were marveling and wondering one 
with another, and were showing one 
to another the  c great and marvel-
ous change which had taken place.
2 And they were also conversing 
about  this  Jesus  Christ,  of  whom 
the a sign had been given concern-
ing his death.

3 And it came to pass that while 
they were thus conversing one with 
another, they heard a a voice as if it 
came out of heaven; and they cast 
their  eyes  round  about,  for  they 
understood  not  the  voice  which 
they heard; and it was not a harsh 
voice, neither was it a loud voice; 
nevertheless, and notwithstanding 
it being a b small voice it did c pierce 
them  that  did  hear  to  the  center, 
insomuch  that  there  was  no  part 
of their frame that it did not cause 
to quake; yea, it did pierce them to 
the very soul, and did cause their 
hearts to burn.

4 And it came to pass that again 
they heard the voice, and they a un-
derstood it not.

5 And again the third time they did 
hear the voice, and did a open their 
ears to hear it; and their eyes were  
towards the sound thereof; and they 
did look steadfastly towards heaven, 
from whence the sound came.
