45 And  now  I  say,  is  there  not 
a  a type  in  this  thing?  For  just  as 
surely as this director did bring our 
fathers, by following its course, to 
the promised land, shall the words 
of Christ, if we follow their course, 
carry us beyond this vale of sorrow 
into a far better land of promise.

46 O  my  son,  do  not  let  us  be 
a slothful  because  of  the  b easiness 
of the c way; for so was it with our 
fathers; for so was it prepared for 
them, that if they would d look they 
might  e live;  even  so  it  is  with  us. 
The way is prepared, and if we will 
look we may live forever.

47 And now, my son, see that ye 
take  a care  of  these  sacred  things, 
yea,  see  that  ye  b look  to  God  and 
live.  Go  unto  this  people  and  de-
clare  the  word,  and  be  sober.  My 
son, farewell.

The commandments of Alma to his 
son Shiblon.

Comprising chapter 38.

CHAPTER 38

Shiblon was persecuted for righteous-
ness’ sake—Salvation is in Christ, who

is the life and the light of the world—
Bridle all your passions. About 74 b.c.
My a son, give ear to my words, for 
I say unto you, even as I said unto 
Helaman, that b inasmuch as ye shall 
keep  the  commandments  of  God 
ye  shall  prosper  in  the  land;  and 
inasmuch as ye will not keep the 
commandments of God ye shall be 
c cut off from his d presence.

2 And now, my son, I trust that I 
shall have great joy in you, because 
of your a steadiness and your faith-
fulness unto God; for as you have 
commenced in your youth to look 
to the Lord your God, even so I hope 
that you will continue in keeping 
his commandments; for blessed is 
he that b endureth to the end.

3 I  say  unto  you,  my  son,  that  I 
have had great joy in thee already, 
because of thy faithfulness and thy  
diligence,  and  thy  patience  and  
thy long-suffering among the peo-
ple of the a Zoramites.
