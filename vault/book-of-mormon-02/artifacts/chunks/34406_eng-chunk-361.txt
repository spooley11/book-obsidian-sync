MOSIAH 21  : 16–29

did hear their b cries, and began to 
soften the hearts of the Lamanites 
that they began to ease their bur-
dens; yet the Lord did not see fit to 
deliver them out of bondage.

16 And it came to pass that they 
began to prosper by degrees in the 
land, and began to raise grain more 
abundantly, and flocks, and herds, 
that they did not suffer with hunger.
17 Now there was a great number 
of women, more than there was of 
men;  therefore  king  Limhi  com-
manded that every man should a im-
part to the support of the b widows 
and their children, that they might 
not  perish  with  hunger;  and  this 
they did because of the greatness of 
their number that had been slain.
18 Now the people of Limhi kept 
together in a body as much as it was 
possible,  and  secured  their  grain 
and their flocks;

19 And the king himself did not 
trust his person without the walls 
of the city, unless he took his guards 
with him, fearing that he might by 
some means fall into the hands of 
the Lamanites.

20 And he caused that his people 
should watch the land round about, 
that by some means they might take 
those priests that fled into the wil-
derness, who had stolen the a daugh-
ters of the Lamanites, and that had 
caused such a great destruction to 
come upon them.

21 For they were desirous to take 
them that they might a punish them; 
for  they  had  come  into  the  land 
of Nephi by night, and carried off 
their grain and many of their pre-
cious  things;  therefore  they  laid 
wait for them.

22 And it came to pass that there 
was no more disturbance between 
the  Lamanites  and  the  people  of

Limhi,  even  until  the  time  that 
a Ammon  and  his  brethren  came 
into the land.
