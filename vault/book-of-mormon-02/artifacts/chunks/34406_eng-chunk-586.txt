12 And now behold, is the meaning  
of  the  word  restoration  to  take  a 
thing of a natural state and place it  
in an unnatural state, or to place 
it in a state opposite to its nature?
13 O, my son, this is not the case; 
but the meaning of the word resto-
ration is to bring back again a evil  
for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devil-
ish for devilish—good for that which 
is good; righteous for that which is 
righteous; just for that which is just; 
merciful for that which is merciful.

ALMA 41  : 14–42  : 8

14 Therefore, my son, see that you 
are  merciful  unto  your  brethren; 
deal a justly, b judge righteously, and 
do c good continually; and if ye do 
all these things then shall ye receive 
your  d reward;  yea,  ye  shall  have 
e mercy  restored  unto  you  again; 
ye shall have justice restored unto 
you again; ye shall have a righteous 
judgment restored unto you again; 
and  ye  shall  have  good  rewarded 
unto you again.

15 For that which ye do a send out 
shall return unto you again, and be 
restored;  therefore,  the  word  res-
toration  more  fully  condemneth 
the sinner, and justifieth him not  
at all.
