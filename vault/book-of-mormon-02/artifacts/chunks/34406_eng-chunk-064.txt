1 NEPHI 14  : 12–23

looked and beheld the whore of all 
the earth, and she sat upon many 
a waters; and she had dominion over 
b all  the  earth,  among  all  nations, 
kindreds, tongues, and people.

12 And it came to pass that I beheld 
the church of the Lamb of God, and 
its numbers were a few, because of 
the wickedness and abominations  
of the whore who sat upon many 
waters; nevertheless, I beheld that 
the church of the Lamb, who were 
the saints of God, were also upon 
b all the face of the earth; and their  
dominions upon the face of the earth  
were small, because of the wicked-
ness of the great whore whom I saw.
13 And it came to pass that I beheld  
that the great mother of abomina-
tions did gather together multitudes 
upon the face of all the earth, among 
all  the  nations  of  the  Gentiles,  to 
a fight against the Lamb of God.

14 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I, 
Nephi,  beheld  the  power  of  the 
Lamb of God, that it descended upon 
the saints of the church of the Lamb, 
and  upon  the  covenant  people  of 
the Lord, who were scattered upon 
all the face of the earth; and they 
were  a armed  with  b righteousness 
and with the c power of God in great  
glory.

15 And it came to pass that I beheld 
that the wrath of God was a poured 
out upon that great and abominable 
church, insomuch that there were 
wars  and  rumors  of  wars  among 
all  the  b nations  and  kindreds  of 
the earth.

16 And as there began to be a wars 
and rumors of wars among all the

nations  which  belonged  to  the 
mother of abominations, the angel 
spake unto me, saying: Behold, the 
wrath of God is upon the mother 
of harlots; and behold, thou seest 
all these things—
