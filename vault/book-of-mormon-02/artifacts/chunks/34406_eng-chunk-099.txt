6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; 
and will ye a not declare them? And 
that I have showed thee new things 
from this time, even hidden things, 
and thou didst not know them.

7 They are created now, and not 
from  the  beginning,  even  before 
the day when thou heardest them 
not they were declared unto thee, 
lest  thou  shouldst  say—Behold  I 
knew them.

8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, 
thou  knewest  not;  yea,  from  that 
time thine ear was not opened; for 
I knew that thou wouldst deal very 
treacherously,  and  wast  called  a 
a transgressor from the womb.

9 Nevertheless,  for  my  a name’s  
sake will I defer mine anger, and 
for  my  praise  will  I  refrain  from 
thee, that I cut thee not off.

10 For, behold, I have refined thee, 
I have chosen thee in the furnace 
of a affliction.

11 For  mine  own  sake,  yea,  for 
mine own sake will I do this, for I 
will not suffer my a name to be pol-
luted, and I will b not give my glory 
unto another.

12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and 
Israel my called, for I am he; I am 
the a first, and I am also the last.

13 Mine  hand  hath  also  a laid 
the  foundation  of  the  earth,  and 
my  right  hand  hath  spanned  the

heavens. I b call unto them and they 
stand up together.

14 All  ye,  assemble  yourselves, 
and  hear;  who  among  them  hath 
declared these things unto them? 
The Lord hath loved him; yea, and 
he  will  a fulfil  his  word  which  he 
hath  declared  by  them;  and  he 
will  do  his  pleasure  on  b Babylon, 
and  his  arm  shall  come  upon  the  
Chaldeans.

15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, 
yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called 
a him  to  declare,  I  have  brought 
him,  and  he  shall  make  his  way 
prosperous.

16 Come ye near unto me; I have 
not  spoken  in  a secret;  from  the 
beginning,  from  the  time  that  it 
was  declared  have  I  spoken;  and 
the Lord God, and his b Spirit, hath  
sent me.

17 And  thus  saith  the  Lord,  thy 
a Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; 
I have sent him, the Lord thy God 
who  teacheth  thee  to  profit,  who 
b leadeth  thee  by  the  way  thou 
shouldst go, hath done it.
