of Christ, by f  baptism—yea, by fol-
lowing your Lord and your Savior 
down into the water, according to his 
word, behold, then shall ye receive 
the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh 
the g baptism of fire and of the Holy 
Ghost; and then can ye speak with 
the  h tongue  of  angels,  and  shout  
praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
14 But, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, thus came the voice of the Son 
unto me, saying: After ye have re-
pented of your sins, and witnessed 
unto the Father that ye are willing 
to keep my commandments, by the 
baptism of water, and have received 
the baptism of fire and of the Holy 
Ghost, and can speak with a new 
tongue, yea, even with the tongue of 
angels, and after this should a deny 
me, it would have been b better for 
you that ye had not known me.

15 And I heard a voice from the 
Father,  saying: Yea, the  a words  of 
my Beloved are true and faithful. 
He that b endureth to the c end, the 
same shall be saved.

16 And now, my beloved brethren, 
I  know  by  this  that  unless  a  man 
shall a endure to the end, in follow-
ing the b example of the Son of the 
living God, he cannot be saved.

17 Wherefore, do the things which 
I have told you I have seen that your 
Lord and your Redeemer should do; 
for, for this cause have they been 
shown unto me, that ye might know

the gate by which ye should enter. 
For  the  gate  by  which  ye  should 
enter  is  repentance  and  a baptism 
by  water;  and  then  cometh  a  b re-
mission of your sins by fire and by 
the Holy Ghost.

18 And then are ye in this a strait 
and  narrow  b path  which  leads  to 
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in 
by the gate; ye have done according 
to the commandments of the Father 
and the Son; and ye have received 
the Holy Ghost, which c witnesses of 
the  d Father and the Son, unto the 
fulfilling of the promise which he 
hath made, that if ye entered in by 
the way ye should receive.
