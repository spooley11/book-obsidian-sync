25 Wherefore,  he  has  given  a  
a law;  and  where  there  is  b no  c law 
given there is no d punishment; and 
where there is no punishment there 
is  no  condemnation;  and  where 
there is no condemnation the mer-
cies of the Holy One of Israel have 
claim  upon  them,  because  of  the 
atonement; for they are delivered 
by the power of him.

26 For  the  a atonement  satisfieth 
the demands of his b justice upon all 
those who c have not the d law given 
to  them,  that  they  are  e delivered 
from that awful monster, death and 
f  hell, and the devil, and the lake of 
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment; and they are restored 
to that God who gave them g breath, 
which is the Holy One of Israel.

27 But wo unto him that has the 
a law  given,  yea,  that  has  all  the  
commandments of God, like unto us, 
and that b transgresseth them, and

that c wasteth the days of his d pro-
bation, for awful is his state!

28 O that cunning a plan of the evil

When they are d learned they think 
they are e wise, and they f  hearken not 
unto the g counsel of God, for they 
set it aside, supposing they know of 
themselves, wherefore, their  h wis-
dom is foolishness and it profiteth 
them not. And they shall perish.

29 But  to  be  a learned  is  good  if 
they b hearken unto the c counsels of  
God.

30 But wo unto the a rich, who are 
b rich as to the things of the c world. 
For because they are rich they de-
spise the d poor, and they persecute 
the meek, and their e hearts are upon 
their  treasures;  wherefore,  their 
f treasure is their god. And behold, 
their  g treasure  shall  perish  with 
them also.

31 And wo unto the deaf that will

not a hear; for they shall perish.

32 Wo  unto  the  a blind  that  will

not see; for they shall perish also.

33 Wo  unto  the  a uncircumcised 
of heart, for a knowledge of their
