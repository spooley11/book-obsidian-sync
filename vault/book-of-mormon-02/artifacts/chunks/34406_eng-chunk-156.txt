48 Behold, if ye were holy I would 
speak unto you of holiness; but as 
ye are not holy, and ye look upon 
me as a a teacher, it must needs be 
expedient that I b teach you the con-
sequences of sin.

49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, 
and my heart  a delighteth in righ-
teousness; and I will b praise the holy  
name of my God.

50 Come, my brethren, every one 
that a thirsteth, come ye to the b wa-
ters; and he that hath no  c money, 
come buy and eat; yea, come buy 
wine and milk without money and 
without price.

51 Wherefore, do not spend money 
for that which is of no worth, nor 
your a labor for that which cannot 
b satisfy.  Hearken  diligently  unto 
me, and remember the words which 
I have spoken; and come unto the 
Holy One of Israel, and c feast upon 
that which perisheth not, neither 
can be corrupted, and let your soul 
delight in fatness.

52 Behold, my beloved brethren, 
remember the words of your God; 
pray unto him continually by day, 
and give a thanks unto his holy name 
by night. Let your hearts b rejoice.
53 And behold how great the a cov-
enants of the Lord, and how great his 
b condescensions unto the children of  
men; and because of his greatness, 
and his c grace and d mercy, he has 
promised unto us that our seed shall 
not utterly be destroyed, according 
to the flesh, but that he would e pre-
serve them; and in future genera-
tions they shall become a righteous 
f  branch unto the house of Israel.

54 And now, my brethren, I would 
speak  unto  you  more;  but  on  the 
morrow  I  will  declare  unto  you 
the remainder of my words. Amen.
