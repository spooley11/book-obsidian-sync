14 And it came to pass that Gid-
dianhi, who had stood and fought 
with boldness, was pursued as he 
fled; and being weary because of 
his much fighting he was overtaken 
and slain. And thus was the end of 
Giddianhi the robber.

15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
armies of the Nephites did return 
again to their place of security. And 
it came to pass that this nineteenth 
year  did  pass  away,  and  the  rob-
bers did not come again to battle; 
neither did they come again in the 
twentieth year.

16 And in the twenty and first year 
they did not come up to battle, but 
they came up on all sides to lay siege 
round about the people of Nephi; 
for  they  did  suppose  that  if  they 
should cut off the people of Nephi 
from their a lands, and should hem 
them in on every side, and if they 
should cut them off from all their 
outward privileges, that they could 
cause them to yield themselves up 
according to their wishes.

17 Now they had appointed unto 
themselves  another  leader,  whose 
name  was  Zemnarihah;  therefore

siege sufficiently long to have any 
effect upon the Nephites, because 
of  their  a much  b provision  which 
they had laid up in store,

19 And because of the scantiness 
of  provisions  among  the  robbers; 
for behold, they had nothing save 
it were meat for their subsistence, 
which meat they did obtain in the 
wilderness;

20 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
a wild game became scarce in the wil-
derness insomuch that the robbers 
were about to perish with hunger.
21 And the Nephites were continu-
ally  marching  out  by  day  and  by 
night, and falling upon their armies, 
and cutting them off by thousands 
and by tens of thousands.
