8 Now  the  sons  of  Mosiah  were 
numbered among the a unbelievers; 
and also one of the sons of Alma was  
numbered  among  them,  he  being 
called Alma, after his father; never-
theless, he became a very wicked 
and  an  b idolatrous  man.  And  he 
was a man of many words, and did 
speak much c flattery to the people; 
therefore he d led many of the peo-
ple to do after the manner of his 
e iniquities.

9 And he became a great hinder-
ment to the prosperity of the church 
of God; a stealing away the hearts of 
the people; causing much dissension 
among the people; giving a chance 
for  the  enemy  of  God  to  exercise 
his b power over them.

10 And now it came to pass that 
while he was going about to a destroy 
the  church  of  God,  for  he  did  go 
about secretly with the sons of Mo-
siah seeking to destroy the church,

and to lead astray the people of the 
Lord,  contrary  to  the  command-
ments of God, or even the king—

11 And as I said unto you, as they 
were going about a rebelling against 
God, behold, the b angel of the Lord 
c appeared  unto  them;  and  he  de-
scended as it were in a d cloud; and 
he spake as it were with a voice of 
thunder, which caused the earth to 
shake upon which they stood;

12 And so great was their aston-
ishment, that they fell to the earth, 
and understood not the words which 
he spake unto them.
