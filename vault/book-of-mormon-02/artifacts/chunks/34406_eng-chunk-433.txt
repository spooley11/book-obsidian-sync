was  an  hungered,  and  he  said  to 
a man: Will ye give to an humble 
servant of God something to eat?

20 And the man said unto him: I 
am a Nephite, and I know that thou 
art a holy prophet of God, for thou 
art the man whom an a angel said in 
a vision: Thou shalt receive. There-
fore,  go  with  me  into  my  house 
and I will impart unto thee of my 
b food; and I know that thou wilt be 
a blessing unto me and my house.
21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
man received him into his house; 
and  the  man  was  called  Amulek; 
and  he  brought  forth  bread  and 
meat and set before Alma.

22 And it came to pass that Alma 
ate  bread  and  was  filled;  and  he 
a blessed Amulek and his house, and 
he gave thanks unto God.

23 And  after  he  had  eaten  and 
was filled he said unto Amulek: I 
am Alma, and am the a high priest 
over the church of God throughout 
the land.

24 And behold, I have been called 
to preach the word of God among all 
this people, according to the spirit 
of revelation and prophecy; and I 
was  in  this  land  and  they  would 
not receive me, but they  a cast me 
out and I was about to set my back 
towards this land forever.
