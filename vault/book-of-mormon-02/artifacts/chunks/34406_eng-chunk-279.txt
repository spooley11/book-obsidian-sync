to deliver up the a record which  
    I have been making into the 
hands of my son Moroni, behold I 
have  witnessed  almost  all  the  de-
struction of my people, the Nephites.
2 And it is a many hundred years  
after the coming of Christ that I de-
liver these records into the hands of 
my son; and it supposeth me that he 
will witness the entire b destruction 
of my people. But may God grant  
that he may survive them, that he  
may  write  somewhat  concerning  
them,  and  somewhat  concerning 
Christ,  that  perhaps  some  day  it 
may c profit them.

3 And now, I speak somewhat con-
cerning that which I have written; 
for after I had made an a abridgment 
from the b plates of Nephi, down to

the reign of this king Benjamin, of 
whom  Amaleki  spake,  I  searched 
among the c records which had been 
delivered into my hands, and I found 
these plates, which contained this 
small account of the prophets, from 
Jacob down to the reign of this king 
d Benjamin,  and  also  many  of  the 
words of Nephi.

4 And the things which are upon 
these plates a pleasing me, because 
of the prophecies of the coming of 
Christ; and my fathers knowing that 
many of them have been fulfilled; 
yea, and I also know that as many 
things  as  have  been  b prophesied 
concerning  us  down  to  this  day 
have  been  fulfilled,  and  as  many 
as go beyond this day must surely 
come to pass—

5 Wherefore, I chose a these things, 
to  finish  my  b record  upon  them, 
which  remainder  of  my  record  I 
shall take from the c plates of Nephi; 
and I cannot write the d hundredth 
part of the things of my people.

6 But  behold,  I  shall  take  these
