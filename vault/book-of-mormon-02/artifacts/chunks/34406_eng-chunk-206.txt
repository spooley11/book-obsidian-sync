2 And when that day shall come 
they shall be a visited of the Lord of 
Hosts, with thunder and with earth-
quake, and with a great noise, and  
with storm, and with tempest, and 
with the b flame of devouring fire.
3 And all the a nations that b fight 
against Zion, and that distress her, 
shall be as a dream of a night vision;  
yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto  
a hungry man which dreameth, and 
behold  he  eateth  but  he  awak eth 
and his soul is empty; or like unto 
a thirsty man which dreameth, and 
behold he drinketh but he awak eth 
and behold he is faint, and his soul

hath appetite; yea, even so shall the 
multitude of all the nations be that 
fight against Mount Zion.

4 For behold, all ye that doeth in-
iquity, stay yourselves and wonder, 
for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye  
shall be a drunken but not with wine,  
ye shall stagger but not with strong 
drink.

5 For behold, the Lord hath poured 
out  upon  you  the  spirit  of  deep 
sleep.  For  behold,  ye  have  closed 
your a eyes, and ye have b rejected the  
prophets; and your rulers, and the 
seers  hath  he  covered  because  of 
your iniquity.

a you the words of a b book, and they 
shall be the words of them which 
have slumbered.

7 And  behold  the  book  shall  be  
a sealed; and in the book shall be a 
b revelation from God, from the be-
ginning of the world to the c ending 
thereof.

8 Wherefore, because of the things 
which  are  a sealed  up,  the  things 
which are sealed shall not be deliv-
ered in the day of the wickedness 
and  abominations  of  the  people. 
Wherefore the book shall be kept 
from them.

9 But the book shall be delivered 
unto  a  man,  and  he  shall  deliver  
the words of the book, which are the  
words of those who have slumbered 
in  the  dust,  and  he  shall  deliver 
these words unto a another;

10 But the words which are a sealed 
he shall not deliver, neither shall he 
deliver the book. For the book shall
