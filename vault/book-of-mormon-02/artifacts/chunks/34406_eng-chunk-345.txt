MOSIAH 16  : 10–17  : 8

that  can  never  be  darkened;  yea, 
and  also  a  life  which  is  endless, 
that there can be no more death.

10 Even this mortal shall put on 
a immortality, and this b corruption 
shall put on incorruption, and shall 
be brought to c stand before the bar 
of God, to be judged of him accord-
ing to their works whether they be 
good or whether they be evil—

11 If  they  be  good,  to  the  resur-
rection  of  a endless  life  and  b hap-
piness; and if they be evil, to the 
resurrection of c endless damnation, 
being  delivered  up  to  the  devil, 
who  hath  subjected  them,  which 
is damnation—

12 Having gone according to their 
own carnal wills and desires; hav-
ing  never  called  upon  the  Lord 
while the arms of mercy were ex-
tended towards them; for the arms 
of  mercy  were  extended  towards 
them,  and  they  would  a not;  they 
being  warned  of  their  iniquities 
and yet they would not depart from 
them; and they were commanded 
to  repent  and  yet  they  would  
not repent.

13 And now, ought ye not to trem-
ble and repent of your sins, and re-
member that only in and through 
Christ ye can be saved?

14 Therefore, if ye teach the a law 
of  Moses,  also  teach  that  it  is  a 
b shadow of those things which are  
to come—

15 Teach  them  that  redemption 
cometh through Christ the Lord, who  
is the very a Eternal Father. Amen.

of Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death by

fire—He prophesies disease and death by 
fire upon his murderers. About 148 b.c.
