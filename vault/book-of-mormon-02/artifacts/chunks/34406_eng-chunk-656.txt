23 For  we  knew  in  those  cities 
they  were  not  sufficiently  strong 
to  meet  them;  therefore  we  were 
desirous, if they should pass by us, 
to fall upon them in their rear, and 
thus bring them up in the rear at 
the same time they were met in the 
front. We supposed that we could 
overpower  them;  but  behold,  we 
were disappointed in this our desire.
24 They durst not pass by us with 
their  whole  army,  neither  durst 
they with a part, lest they should 
not be sufficiently strong and they 
should fall.

25 Neither durst they march down 
against the city of Zarahemla; nei-
ther  durst  they  cross  the  head  of 
Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.
26 And  thus,  with  their  forces, 
they were determined to maintain 
those cities which they had taken.
27 And now it came to pass in the 
second month of this year, there was 
brought  unto  us  many  provisions 
from the fathers of those my two 
thousand sons.

28 And also there were sent two 
thousand  men  unto  us  from  the 
land  of  Zarahemla.  And  thus  we 
were prepared with ten thousand 
men,  and  provisions  for  them, 
and also for their wives and their  
children.

29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing 
our forces increase daily, and pro-
visions arrive for our support, they 
began to be fearful, and began to 
sally forth, if it were possible to put 
an end to our receiving provisions 
and strength.

30 Now  when  we  saw  that  the 
Lamanites  began  to  grow  uneasy 
on  this  wise,  we  were  desirous  to 
bring a stratagem into effect upon 
them;  therefore  Antipus  ordered 
that I should march forth with my

little sons to a neighboring city, a as 
if we were carrying provisions to a 
neighboring city.

31 And we were to march near the 
city of Antiparah, as if we were go-
ing to the city beyond, in the bor-
ders by the seashore.

32 And it came to pass that we did 
march forth, as if with our provi-
sions, to go to that city.
