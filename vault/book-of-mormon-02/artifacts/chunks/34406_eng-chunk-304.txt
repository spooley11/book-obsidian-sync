20 And behold, even at this time, 
ye have been calling on his name, 
and begging for a a remission of your 
sins.  And  has  he  suffered  that  ye 
have begged in vain? Nay; he has 
poured out his b Spirit upon you, and 
has caused that your hearts should 
be filled with c joy, and has caused 
that your mouths should be stopped 
that  ye  could  not  find  utterance, 
so exceedingly great was your joy.
21 And now, if God, who has cre-
ated you, on whom you are depen-
dent for your lives and for all that 
ye  have  and  are,  doth  grant  unto 
you whatsoever ye ask that is right, 
in faith, believing that ye shall re-
ceive, O then, how ye ought to a im-
part of the substance that ye have 
one to another.

22 And if ye a judge the man who 
putteth up his petition to you for 
your substance that he perish not, 
and condemn him, how much more 
just will be your b condemnation for 
withholding your substance, which 
doth not belong to you but to God, 
to whom also your life c belongeth; 
and yet ye put up no petition, nor 
repent  of  the  thing  which  thou  
hast done.

23 I say unto you, wo be unto that 
man, for his substance shall perish 
with him; and now, I say these things 
unto  those  who  are  a rich  as  per-
taining to the things of this world.
24 And again, I say unto the poor, 
ye who have not and yet have suf-
ficient,  that  ye  remain  from  day 
to  day;  I  mean  all  you  who  deny
