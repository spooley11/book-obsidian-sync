53 But  behold,  the  devil  hath 
a deceived  me;  for  he  b appeared 
unto me in the  c form of an angel, 
and said unto me: Go and reclaim 
this people, for they have all gone

astray after an unknown God. And 
he said unto me: There is d no God; 
yea, and he taught me that which 
I should say. And I have taught his 
words; and I taught them because 
they  were  pleasing  unto  the  e car-
nal mind; and I taught them, even 
until I had much success, insomuch 
that I verily believed that they were 
true; and for this cause I withstood 
the truth, even until I have brought 
this great f curse upon me.

54 Now when he had said this, he 
besought  that  Alma  should  pray 
unto God, that the a curse might be 
taken from him.

55 But Alma said unto him: If this 
curse should be taken from thee thou 
wouldst again lead away the hearts 
of  this  people;  therefore,  it  shall  
be unto thee even as the Lord will.
56 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
curse  was  not  taken  off  of  Kori-
hor; but he was a cast out, and went 
about from house to house begging 
for his food.

57 Now  the  knowledge  of  what 
had  happened  unto  Korihor  was 
immediately published throughout 
all the land; yea, the proclamation 
was sent forth by the chief judge to 
all the people in the land, declar-
ing  unto  those  who  had  believed 
in the words of Korihor that they 
must speedily repent, a lest the same 
judgments would come unto them.
58 And it came to pass that they 
were all convinced of the wicked-
ness of Korihor; therefore they were 
all converted again unto the Lord; 
and this put an end to the iniquity 
after the manner of Korihor. And 
Korihor did go about from house to 
house, begging food for his support.
59 And it came to pass that as he 
went forth among the people, yea, 
among a people who had separated 
themselves from the Nephites and 
called themselves a Zoramites, being
