13 For  a he saith: By the strength 
of b my hand and by my wisdom I 
have  done  these  things;  for  I  am 
prudent; and I have moved the bor-
ders of the people, and have robbed 
their treasures, and I have put down 
the inhabitants like a valiant man;
14 And my hand hath found as a 
nest the riches of the people; and 
as one gathereth eggs that are left 
have I gathered all the earth; and 
there was none that moved the wing, 
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15 Shall the a ax boast itself against 
him that heweth therewith? Shall 
the saw magnify itself against him 
that shaketh it? As if the rod should 
shake itself against them that lift it 
up, or as if the staff should lift up 
itself as if it were no wood!

16 Therefore  shall  the  Lord,  the 
Lord of Hosts, send among his fat 
ones, leanness; and under his glory 
he shall kindle a burning like the 
burning of a fire.

17 And the light of Israel shall be for  
a a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, 
and shall burn and shall devour his 
thorns and his briers in one day;

18 And  shall  consume  the  glory 
of  his  forest,  and  of  his  fruitful 
field, both soul and body; and they 
shall be as when a standard-bearer  
fainteth.

19 And  the  a rest  of  the  trees  of 
his forest shall be few, that a child 
may write them.

20 And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that the remnant of Israel, and 
such as are escaped of the  a house 
of Jacob, shall no more again b stay 
upon  him  that  smote  them,  but 
shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy 
One of Israel, in truth.

21 The a remnant shall return, yea, 
even the remnant of Jacob, unto the 
mighty God.

22 For though thy people  a Israel 
be as the sand of the sea, yet a rem-
nant of them shall b return; the c con-
sumption  decreed  shall  overflow 
with righteousness.

23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall 
make a a consumption, even deter-
mined in all the land.
