19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites did pursue the Amlicites 
all that day, and did slay them with 
much slaughter, insomuch that there 
were a slain of the Amlicites twelve 
thousand five hundred thirty and 
two souls; and there were slain of 
the Nephites six thousand five hun-
dred sixty and two souls.

20 And it came to pass that when 
Alma  could  pursue  the  Amlicites 
no longer he caused that his peo-
ple should pitch their tents in the 
a valley of Gideon, the valley being 
called after that Gideon who was 
slain by the hand of  b Nehor with 
the  sword;  and  in  this  valley  the 
Nephites did pitch their tents for  
the night.

21 And Alma sent spies to follow 
the remnant of the Amlicites, that 
he might know of their plans and 
their plots, whereby he might guard 
himself against them, that he might 
preserve  his  people  from  being  
destroyed.

22 Now those whom he had sent 
out to watch the camp of the Amli-
cites were called Zeram, and Amnor, 
and Manti, and Limher; these were 
they who went out with their men 
to watch the camp of the Amlicites.
23 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow they returned into the camp 
of the Nephites in great haste, be-
ing greatly astonished, and struck 
with much fear, saying:

24 Behold, we followed the a camp 
of the b Amlicites, and to our great 
astonishment,  in  the  land  of  Mi-
non, above the land of Zarahemla, 
in the course of the land of c Nephi, 
we saw a numerous host of the La-
manites; and behold, the Amlicites 
have joined them;

25 And they are upon our brethren 
in that land; and they are fleeing 
before them with their flocks, and 
their wives, and their children, to-
wards our city; and except we make 
haste they obtain possession of our 
city, and our fathers, and our wives, 
and our children be slain.

26 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
people  of  Nephi  took  their  tents, 
and departed out of the valley of 
Gideon towards their  a city, which 
was the city of b Zarahemla.
