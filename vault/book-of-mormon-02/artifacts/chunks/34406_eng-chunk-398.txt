ALMA 1  : 13–25

b priestcraft to be enforced among 
this  people  it  would  prove  their 
entire destruction.

13 And thou hast shed the a blood 
of a righteous man, yea, a man who 
has  done  much  good  among  this 
people; and were we to spare thee 
his blood would come upon us for 
b vengeance.

14 Therefore thou art condemned 
to a die, according to the b law which 
has been given us by Mosiah, our 
last king; and it has been c acknowl-
edged by this people; therefore this 
people must d abide by the law.

15 And it came to pass that they 
took him; and his name was a Nehor; 
and they carried him upon the top 
of the hill Manti, and there he was 
caused, or rather did acknowledge, 
between the heavens and the earth, 
that what he had taught to the peo-
ple was contrary to the word of God; 
and there he suffered an ignomini-
ous b death.

16 Nevertheless, this did not put an 
end to the spreading of priestcraft 
through  the  land;  for  there  were 
many  who  loved  the  vain  things 
of the world, and they went forth 
preaching  a false  doctrines;  and 
this they did for the sake of b riches  
and honor.

17 Nevertheless,  they  durst  not 
a lie,  if  it  were  known,  for  fear  of 
the  law,  for  liars  were  punished; 
therefore they pretended to preach 
according to their belief; and now 
the  law  could  have  no  power  on 
any man for b his belief.

18 And they durst not  a steal, for 
fear of the law, for such were pun-
ished; neither durst they rob, nor
