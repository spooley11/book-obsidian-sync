49 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto the 
servant: Let us go to and hew down 
the trees of the vineyard and cast 
them into the fire, that they shall 
not cumber the ground of my vine-
yard, for I have done all. What could 
I have done more for my vineyard?
50 But,  behold,  the  servant  said 
unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare 
it a little a longer.

51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will 
spare it a little longer, for it griev-
eth me that I should lose the trees 
of my vineyard.

52 Wherefore,  let  us  take  of  the 
a branches  of  these  which  I  have 
planted in the nethermost parts of  
my vineyard, and let us graft them 
into the tree from whence they came;  
and let us pluck from the tree those 
branches whose fruit is most bitter, 
and graft in the natural branches of 
the tree in the stead thereof.

53 And this will I do that the tree 
may  not  perish,  that,  perhaps,  I 
may preserve unto myself the roots 
thereof for mine a own purpose.
