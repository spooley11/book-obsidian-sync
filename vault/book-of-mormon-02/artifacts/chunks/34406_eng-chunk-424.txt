CHAPTER 6
The Church in Zarahemla is cleansed 
and set in order—Alma goes to Gideon 
to preach. About 83 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
Alma had made an end of speak-
ing unto the people of the church, 
which was established in the city of  
Zarahemla,  he  a ordained  b priests 
and elders, by laying on his c hands 
according  to  the  order  of  God,  to 
preside and d watch over the church.
2 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church 
who  a repented  of  their  sins  were 
baptized unto repentance, and were 
received into the church.

3 And  it  also  came  to  pass  that 
whosoever did belong to the church 
that did not a repent of their wick-
edness  and  humble  themselves  
before  God—I  mean  those  who  
were lifted up in the b pride of their  
hearts—the  same  were  rejected,  
and their names were c blotted out, 
that their names were not numbered 
among those of the righteous.

4 And thus they began to establish

the order of the church in the a city 
of Zarahemla.

5 Now I would that ye should un-
derstand that the word of God was 
liberal  unto  all,  that  none  were 
deprived of the privilege of assem-
bling themselves together to hear 
the word of God.

6 Nevertheless the children of God 
were commanded that they should 
gather themselves together oft, and 
join in a fasting and mighty prayer 
in behalf of the welfare of the souls 
of those who knew not God.

7 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when Alma had made these regu-
lations he departed from them, yea, 
from the church which was in the 
city  of  Zarahemla,  and  went  over 
upon the east of the a river Sidon, into 
the b valley of Gideon, there having 
been a city built, which was called 
the  city  of  Gideon,  which  was  in  
the valley that was called Gideon, 
being called after the man who was 
c slain  by  the  hand  of  Nehor  with 
the sword.
