MORONI 7  : 1–12

CHAPTER 7

An  invitation  is  given  to  enter  into 
the  rest  of  the  Lord—Pray  with  real 
intent—The  Spirit  of  Christ  enables 
men  to  know  good  from  evil—Satan 
persuades men to deny Christ and do 
evil—The prophets manifest the com-
ing  of  Christ—By  faith,  miracles  are 
wrought  and  angels  minister—Men 
should hope for eternal life and cleave 
unto charity. About a.d. 401–21.
And now I, Moroni, write a few of  
the  words  of  my  father  Mormon, 
which he spake concerning a faith, 
hope,  and  charity;  for  after  this  
manner did he speak unto the peo-
ple, as he taught them in the b syna-
gogue which they had built for the 
place of worship.

2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto 
you,  my  beloved  brethren;  and  it 
is by the a grace of God the Father, 
and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his 
holy will, because of the gift of his 
b calling unto me, that I am permit-
ted to speak unto you at this time.
3 Wherefore, I would speak unto 
you that are of the a church, that are 
the b peaceable followers of Christ, 
and that have obtained a sufficient 
c hope by which ye can enter into 
the d rest of the Lord, from this time 
henceforth until ye shall rest with 
him in heaven.

4 And now my brethren, I judge 
these things of you because of your 
peaceable a walk with the children 
of men.

5 For I remember the word of God 
which saith by their a works ye shall 
know  them;  for  if  their  works  be 
good, then they are good also.

6 For behold, God hath said a man 
being a evil cannot do that which is 
good;  for  if  he  b offereth  a  gift,  or 
c prayeth unto God, except he shall 
do it with real d intent it profiteth 
him nothing.

7 For behold, it is not counted unto

him for righteousness.

8 For behold, if a man being a evil 
giveth a gift, he doeth it b grudgingly; 
wherefore it is counted unto him 
the same as if he had retained the 
gift; wherefore he is counted evil 
before God.
