CHAPTER 4

Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites 
join forces and take the land of Zara-
hemla—The Nephites’ defeats come be-
cause of their wickedness—The Church 
dwindles, and the people become weak 
like the Lamanites. About 38–30 b.c.
And it came to pass in the fifty and 
fourth year there were many dis-
sensions in the church, and there 
was also a  a contention among the 
people,  insomuch  that  there  was 
much bloodshed.

2 And  the  rebellious  part  were 
slain  and  driven  out  of  the  land, 
and  they  did  go  unto  the  king  of 
the Lamanites.

3 And it came to pass that they did 
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites 
to  a war  against  the  Nephites;  but 
behold, the Lamanites were b exceed-
ingly  afraid,  insomuch  that  they 
would not hearken to the words of 
those dissenters.

4 But it came to pass in the fifty 
and sixth year of the reign of the 
judges, there were a dissenters who 
went up from the Nephites unto the  
Lamanites; and they succeeded with 
those others in b stirring them up to  
anger against the Nephites; and they  
were all that year preparing for war.
5 And  in  the  fifty  and  seventh 
year they did come down against 
the  Nephites  to  battle,  and  they 
did commence the work of death; 
yea, insomuch that in the fifty and 
eighth year of the reign of the judges 
they succeeded in obtaining a pos-
session  of  the  land  of  Zarahemla; 
yea, and also all the lands, even unto 
the land which was near the land  
Bountiful.

6 And the Nephites and the armies

of Moronihah were driven even into 
the land of Bountiful;

7 And there they did fortify against 
the Lamanites, from the west sea, 
even unto the east; it being a a day’s 
journey for a Nephite, on the line 
which they had fortified and sta-
tioned their armies to defend their 
north country.

8 And  thus  those  a dissenters  of 
the  Nephites,  with  the  help  of  a 
numerous army of the Lamanites, 
had obtained all the possession of 
the Nephites which was in the land 
southward. And all this was done 
in the fifty and eighth and ninth 
years of the reign of the judges.
