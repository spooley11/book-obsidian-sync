15 And  it  came  to  pass  that  in 
the  three  hundred  and  sixty  and 
seventh  year,  the  Nephites  being 
angry because the Lamanites had 
sacrificed  their  women  and  their 
children, that they did go against 
the  Lamanites  with  exceedingly 
great  anger,  insomuch  that  they 
did beat again the Lamanites, and 
drive them out of their lands.

16 And  the  Lamanites  did  not 
come  again  against  the  Nephites 
until  the  three  hundred  and  sev-
enty and fifth year.

17 And in this year they did come 
down against the Nephites with all 
their  powers;  and  they  were  not 
numbered because of the greatness 
of their number.

18 And a from this time forth did 
the Nephites gain no power over the 
Lamanites, but began to be swept 
off by them even as a dew before 
the sun.

19 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites did come down against 
the a city Desolation; and there was 
an exceedingly sore battle fought in 
the land Desolation, in the which 
they did beat the Nephites.

20 And they fled again from be-
fore  them,  and  they  came  to  the 
city Boaz; and there they did stand 
against the Lamanites with exceed-
ing boldness, insomuch that the La-
manites did not beat them until they 
had come again the second time.

21 And when they had come the 
second  time,  the  Nephites  were 
driven  and  slaughtered  with  an 
exceedingly great slaughter; their 
women  and  their  a children  were 
again sacrificed unto idols.

22 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Nephites did again flee from before 
them, taking all the inhabitants with 
them, both in towns and villages.

23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that 
the Lamanites were about to over-
throw the land, therefore I did go 
to the hill a Shim, and did take up 
all  the  b records  which  Ammaron 
had hid up unto the Lord.
