30 Yea,  behold,  the  anger  of  the 
Lord is already kindled against you; 
behold, he hath cursed the land be-
cause of your iniquity.

31 And behold, the time cometh 
that  he  curseth  your  riches,  that 
they become a slippery, that ye can-
not hold them; and in the days of 
your poverty ye cannot retain them.
32 And in the days of your poverty 
ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in 
vain shall ye cry, for your desolation 
is already come upon you, and your 
destruction is made sure; and then 
shall ye weep and howl in that day, 
saith the Lord of Hosts. And then 
shall ye lament, and say:

33 O  a that  I  had  repented,  and 
had  not  killed  the  prophets,  and 
b stoned  them,  and  cast  them  out. 
Yea,  in  that  day  ye  shall  say:  O 
that we had remembered the Lord 
our God in the day that he gave us 
our  riches,  and  then  they  would 
not have become slippery that we 
should lose them; for behold, our 
riches are gone from us.

34 Behold, we lay a tool here and 
on the morrow it is gone; and be-
hold, our swords are taken from us  
in the day we have sought them for  
battle.

35 Yea, we have hid up our a trea-
sures and they have slipped away 
from  us,  because  of  the  curse  of 
the land.

36 O that we had repented in the

day that the word of the Lord came 
unto  us;  for  behold  the  land  is 
cursed, and all things are become 
slippery, and we cannot hold them.
37 Behold, we are surrounded by  
a demons, yea, we are encircled about 
by  the  angels  of  him  who  hath  
sought to destroy our souls. Behold, 
our  iniquities  are  great.  O  Lord, 
canst thou not turn away thine an-
ger from us? And this shall be your 
language in those days.
