8 And it supposeth me that they 
have  come  up  hither  to  hear  the 
pleasing a word of God, yea, the word 
which healeth the wounded soul.

9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul 
that  I  should  be  constrained,  be-
cause of the strict commandment 
which I have received from God, to 
a admonish  you  according  to  your 
crimes,  to  enlarge  the  wounds  of 
those who are already wounded, in-
stead of consoling and healing their 
wounds;  and  those  who  have  not 
been wounded, instead of feasting 
upon the pleasing word of God have 
daggers placed to pierce their souls 
and wound their delicate minds.

10 But, notwithstanding the great-
ness of the task, I must do according 
to the strict a commands of God, and 
tell you concerning your wickedness 
and abominations, in the presence 
of the pure in heart, and the broken 
heart, and under the glance of the 
b piercing eye of the Almighty God.
11 Wherefore, I must tell you the 
truth  according  to  the  a plainness 
of the b word of God. For behold, as 
I inquired of the Lord, thus came 
the  word  unto  me,  saying:  Jacob, 
get thou up into the temple on the 
morrow, and declare the word which 
I shall give thee unto this people.

12 And now behold, my brethren, 
this is the word which I declare unto  
you, that many of you have begun 
to search for gold, and for silver, and 
for all manner of precious a ores, in 
the which this land, which is a b land

of  promise  unto  you  and  to  your 
seed, doth abound most plentifully.
13 And  the  hand  of  providence 
hath smiled upon you most pleas-
ingly, that you have obtained many 
riches; and because some of you have 
obtained more abundantly than that 
of your brethren ye are a lifted up in 
the pride of your hearts, and wear 
stiff necks and high heads because 
of  the  costliness  of  your  apparel, 
and  persecute  your  brethren  be-
cause ye suppose that ye are better  
than they.
