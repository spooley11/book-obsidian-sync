6 And  he  also  read  the  account 
of Alma and his brethren, and all 
their afflictions, from the time they 
left the land of Zarahemla until the 
time they returned again.

7 And now, when Mosiah had made 
an end of reading the records, his 
people who tarried in the land were 
struck with wonder and amazement.
8 For they knew not what to think; 
for  when  they  beheld  those  that 
had been delivered a out of bondage 
they were filled with exceedingly 
great joy.

9 And again, when they thought of 
their brethren who had been a slain 
by the Lamanites they were filled 
with sorrow, and even shed many 
tears of sorrow.

10 And again, when they thought  
of  the  immediate  goodness  of  
God,  and  his  power  in  delivering 
Alma and his brethren out of the 
hands  of  the  Lamanites  and  of 
a bondage, they did raise their voices 
and give thanks to God.

11 And again, when they thought 
upon the Lamanites, who were their 
brethren, of their sinful and a pol-
luted  state,  they  were  filled  with 
b pain and anguish for the c welfare 
of their souls.

12 And it came to pass that those 
who a were the children of Amulon 
and his brethren, who had taken to  
wife  the  b daughters  of  the  La-
manites, were displeased with the 
conduct of their fathers, and they 
would no longer be called by the 
names  of  their  fathers,  therefore 
they  took  upon  themselves  the 
name of Nephi, that they might be  
called  the  children  of  Nephi  and  
be  numbered  among  those  who 
were c called Nephites.

13 And  now  all  the  people  of  
Zarahemla  were  a numbered  with 
the Nephites, and this because the 
kingdom had been conferred upon 
none but those who were descen-
dants of Nephi.

14 And now it came to pass that 
when Mosiah had made an end of 
speaking  and  reading  to  the  peo-
ple,  he  desired  that  Alma  should 
also speak to the people.

15 And Alma did speak unto them, 
when they were assembled together 
in large bodies, and he went from 
one body to another, preaching unto 
the people repentance and faith on 
the Lord.
