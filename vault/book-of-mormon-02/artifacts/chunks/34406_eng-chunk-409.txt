20 Now  it  came  to  pass  that  not 
many days after the battle which 
was  fought  in  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla,  by  the  Lamanites  and  the  
Amlicites,  that  there  was  another 
army  of  the  Lamanites  came  in 
upon  the  people  of  Nephi,  in  the 
a same  place  where  the  first  army 
met the Amlicites.

21 And it came to pass that there 
was an army sent to drive them out 
of their land.

22 Now  Alma  himself  being  af-
flicted  with  a  a wound  did  not  go 
up to battle at this time against the 
Lamanites;

23 But he sent up a numerous army 
against them; and they went up and 
slew  many  of  the  Lamanites,  and 
drove the remainder of them out of 
the borders of their land.

24 And then they returned again 
and began to establish peace in the 
land, being troubled no more for a 
time with their enemies.

25 Now all these things were done, 
yea, all these wars and contentions 
were  commenced  and  ended  in 
the  fifth  year  of  the  reign  of  the  
judges.

26 And  in  one  year  were  thou-
sands and tens of thousands of souls 
sent to the eternal world, that they 
might reap their a rewards according 
to their works, whether they were 
good or whether they were bad, to 
reap eternal happiness or eternal 
misery, according to the spirit which 
they listed to obey, whether it be a 
good spirit or a bad one.

27 For every man receiveth a wages 
of him whom he listeth to b obey, and 
this according to the words of the 
spirit of prophecy; therefore let it 
be according to the truth. And thus

endeth the fifth year of the reign 
of the judges.

CHAPTER 4

Alma  baptizes  thousands  of  con-
verts—Iniquity  enters  the  Church, 
and the Church’s progress is hindered—
Nephihah  is  appointed  chief  judge—
Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to 
the ministry. About 86– 83 b.c.
Now  it  came  to  pass  in  the  sixth 
year of the reign of the judges over 
the people of Nephi, there were no 
contentions nor wars in the  a land 
of Zarahemla;
