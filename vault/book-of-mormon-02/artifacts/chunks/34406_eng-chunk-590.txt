ALMA 42  : 23–31

a punishment affixed, and a b repen-
tance  granted;  which  repentance, 
mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice 
claimeth the creature and executeth 
the c law, and the law inflicteth the 
punishment;  if  not  so,  the  works 
of justice would be destroyed, and 
God would cease to be God.

23 But God ceaseth not to be God, 
and a mercy claimeth the penitent, 
and mercy cometh because of the 
b atonement;  and  the  atonement 
bringeth to pass the c resurrection of  
the  dead;  and  the  d resurrection 
of  the  dead  bringeth  e back  men 
into the presence of God; and thus 
they are restored into his presence, 
to  be  f judged  according  to  their 
works,  according  to  the  law  and  
justice.

24 For behold, justice exerciseth 
all  his  demands,  and  also  a mercy 
claimeth all which is her own; and 
thus,  none  but  the  truly  penitent 
are saved.

25 What, do ye suppose that a mercy 
can  rob  b justice?  I  say  unto  you, 
Nay; not one whit. If so, God would 
cease to be God.

26 And thus God bringeth about 
his  great  and  eternal  a purposes, 
which  were  prepared  b from  the 
foundation of the world. And thus 
cometh about the salvation and the 
redemption of men, and also their 
destruction and misery.

27 Therefore, O my son,  a whoso-
ever will come may come and par-
take  of  the  waters  of  life  freely; 
and whosoever will not come the 
same is not compelled to come; but
