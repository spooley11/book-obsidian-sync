9 For it is expedient that an a atone-
ment should be made; for according 
to the great b plan of the Eternal God 
there must be an atonement made, 
or else all mankind must unavoid-
ably perish; yea, all are hardened; 
yea, all are c fallen and are lost, and 
must  perish  except  it  be  through 
the atonement which it is expedient  
should be made.

10 For  it  is  expedient  that  there 
should be a great and last a sacrifice;  
yea, not a b sacrifice of man, neither 
of beast, neither of any manner of 
fowl;  for  it  shall  not  be  a  human 
sacrifice; but it must be an c infinite 
and d eternal e sacrifice.

294

11 Now there is not any man that 
can sacrifice his own blood which 
will atone for the sins of another. 
Now, if a man murdereth, behold 
will  our  law,  which  is  a just,  take 
the life of his brother? I say unto 
you, Nay.

12 But the law requireth the a life 
of him who hath b murdered; there-
fore there can be nothing which is 
short of an infinite atonement which  
will suffice for the sins of the world.
13 Therefore, it is expedient that 
there  should  be  a  great  and  last 
sacrifice, and then shall there be, 
or it is expedient there should be, 
a  a stop to the shedding of  b blood; 
then shall the c law of Moses be ful-
filled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, 
every jot and tittle, and none shall 
have passed away.
