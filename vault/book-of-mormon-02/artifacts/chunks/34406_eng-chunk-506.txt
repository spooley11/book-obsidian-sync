2 Yea,  he  sent  a  decree  among 
them, that they should not lay their 
hands  on  them  to  bind  them,  or 
to  cast  them  into  prison;  neither 
should  they  spit  upon  them,  nor 
smite  them,  nor  cast  them  out  of 
their a synagogues, nor scourge them; 
neither should they cast stones at 
them,  but  that  they  should  have 
free access to their houses, and also 
their temples, and their b sanctuaries.
3 And  thus  they  might  go  forth 
and preach the word according to 
their desires, for the king had been 
converted unto the Lord, and  a all 
his  b household;  therefore  he  sent  
his  proclamation  throughout  the 
land unto his people, that the word 
of God might have no obstruction, 
but that it might go forth through-
out  all  the  land,  that  his  people 
might  be  convinced  concerning  
the  wicked  c traditions  of  their 
fathers, and that they might be con-
vinced that they were all brethren, 
and that they ought not to murder, 
nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to 
commit  adultery,  nor  to  commit 
any manner of wickedness.

4 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
when the king had sent forth this 
proclamation, that Aaron and his 
brethren went forth from  a city to 
city, and from one house of worship 
to another, establishing churches, 
and consecrating b priests and teach-
ers throughout the land among the 
Lamanites, to preach and to teach 
the  word  of  God  among  them; 
and thus they began to have great  
success.

5 And  a thousands  were  brought 
to  the  knowledge  of  the  Lord, 
yea,  thousands  were  brought  to

believe  in  the  b traditions  of  the 
Nephites; and they were taught the 
c records and prophecies which were 
handed down even to the present  
time.

6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so  
sure as many as believed, or as many 
as were brought to the knowledge of  
the  truth,  through  the  preaching  
of Ammon and his brethren, accord-
ing to the spirit of revelation and 
of prophecy, and the power of God 
working a miracles in them—yea, I 
say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as 
many of the Lamanites as believed 
in their preaching, and were b con-
verted  unto  the  Lord,  c never  did 
fall away.
