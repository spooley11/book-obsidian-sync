4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be 
ashamed;  neither  be  thou  con-
founded, for thou shalt not be put to  
a shame;  for  thou  shalt  forget  the 
b shame of thy youth, and shalt not re-
member the c reproach of thy youth,  
and  shalt  not  remember  the  re-
proach of thy widowhood any more.
5 For thy maker, thy a husband, the 
Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy 
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel— 
the God of the whole earth shall he  
be called.

6 For the Lord hath called thee a as 
a woman forsaken and grieved in 
spirit,  and  a  wife  of  youth,  when 
thou wast refused, saith thy God.
7 For a small moment have I a for-
saken thee, but with great mercies 
will I gather thee.

8 In a little wrath I hid my face 
from thee for a moment, but with 
everlasting  a kindness  will  I  have 
b mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy 
Redeemer.

9 For  a this,  the  b waters  of  Noah 
unto me, for as I have sworn that 
the waters of Noah should no more 
go over the earth, so have I sworn 
that I would not be wroth with thee.
10 For the a mountains shall depart 
and the hills be removed, but my 
b kindness  shall  not  c depart  from 
thee,  neither  shall  the  covenant 
of my peace be removed, saith the 
Lord that hath mercy on thee.

11 O  thou  afflicted,  tossed  with 
tempest, and not comforted! Behold, 
I will lay thy a stones with fair col-
ors, and lay thy foundations with 
sapphires.

12 And I will make thy windows 
of agates, and thy gates of carbun-

cles, and all thy borders of pleasant  
stones.

13 And a all thy children shall be 
taught of the Lord; and great shall 
be the b peace of thy children.

14 In a righteousness shalt thou be 
established; thou shalt be far from 
oppression for thou shalt not fear, 
and from terror for it shall not come 
near thee.
