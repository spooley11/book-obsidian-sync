of  the  Lord,  as  the  waters  cover 
the sea.

10 And in that day there shall be 
a a root of Jesse, which shall stand 
for  an  ensign  of  the  people;  to  it 
shall  the  b Gentiles  seek;  and  his 
c rest shall be glorious.

11 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that day that the Lord shall set his 
hand again the a second time to re-
cover  the  remnant  of  his  people 
which shall be left, from b Assyria, 
and from Egypt, and from Pathros, 
and from Cush, and from Elam, and 
from  c Shinar,  and  from  Hamath,  
and from the islands of the sea.

12 And he shall set up an a ensign 
for the nations, and shall assemble 
the b outcasts of Israel, and c gather 
together  the  dispersed  of  Judah 
from the four corners of the earth.
13 The a envy of Ephraim also shall 
depart, and the adversaries of Judah 
shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not 
b envy c Judah, and Judah shall not 
vex Ephraim.

14 But  they  shall  fly  upon  the 
shoulders of the a Philistines towards 
the west; they shall spoil them of 
the  east  together;  they  shall  lay 
their hand upon b Edom and c Moab; 
and the children of Ammon shall 
obey them.
