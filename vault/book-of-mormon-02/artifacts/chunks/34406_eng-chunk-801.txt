22 And again the Lord called a oth-
ers,  and  said  unto  them  likewise; 
and  he  gave  unto  them  power  to 
baptize. And he said unto them: On 
this wise shall ye baptize; and there 
shall be b no disputations among you.
23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso 
repenteth of his sins through your 
a words, and b desireth to be baptized

in my name, on this wise shall ye 
baptize them—Behold, ye shall go 
down and c stand in the water, and 
in my name shall ye baptize them.
24 And now behold, these are the 
words  which  ye  shall  say,  calling 
them by name, saying:

25 Having a authority given me of 
Jesus  Christ,  I  baptize  you  in  the 
name of the b Father, and of the Son,  
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

26 And  then  shall  ye  a immerse 
them in the water, and come forth

and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are 
b one; and I am in the Father, and 
the  Father  in  me,  and  the  Father 
and I are one.

28 And according as I have com-
manded you thus shall ye baptize. 
And there shall be no a disputations 
among you, as there have hitherto 
been; neither shall there be dispu-
tations among you concerning the 
points of my doctrine, as there have 
hitherto been.

29 For verily, verily I say unto you, 
he that hath the spirit of a conten-
tion is not of me, but is of the b devil, 
who is the father of contention, and 
he  stirreth  up  the  hearts  of  men 
to  contend  with  anger,  one  with  
another.

30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, 
to stir up the hearts of men with 
anger, one against another; but this
