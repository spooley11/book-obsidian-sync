21 And the king came out to meet 
him with his guards, for he supposed 
that Amalickiah had a fulfilled his 
commands,  and  that  Amalickiah 
had gathered together so great an 
army  to  go  against  the  Nephites  
to battle.

22 But behold, as the king came 
out to meet him Amalickiah caused 
that his servants should go forth to 
meet the king. And they went and 
a bowed themselves before the king, 
as if to reverence him because of 
his greatness.

23 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
king  put  forth  his  hand  to  raise 
them, as was the custom with the La-
manites, as a token of peace, which 
custom  they  had  taken  from  the  
Nephites.

24 And it came to pass that when 
he  had  raised  the  first  from  the 
ground, behold he stabbed the king 
to the heart; and he fell to the earth.
25 Now  the  servants  of  the  king 
fled; and the servants of Amalick-
iah raised a cry, saying:

26 Behold, the servants of the king 
have stabbed him to the heart, and 
he  has  fallen  and  they  have  fled; 
behold, come and see.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that

Amalickiah  commanded  that  his 
armies should march forth and see 
what had happened to the king; and 
when they had come to the spot, and  
found  the  king  lying  in  his  gore, 
Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, 
and said: Whosoever loved the king, 
let him go forth, and pursue his ser-
vants that they may be slain.

28 And  it  came  to  pass  that  all 
they  who  loved  the  king,  when 
they heard these words, came forth 
and pursued after the servants of  
the king.

29 Now when the a servants of the 
king  saw  an  army  pursuing  after 
them, they were frightened again, 
and fled into the wilderness, and 
came  over  into  the  land  of  Zara-
hemla  and  joined  the  b people  of  
Ammon.

30 And the army which pursued 
after  them  returned,  having  pur-
sued after them in vain; and thus 
Amalickiah, by his  a fraud, gained 
the hearts of the people.

31 And it came to pass on the mor-
row he entered the city Nephi with 
his armies, and took possession of 
the city.
