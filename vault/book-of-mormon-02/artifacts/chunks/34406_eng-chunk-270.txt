23 And there was nothing save it 
was exceeding a harshness, b preach-
ing and prophesying of wars, and 
contentions, and destructions, and 
continually  c reminding  them  of 
death, and the duration of eternity, 
and the judgments and the power of 
God, and all these things—stirring 
them up d continually to keep them 
in the fear of the Lord. I say there 
was nothing short of these things, 
and exceedingly great plainness of 
speech, would keep them from go-
ing down speedily to destruction. 
And  after  this  manner  do  I  write 
concerning them.

24 And  I  saw  a wars  between  the 
Nephites  and  Lamanites  in  the 
course of my days.

25 And it came to pass that I be-
gan to be old, and an hundred and

seventy and nine years had passed 
away from the time that our father 
Lehi a left Jerusalem.

26 And  I  saw  that  I  a must  soon 
go down to my grave, having been 
wrought upon by the power of God 
that  I  must  preach  and  prophesy 
unto  this  people,  and  declare  the 
word according to the truth which 
is in Christ. And I have declared it 
in all my days, and have rejoiced 
in it above that of the world.

27 And I soon go to the place of my 
a rest, which is with my Redeemer; 
for I know that in him I shall b rest. 
And I rejoice in the day when my 
c mortal shall put on d immortality, 
and  shall  stand  before  him;  then 
shall I see his face with pleasure, 
and he will say unto me: Come unto 
me, ye blessed, there is a place pre-
pared for you in the e mansions of 
my Father. Amen.

The Book of JAroM

The  Nephites  keep  the  law  of  Moses, 
look forward to the coming of Christ, 
and prosper in the land—Many proph-
ets labor to keep the people in the way 
of truth. About 399–361 b.c.

NOW behold, I, Jarom, write

a  few  words  according  to 
the  commandment  of  my 
father,  Enos,  that  our  a genealogy 
may be kept.
