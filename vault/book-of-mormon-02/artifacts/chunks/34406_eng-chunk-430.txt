22 And now my beloved brethren, I 
have said these things unto you that 
I might awaken you to a sense of 
your duty to God, that ye may walk 
blameless before him, that ye may 
walk after the holy order of God,  
after which ye have been received.
23 And now I would that ye should 
be a humble, and be b submissive and 
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of 
patience  and  long-suffering;  be-
ing temperate in all things; being 
diligent in keeping the command-
ments  of  God  at  all  times;  asking 
for whatsoever things ye stand in 
need, both spiritual and temporal; 
always returning thanks unto God 
for whatsoever things ye do receive.
24 And  see  that  ye  have  a faith, 
hope, and charity, and then ye will 
always abound in good works.

25 And  may  the  Lord  bless  you, 
and  keep  your  garments  spotless, 
that ye may at last be brought to 
sit down with a Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, and the holy prophets who 
have been ever since the world be-
gan, having your garments b spotless 
even as their garments are spotless, 
in the kingdom of heaven to go no 
more out.

26 And now my beloved brethren, 
I  have  spoken  these  words  unto 
you according to the Spirit which 
testifieth in me; and my soul doth  
exceedingly rejoice, because of the 
exceeding diligence and heed which 
ye have given unto my word.

27 And now, may the a peace of God

rest upon you, and upon your houses 
and lands, and upon your flocks and 
herds, and all that you possess, your 
women and your children, accord-
ing to your faith and good works, 
from  this  time  forth  and  forever. 
And thus I have spoken. Amen.

CHAPTER 8

Alma  preaches  and  baptizes  in  Me-
lek—He  is  rejected  in  Ammonihah 
and leaves—An angel commands him 
to return and cry repentance unto the 
people—He is received by Amulek, and 
the two of them preach in Ammonihah. 
About 82 b.c.
And now it came to pass that Alma 
returned from the a land of Gideon, 
after having taught the people of 
Gideon many things which cannot 
be written, having established the 
b order of the church, according as 
he had before done in the land of 
Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his 
own  house  at  Zarahemla  to  rest 
himself from the labors which he 
had performed.
