in the last day it shall be b restored 
unto him according to his c deeds.

28 If  he  has  desired  to  do  a evil, 
and has not repented in his days, 
behold, evil shall be done unto him, 
according to the restoration of God.
29 And now, my son, I desire that 
ye should let these things a trouble 
you  no  more,  and  only  let  your 
sins trouble you, with that trouble 
which shall bring you down unto 
repentance.

30 O my son, I desire that ye should 
deny the a justice of God no more. Do 
not endeavor to excuse yourself in 
the least point because of your sins, 
by denying the justice of God; but 
do you let the justice of God, and 
his b mercy, and his long-suffering 
have full sway in your heart; and 
let  it  bring  you  down  to  the  dust 
in c humility.

31 And  now,  O  my  son,  ye  are 
called of God to a preach the word 
unto this people. And now, my son, 
go thy way, declare the word with 
truth and soberness, that thou may-
est  b bring  souls  unto  repentance, 
that the great plan of mercy may 
have  claim  upon  them.  And  may 
God grant unto you even according 
to my words. Amen.
