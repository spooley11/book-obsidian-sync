12 Behold, now I say unto you that 
he commandeth you to repent; and 
except ye repent, ye can in nowise 
inherit  the  kingdom  of  God.  But 
behold, this is not all—he has com-
manded you to repent, or he will 
utterly  a destroy  you  from  off  the 
face of the earth; yea, he will visit 
you in his b anger, and in his c fierce 
anger he will not turn away.

13 Behold, do ye not remember the 
words which he spake unto Lehi, say-
ing that: a Inasmuch as ye shall keep  
my commandments, ye shall pros-
per in the land? And again it is said 
that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep 
my commandments ye shall be cut 
off from the presence of the Lord.
14 Now  I  would  that  ye  should 
remember,  that  inasmuch  as  the 
Lamanites have not kept the com-
mandments of God, they have been 
a cut  off  from  the  presence  of  the 
Lord. Now we see that the word of 
the Lord has been verified in this 
thing, and the Lamanites have been 
cut off from his presence, from the 
beginning  of  their  transgressions 
in the land.

15 Nevertheless  I  say  unto  you, 
that it shall be more a tolerable for 
them in the day of judgment than 
for you, if ye remain in your sins,

yea,  and  even  more  tolerable  for 
them in this life than for you, ex-
cept ye repent.

16 For  there  are  many  promises 
which are a extended to the Laman-
ites; for it is because of the b tradi-
tions  of  their  fathers  that  caused 
them  to  remain  in  their  state  of 
c ignorance; therefore the Lord will 
be merciful unto them and d prolong 
their existence in the land.
