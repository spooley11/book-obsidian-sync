words,  they  withdrew  themselves 
from the multitude and came over 
into the land of a Jershon.

2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, 
after they had preached the word 
unto the a Zoramites, also came over 
into the land of Jershon.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
the more popular part of the Zor-
amites had consulted together con-
cerning the words which had been 
preached unto them, they were an-
gry because of the word, for it did 
destroy their a craft; therefore they 
would not hearken unto the words.
4 And  they  sent  and  gathered 
together  throughout  all  the  land 
all the people, and consulted with 
them concerning the words which 
had been spoken.

5 Now their rulers and their priests 
and their teachers did not let the 
people  know  concerning  their 
desires;  therefore  they  found  out 
privily the minds of all the people.
6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
they  had  found  out  the  minds  of 
all the people, those who were in 
favor of the words which had been 
spoken by Alma and his brethren 
were cast out of the land; and they 
were  a many;  and  they  came  over 
also into the land of Jershon.

7 And it came to pass that Alma 
and his brethren did minister unto 
them.

8 Now  the  people  of  the  Zoram-
ites were angry with the a people of 
Ammon who were in Jershon, and 
the  b chief  ruler  of  the  Zoramites, 
being a very wicked man, sent over 
unto the people of Ammon desiring 
them that they should cast out of 
their land all those who came over 
from them into their land.
