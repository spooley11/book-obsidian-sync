repentance  all  men  whosoever 
would hearken unto their words.

20 And thus they went forth, and 
the people did a humble themselves 
because of their b words, insomuch 
that  they  were  highly  c favored  of 
the Lord, and thus they were free 
from wars and contentions among 
themselves, yea, even for the space 
of four years.

21 But, as I have said, in the a latter 
end of the nineteenth year, yea, not-
withstanding their peace amongst 
themselves,  they  were  compelled 
reluctantly  to  contend  with  their 
brethren, the Lamanites.

22 Yea,  and  in  fine,  their  wars 
never  did  cease  for  the  space  of 
many  years  with  the  Lamanites, 
notwithstanding  their  much  re-
luctance.

23 Now, they were  a sorry to take 
up arms against the Lamanites, be-
cause  they  did  not  delight  in  the 
shedding  of  blood;  yea,  and  this 
was  not  all—they  were  b sorry  to 
be the means of sending so many 
of their brethren out of this world 
into an eternal world, c unprepared 
to meet their God.

24 Nevertheless,  they  could  not 
suffer to lay down their lives, that 
their  a wives  and  their  children 
should be  b massacred by the bar-
barous c cruelty of those who were 
once their brethren, yea, and had 
d dissented from their church, and 
had left them and had gone to de-
stroy them by joining the Lamanites.
25 Yea,  they  could  not  bear  that 
their brethren should rejoice over 
the blood of the Nephites, so long 
as there were any who should keep 
the commandments of God, for the 
promise  of  the  Lord  was,  if  they 
should  keep  his  commandments 
they should a prosper in the land.
