4 And if their works are evil they 
shall be a restored unto them for evil. 
Therefore,  all  things  shall  be  b re-
stored to their proper order, every 
thing to its natural frame—c mortality 
raised to d immortality, e corruption 
to incorruption—raised to f endless  
happiness to g inherit the kingdom 
of God, or to endless misery to in-
herit the kingdom of the devil, the 
one on one hand, the other on the 
other—

5 The one raised to a happiness ac-
cording to his desires of happiness, 
or good according to his desires of 
good; and the other to evil according 
to his desires of evil; for as he has 
desired to do evil all the day long 
even so shall he have his reward of 
evil when the night cometh.

6 And so it is on the other hand. 
If he hath repented of his sins, and 
desired righteousness until the end 
of his days, even so he shall be re-
warded unto righteousness.

7 a These are they that are redeemed 
of the Lord; yea, these are they that 
are taken out, that are delivered from

that endless night of darkness; and 
thus they stand or fall; for behold, 
they are their own b judges, whether 
to do good or do evil.

8 Now,  the  decrees  of  God  are 
a unalterable; therefore, the way is 
prepared that b whosoever will may 
c walk therein and be saved.

9 And now behold, my son, do not 
risk a one more offense against your 
God upon those points of doctrine, 
which  ye  have  hitherto  risked  to 
commit sin.

10 Do not suppose, because it has 
been spoken concerning restoration, 
that ye shall be restored from sin to 
happiness. Behold, I say unto you, 
a wickedness never was b happiness.
11 And now, my son, all men that 
are in a state of a nature, or I would 
say, in a b carnal state, are in the c gall 
of bitterness and in the d bonds of 
iniquity; they are e without God in 
the world, and they have gone f con-
trary to the nature of God; there-
fore, they are in a state contrary to 
the nature of happiness.
