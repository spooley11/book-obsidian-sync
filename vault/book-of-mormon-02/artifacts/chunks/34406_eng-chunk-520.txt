house  to  house,  relying  upon  the 
mercies  of  the  world—not  upon 
the mercies of the world alone but 
upon the mercies of God.

29 And we have entered into their 
houses  and  taught  them,  and  we 
have taught them in their streets; 
yea, and we have taught them upon 
their hills; and we have also entered 
into their temples and their a syna-

of their love towards their brethren 
and also towards us.
