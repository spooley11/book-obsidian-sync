20 In the same day shall the Lord 
shave  with  a  a razor  that  is  hired, 
by them beyond the river, by the 
king of Assyria, the head, and the 
hair  of  the  feet;  and  it  shall  also 
consume the beard.

21 And it shall come to pass in that 
day, a man shall nourish a young 
cow and two sheep;

22 And it shall come to pass, for 
the abundance of milk they shall 
give he shall eat butter; for butter 
and honey shall every one eat that 
is left in the land.

23 And  it  shall  come  to  pass  in 
that day, every place shall be, where 
there  were  a  thousand  vines  at  a 
thousand  silverlings,  which  shall 
be for briers and thorns.

24 With  arrows  and  with  bows 
shall  men  come  thither,  because 
all  the  land  shall  become  briers 
and thorns.

25 And all hills that shall be digged 
with  the  mattock,  there  shall  not 
come thither the fear of briers and 
thorns; but it shall be for the send-
ing forth of oxen, and the treading 
of lesser cattle.

CHAPTER 18

Christ will be as a stone of stumbling 
and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, 
not peeping wizards—Turn to the law 
and  to  the  testimony  for  guidance—
Compare Isaiah 8. About 559–545 b.c.

9  a Associate  yourselves,  O  ye  
people, and ye shall be broken in 
pieces;  and  give  ear  all  ye  of  far 
countries; gird yourselves, and ye 
shall be broken in pieces; gird your-
selves,  and  ye  shall  be  broken  in  
pieces.
