7 And it came to pass that those 
rulers  who  were  the  remnant  of 
the  children  of  a Amulon  caused 
that they should be put to b death, 
yea, all those that believed in these  
things.

8 Now this martyrdom caused that 
many of their brethren should be 
stirred up to anger; and there began 
to be contention in the wilderness; 
and the Lamanites began to a hunt 
the seed of Amulon and his breth-
ren  and  began  to  slay  them;  and 
they fled into the east wilderness.
9 And behold they are hunted at 
this  day  by  the  Lamanites.  Thus 
the words of Abinadi were brought 
to pass, which he said concerning 
the seed of the priests who caused 
that he should suffer death by fire.
10 For he said unto them: What ye 
shall  a do unto me shall be a type 
of things to come.

11 And now Abinadi was the first 
that suffered a death by fire because 
of  his  belief  in  God;  now  this  is 
what he meant, that many should 
suffer death by fire, according as 
he had suffered.

12 And he said unto the priests of 
Noah that their seed should cause 
many  to  be  put  to  death,  in  the 
like  manner  as  he  was,  and  that 
they  should  be  scattered  abroad 
and slain, even as a sheep having 
no shepherd is driven and slain by 
wild beasts; and now behold, these 
words were verified, for they were 
driven by the Lamanites, and they 
were hunted, and they were smitten.
13 And it came to pass that when
