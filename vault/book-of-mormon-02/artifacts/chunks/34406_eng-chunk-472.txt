7 And it came to pass that Zoram 
and his sons crossed over the river Si-
don, with their armies, and marched 
away beyond the borders of Manti 
into the south wilderness, which was 
on the east side of the river Sidon.
8 And they came upon the armies 
of the Lamanites, and the Laman-
ites were scattered and driven into 
the wilderness; and they took their 
brethren who had been taken cap-
tive by the Lamanites, and there was 
not one soul of them had been lost 
that were taken captive. And they 
were brought by their brethren to 
possess their own lands.

9 And  thus  ended  the  eleventh 
year of the judges, the Lamanites 
having been driven out of the land, 
and the people of Ammonihah were 
a destroyed; yea, b every living soul

of  the  Ammonihahites  was  c de-
stroyed, and also their d great city, 
which they said God could not de-
stroy, because of its greatness.

10 But behold, in a one day it was 
left desolate; and the b carcasses were 
mangled by dogs and wild beasts 
of the wilderness.

11 Nevertheless, after many days 
their  a dead  bodies  were  heaped 
up upon the face of the earth, and 
they were covered with a shallow 
covering.  And  now  so  great  was 
the  scent  thereof  that  the  people 
did not go in to possess the land of 
Ammonihah for many years. And 
it was called Desolation of b Nehors; 
for they were of the profession of 
Nehor,  who  were  slain;  and  their 
lands remained desolate.

12 And the Lamanites did not come 
again to war against the Nephites 
until  the  fourteenth  year  of  the 
reign of the judges over the people 
of Nephi. And thus for three years 
did the people of Nephi have con-
tinual peace in all the land.

13 And  Alma  and  Amulek  went 
forth preaching repentance to the 
people  in  their  a temples,  and  in 
their b sanctuaries, and also in their 
c synagogues, which were built after 
the manner of the Jews.
