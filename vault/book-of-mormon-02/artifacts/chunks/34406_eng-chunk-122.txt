27 Wherefore,  men  are  a free  ac-
cording to the b flesh; and c all things 
are d given them which are expedi-
ent unto man. And they are free to 
e choose  f  liberty  and  eternal  g life, 
through  the  great  Mediator  of  all 
men,  or  to  choose  captivity  and 
death, according to the captivity and 
power of the devil; for he seeketh 
that  all  men  might  be  h miserable 
like unto himself.

28 And  now,  my  sons,  I  would  
that  ye  should  look  to  the  great  
a Mediator,  and  hearken  unto  his 
great commandments; and be faith-
ful unto his words, and choose eter-
nal life, according to the will of his 
Holy Spirit;

29 And not choose eternal death, 
according  to  the  will  of  the  flesh 
and the a evil which is therein, which 
giveth the spirit of the devil power 
to b captivate, to bring you down to 
c hell, that he may reign over you in 
his own kingdom.

unto  you  all,  my  sons,  in  the  last 
days of my probation; and I have
