16 And  now,  O  Lord,  wilt  thou 
turn  away  thine  anger,  and  try 
again if they will serve thee? And 
if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them 
according to thy words which thou 
hast said.

17 And it came to pass that in the 
seventy and sixth year the Lord did 
turn away his anger from the peo-
ple,  and  caused  that  a rain  should 
fall upon the earth, insomuch that 
it did bring forth her fruit in the 
season of her fruit. And it came to 
pass that it did bring forth her grain 
in the season of her grain.

18 And behold, the people did re-
joice and glorify God, and the whole 
face of the land was filled with re-
joicing; and they did no more seek to 
destroy Nephi, but they did esteem 
him as a a great prophet, and a man 
of God, having great power and au-
thority given unto him from God.
19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, 
was not a  a whit behind him as to 
things pertaining to righteousness.
20 And  thus  it  did  come  to  pass 
that the people of Nephi began to 
prosper again in the land, and be-
gan to build up their waste places, 
and began to multiply and spread, 
even until they did a cover the whole 
face of the land, both on the north-
ward and on the southward, from 
the sea west to the sea east.

21 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
seventy and sixth year did end in 
peace. And the seventy and seventh  
year began in peace; and the a church 
did spread throughout the face of all 
the land; and the more part of the 
people, both the Nephites and the  
Lamanites, did belong to the church; 
and they did have exceedingly great 
peace in the land; and thus ended 
the seventy and seventh year.

22 And also they had peace in the

seventy and eighth year, save it were 
a few contentions concerning the 
points of doctrine which had been 
laid down by the prophets.
