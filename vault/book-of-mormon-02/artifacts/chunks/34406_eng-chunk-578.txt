6 For behold, if ye a deny the Holy 
Ghost when it once has had place 
in you, and ye know that ye deny 
it,  behold,  this  is  a  sin  which  is 
b unpardonable; yea, and whosoever 
murdereth  against  the  light  and 
knowledge of God, it is not easy for 
him  to  obtain  c forgiveness;  yea,  I 
say unto you, my son, that it is not 
easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.
7 And now, my son, I would to God 
that ye had not been a guilty of so 
great  a  crime.  I  would  not  dwell 
upon  your  crimes,  to  harrow  up 
your  soul,  if  it  were  not  for  your  
good.

8 But behold, ye cannot a hide your 
crimes from God; and except ye re-
pent they will stand as a testimony 
against you at the last day.

9 Now  my  son,  I  would  that  ye

should repent and forsake your sins, 
and go no more after the a lusts of 
your eyes, but b cross yourself in all 
these things; for except ye do this ye 
can in nowise inherit the kingdom 
of God. Oh, remember, and take it 
upon  you,  and  c cross  yourself  in 
these things.

10 And I command you to take it 
upon you to counsel with your elder 
brothers in your undertakings; for 
behold, thou art in thy youth, and 
ye stand in need to be nourished 
by your brothers. And give heed to 
their counsel.

11 Suffer  not  yourself  to  be  led 
away by any vain or foolish thing; 
suffer  not  the  devil  to  lead  away 
your heart again after those wicked 
harlots.  Behold,  O  my  son,  how 
great a iniquity ye brought upon the 
b Zoramites; for when they saw your 
c conduct they would not believe in  
my words.

12 And now the Spirit of the Lord 
doth say unto me: a Command thy 
children to do good, lest they b lead 
away the hearts of many people to 
destruction; therefore I command 
you, my son, in the fear of God, that 
ye c refrain from your iniquities;

13 That ye turn to the Lord with 
all your mind, might, and strength; 
that ye lead away the hearts of no 
more to do wickedly; but rather re-
turn unto them, and a acknowledge 
your faults and that wrong which 
ye have done.
