24 For behold, they are more righ-
teous than you, for they have not 
sinned against that great knowledge 
which ye have received; therefore 
the Lord will be merciful unto them; 
yea, he will a lengthen out their days 
and increase their seed, even when 
thou shalt be utterly b destroyed ex-
cept thou shalt repent.

25 Yea,  wo  be  unto  you  because 
of  that  great  abomination  which 
has come among you; and ye have 
united  yourselves  unto  it,  yea,  to 
that a secret band which was estab-
lished by Gadianton!

26 Yea,  a wo shall come unto you 
because of that pride which ye have 
suffered to enter your hearts, which 
has lifted you up beyond that which 
is good because of your exceedingly 
great riches!

27 Yea, wo be unto you because of 
your wickedness and abominations!
28 And except ye repent ye shall 
perish; yea, even your lands shall 
be taken from you, and ye shall be 
destroyed from off the face of the  
earth.

29 Behold now, I do not say that

these  things  shall  be,  of  myself, 
because  it  is  not  of  myself  that  
I a know these things; but behold, I  
b know that these things are true be-
cause the Lord God has made them 
known unto me, therefore I testify 
that they shall be.

CHAPTER 8

Corrupt judges seek to incite the peo-
ple against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, 
Zenos,  Zenock,  Ezias,  Isaiah,  Jere-
miah,  Lehi,  and  Nephi  all  testified 
of  Christ—By  inspiration  Nephi  an-
nounces the murder of the chief judge. 
About 23–21 b.c.
And now it came to pass that when 
Nephi had said these words, behold, 
there were men who were judges, 
who  also  belonged  to  the  secret 
band of Gadianton, and they were 
angry, and they cried out against 
him, saying unto the people: Why 
do ye not seize upon this man and 
bring  him  forth,  that  he  may  be 
condemned according to the crime 
which he has done?

2 Why  seest  thou  this  man,  and 
hearest him revile against this peo-
ple and against our law?

3 For  behold,  Nephi  had  spoken 
unto them concerning the corrupt-
ness of their law; yea, many things 
did Nephi speak which cannot be 
written; and nothing did he speak 
which  was  contrary  to  the  com-
mandments of God.
