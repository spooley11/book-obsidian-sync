MOSIAH 12  : 12–29

of the field, which is run over by 
the beasts and trodden under foot.
12 And again, he saith thou shalt 
be  as  the  blossoms  of  a  thistle, 
which, when it is fully ripe, if the 
wind  bloweth,  it  is  driven  forth 
upon the face of the land. And he 
pretendeth  the  Lord  hath  spoken 
it. And he saith all this shall come 
upon thee except thou repent, and 
this because of thine iniquities.

13 And  now,  O  king,  what  great 
evil hast thou done, or what great 
sins  have  thy  people  committed, 
that we should be  a condemned of 
God or judged of this man?

14 And  now,  O  king,  behold,  we 
are a guiltless, and thou, O king, hast 
not sinned; therefore, this man has 
b lied  concerning  you,  and  he  has 
prophesied in vain.

15 And behold, we are strong, we 
shall not come into bondage, or be 
taken captive by our enemies; yea, 
and  thou  hast  prospered  in  the  
land, and thou shalt also prosper.
16 Behold, here is the man, we de-
liver him into thy hands; thou mayest  
do with him as seemeth thee good.
17 And it came to pass that king 
Noah caused that Abinadi should 
be  cast  into  prison;  and  he  com-
manded  that  the  a priests  should 
gather  themselves  together  that 
he might hold a council with them 
what he should do with him.

18 And it came to pass that they 
said unto the king: Bring him hither 
that we may question him; and the 
king commanded that he should be 
brought before them.
