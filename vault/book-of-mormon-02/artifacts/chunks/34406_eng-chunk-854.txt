4 And  the  Lord  said  unto  them: 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, why 
is it that the people should murmur 
and dispute because of this thing?
5 Have they not read the scriptures, 
which say ye must take upon you 
the  a name  of  Christ,  which  is  my 
name? For by this name shall ye be 
called at the last day;

6 And whoso taketh upon him my 
name, and a endureth to the end, the 
same shall be saved at the last day.
7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall 
do, ye shall do it in my name; there-
fore ye shall call the church in my 
name;  and  ye  shall  call  upon  the 
Father in my name that he will bless  
the church for my sake.

8 And how be it a my b church save 
it be called in my name? For if a 
church be called in Moses’ name then 
it be Moses’ church; or if it be called 
in the name of a man then it be the  
church of a man; but if it be called 
in my name then it is my church, 
if it so be that they are built upon 
my gospel.

9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are 
built upon my gospel; therefore ye 
shall call whatsoever things ye do 
call, in my name; therefore if ye call 
upon the Father, for the church, if 
it be in my name the Father will 
hear you;
