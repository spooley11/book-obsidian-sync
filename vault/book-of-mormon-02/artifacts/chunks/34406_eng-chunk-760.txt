2 And  a Nephi,  the  son  of  Hela-
man, had departed out of the land 
of  Zarahemla,  giving  charge  unto 
his son b Nephi, who was his eldest 
son, concerning the c plates of brass, 
and d all the records which had been 
kept,  and  all  those  things  which 
had been kept sacred from the de-
parture of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

3 Then  he  a departed  out  of  the 
land, and b whither he went, no man 
knoweth;  and  his  son  Nephi  did 
keep the records in his stead, yea,

Samuel the prophet.

10 Now it came to pass that when 
Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this 
wickedness of his people, his heart 
was exceedingly sorrowful.

11 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
went out and bowed himself down
