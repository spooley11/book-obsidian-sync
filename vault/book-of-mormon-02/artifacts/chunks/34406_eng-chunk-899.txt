27 And it shall come in a day when 
the a blood of saints shall cry unto 
the Lord, because of secret b combi-
nations and the works of darkness.
28 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
the power of God shall be a denied, 
and b churches become defiled and 
be  c lifted up in the pride of their 
hearts; yea, even in a day when lead-
ers of churches and teachers shall 
rise  in  the  pride  of  their  hearts, 
even to the envying of them who 
belong to their churches.

29 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
a there shall be heard of fires, and 
tempests, and b vapors of smoke in 
foreign lands;

30 And there shall also be heard 
of a wars, rumors of wars, and earth-
quakes in divers places.

31 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
there shall be great a pollutions upon 
the face of the earth; there shall be 
b murders, and robbing, and lying,

and deceivings, and whoredoms, and 
all manner of abominations; when 
there shall be many who will say, 
Do this, or do that, and it c mattereth  
not, for the Lord will d uphold such 
at the last day. But wo unto such, 
for they are in the  e gall of bitter-
ness and in the f  bonds of iniquity.
32 Yea, it shall come in a day when 
there  shall  be  a churches  built  up 
that shall say: Come unto me, and 
for  your  money  you  shall  be  for-
given of your sins.

33 O ye wicked and perverse and 
a stiffnecked  people,  why  have  ye 
built up churches unto yourselves 
to get  b gain? Why have ye  c trans-
figured the holy word of God, that 
ye  might  bring  d damnation  upon 
your  souls?  Behold,  look  ye  unto 
the e revelations of God; for behold, 
the time cometh at that day when 
all these things must be fulfilled.

34 Behold,  the  Lord  hath  shown 
unto me great and marvelous things 
concerning that which must shortly 
come, at that day when these things 
shall come forth among you.

35 Behold, I speak unto you as if  
ye were present, and yet ye are not.  
But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown 
you  unto  me,  and  I  know  your  
doing.
