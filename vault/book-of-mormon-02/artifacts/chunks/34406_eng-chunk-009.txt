“Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, 
stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the 
neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under 
a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This 
stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thin-
ner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the 
ground, but the edge all around was covered with earth.

“Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under 
the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, 
and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and

the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay 
was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bot-
tom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on these 
stones lay the plates and the other things with them.

“I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messen-
ger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had 
not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he 
told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that 
time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue 
to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.

“Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, 
and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruc-
tion and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what 
the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was 
to be conducted in the last days. . . .
