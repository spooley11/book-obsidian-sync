13 O remember, remember, my son 
Helaman, how a strict are the com-
mandments of God. And he said: b If 
ye will keep my commandments ye 
shall  c prosper  in  the  land—but  if 
ye keep not his commandments ye 
shall be cut off from his presence.
14 And  now  remember,  my  son, 
that God has  a entrusted you with 
these  things,  which  are  b sacred, 
which he has kept sacred, and also 
which he will keep and  c preserve 
for a d wise purpose in him, that he

may show forth his power unto fu-
ture generations.

15 And now behold, I tell you by 
the  spirit  of  prophecy,  that  if  ye 
transgress  the  commandments  of 
God,  behold,  these  things  which 
are sacred shall be taken away from 
you  by  the  power  of  God,  and  ye 
shall  be  delivered  up  unto  Satan, 
that he may sift you as chaff before  
the wind.

16 But if ye keep the command-
ments  of  God,  and  do  with  these 
things which are sacred according 
to that which the Lord doth com-
mand  you,  (for  you  must  appeal 
unto the Lord for all things whatso-
ever ye must do with them) behold, 
no power of earth or hell can a take 
them from you, for God is powerful 
to the fulfilling of all his words.

17 For he will fulfil all his a prom-
ises which he shall make unto you, 
for  he  has  fulfilled  his  promises 
which he has made unto our fathers.
18 For he promised unto them that 
he  would  a preserve  these  things 
for a wise purpose in him, that he 
might  show  forth  his  power  unto 
future generations.

19 And now behold, one purpose 
hath he fulfilled, even to the res-
toration of a many thousands of the  
Lamanites  to  the  knowledge  of  
the truth; and he hath shown forth 
his power in them, and he will also 
still show forth his power in them 
unto b future generations; therefore 
they shall be preserved.

20 Therefore I command you, my 
son Helaman, that ye be diligent in  
fulfilling all my words, and that ye  
be diligent in keeping the command-
ments of God as they are written.

21 And  now,  I  will  speak  unto
