HELAMAN 16  : 1–15

And now, it came to pass that there 
were  many  who  heard  the  words 
of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he 
spake upon the  a walls of the city. 
And as many as believed on his word 
went  forth  and  sought  for  Nephi; 
and when they had come forth and 
found him they confessed unto him 
their sins and denied not, desiring 
that they might be b baptized unto 
the Lord.

2 But as many as there were who 
did not believe in the words of Sam-
uel were a angry with him; and they 
cast stones at him upon the wall, 
and also many shot arrows at him 
as he stood upon the wall; but the 
Spirit  of  the  Lord  was  with  him, 
insomuch  that  they  could  not  hit 
him with their stones neither with 
their arrows.

3 Now  when  they  saw  that  they 
could not hit him, there were many 
more who did believe on his words, 
insomuch that they went away unto 
Nephi to be baptized.

4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, 
and  prophesying,  and  preaching, 
crying repentance unto the people, 
showing signs and wonders, working 
a miracles  among  the  people,  that 
they  might  know  that  the  Christ 
must b shortly come—
