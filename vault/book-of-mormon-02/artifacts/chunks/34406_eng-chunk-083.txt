30 And  notwithstanding  they  
being led, the Lord their God, their 
Redeemer, going before them, a lead-
ing them by day and giving light 
unto them by night, and doing all 
things for them which were b expe-
dient for man to receive, they hard-
ened their hearts and blinded their 
minds, and c reviled against Moses 
and against the true and living God.
31 And  it  came  to  pass  that  ac-
cording to his word he did a destroy 
them; and according to his word he 
did b lead them; and according to his 
word he did do all things for them; 
and there was not any thing done 
save it were by his word.

32 And  after  they  had  crossed 
the river Jordan he did make them 
mighty unto the a driving out of the 
children of the land, yea, unto the 
scattering them to destruction.

33 And  now,  do  ye  suppose  that 
the children of this land, who were 
in the land of promise, who were 
driven  out  by  our  fathers,  do  ye 
suppose that they were righteous? 
Behold, I say unto you, Nay.

34 Do ye suppose that our fathers 
would have been more choice than 
they if they had been righteous? I 
say unto you, Nay.

35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all 
a flesh in one; he that is b righteous 
is c favored of God. But behold, this

d people had rejected every word of 
God, and they were ripe in iniquity; 
and  the  fulness  of  the  wrath  of 
God was upon them; and the Lord 
did  curse  the  land  against  them, 
and bless it unto our fathers; yea, 
he did curse it against them unto 
their destruction, and he did bless 
it unto our fathers unto their ob-
taining power over it.

36 Behold, the Lord hath created 
the a earth that it should be b inhab-
ited; and he hath created his chil-
dren that they should possess it.

37 And he a raiseth up a righteous 
nation, and destroyeth the nations 
of the wicked.

38 And he leadeth away the righ-
teous into precious a lands, and the 
wicked he b destroyeth, and curseth 
the land unto them for their sakes.
39 He ruleth high in the heavens, 
for it is his throne, and this earth 
is his a footstool.
