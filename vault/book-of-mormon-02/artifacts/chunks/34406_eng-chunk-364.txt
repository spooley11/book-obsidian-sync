And now it came to pass that Am-
mon  and  king  Limhi  began  to 
consult with the people how they 
should  a deliver  themselves  out  of 
bondage; and even they did cause 
that  all  the  people  should  gather 
themselves together; and this they 
did that they might have the voice 
of the people concerning the matter.
2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
could find no way to deliver them-
selves out of bondage, except it were 
to take their women and children, 
and  their  flocks,  and  their  herds, 
and their tents, and depart into the 
wilderness; for the Lamanites being 
so numerous, it was impossible for 
the people of Limhi to contend with 
them, thinking to deliver themselves 
out of bondage by the sword.

3 Now it came to pass that a Gideon 
went  forth  and  stood  before  the 
king,  and  said  unto  him:  Now  O 
king, thou hast hitherto hearkened 
unto my words many times when 
we have been contending with our 
brethren, the Lamanites.

4 And  now  O  king,  if  thou  hast 
not found me to be an unprofitable 
servant, or if thou hast hitherto lis-
tened to my words in any degree, 
and  they  have  been  of  service  to 
thee,  even  so  I  desire  that  thou 
wouldst listen to my words at this 
time, and I will be thy servant and 
deliver this people out of bondage.
5 And the king granted unto him 
that he might speak. And Gideon 
said unto him:

the  back  wall,  on  the  back  side 
of the city. The Lamanites, or the
