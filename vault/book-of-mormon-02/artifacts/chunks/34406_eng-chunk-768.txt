selves up unto us, and unite with 
us  and  become  acquainted  with 
our a secret works, and become our 
brethren that ye may be like unto 
us—not our slaves, but our brethren 
and partners of all our substance.
8 And behold, I a swear unto you, 
if ye will do this, with an oath, ye 
shall not be destroyed; but if ye will 
not do this, I swear unto you with 
an oath, that on the morrow month I 
will command that my armies shall 
come down against you, and they 
shall not stay their hand and shall 
spare not, but shall slay you, and 
shall  let  fall  the  sword  upon  you 
even until ye shall become extinct.
9 And  behold,  I  am  a Giddianhi; 
and I am the governor of this the 
b secret society of Gadianton; which 
society  and  the  works  thereof  I 
know to be c good; and they are of 
d ancient date and they have been 
handed down unto us.

10 And  I  write  this  epistle  unto 
you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye 
will deliver up your lands and your 
possessions, without the shedding 
of blood, that this my people may 
recover  their  rights  and  a govern-
ment,  who  have  dissented  away 
from you because of your wicked-
ness in retaining from them their 
rights of government, and except ye 
do this, I will avenge their wrongs. 
I am Giddianhi.

11 And now it came to pass when 
Lachoneus received this epistle he 
was  exceedingly  astonished,  be-
cause of the boldness of Giddianhi 
demanding  the  possession  of  the 
land  of  the  Nephites,  and  also  of 
threatening the people and aveng-
ing  the  wrongs  of  those  that  had 
received  no  wrong,  save  it  were 
they had  a wronged themselves by 
dissenting away unto those wicked 
and abominable robbers.
