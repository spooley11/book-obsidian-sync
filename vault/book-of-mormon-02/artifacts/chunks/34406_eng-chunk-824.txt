CHAPTER 18

Jesus institutes the sacrament among 
the Nephites—They are commanded to 
pray always in His name—Those who 
eat His flesh and drink His blood un-
worthily are damned—The disciples are 
given power to confer the Holy Ghost. 
About a.d. 34.
And it came to pass that Jesus com-
manded  his  disciples  that  they 
should bring forth some a bread and 
wine unto him.

2 And  while  they  were  gone  for 
bread  and  wine,  he  commanded 
the multitude that they should sit 
themselves down upon the earth.

3 And when the disciples had come 
with  a bread and wine, he took of 
the bread and brake and blessed it; 
and he gave unto the disciples and 
commanded that they should eat.

4 And when they had eaten and 
were  filled,  he  commanded  that 
they should give unto the multitude.
5 And  when  the  multitude  had 
eaten and were filled, he said unto 
the disciples: Behold there shall one 
be  a ordained  among  you,  and  to 
him will I give power that he shall 
b break c bread and bless it and give 
it unto the people of my  d church, 
unto all those who shall believe and 
be baptized in my name.

6 And this shall ye always observe 
to a do, even as I have done, even as 
I have broken bread and blessed it 
and given it unto you.

7 And this shall ye do in a remem-
brance of my b body, which I have 
shown  unto  you.  And  it  shall  be 
a  testimony  unto  the  Father  that  
ye do always remember me. And if ye  
do  always  remember  me  ye  shall 
have my Spirit to be with you.

8 And it came to pass that when

he said these words, he commanded 
his disciples that they should take 
of the a wine of the cup and drink 
of it, and that they should also give 
unto the multitude that they might 
drink of it.
