and  immovable  in  keeping  the 
commandments of God, and they 
bore with b patience the persecution 
which was heaped upon them.

26 And when the priests left their 
a labor to impart the word of God 
unto the people, the people also left 
their labors to hear the word of God. 
And when the priest had imparted 
unto  them  the  word  of  God  they 
all returned again diligently unto 
their labors; and the priest, not es-
teeming himself above his hearers, 
for the preacher was no better than 
the hearer, neither was the teacher 
any  better  than  the  learner;  and 
thus they were all equal, and they 
did all labor, every man b according 
to his strength.

27 And they did a impart of their 
substance,  every  man  according 
to that which he had, to the b poor, 
and  the  needy,  and  the  sick,  and 
the afflicted; and they did not wear 
costly c apparel, yet they were neat 
and comely.

28 And  thus  they  did  establish 
the affairs of the church; and thus 
they began to have continual peace 
again,  notwithstanding  all  their 
persecutions.

29 And now, because of the steadi-
ness  of  the  church  they  began  to 
be exceedingly a rich, having abun-
dance  of  all  things  whatsoever  
they stood in need—an abundance 
of flocks and herds, and fatlings of  
every kind, and also abundance of 
grain, and of gold, and of silver, and 
of precious things, and abundance  
of b silk and fine-twined linen, and 
all manner of good homely c cloth.
30 And thus, in their a prosperous

circumstances,  they  did  not  send 
away any who were b naked, or that 
were hungry, or that were athirst, 
or that were sick, or that had not 
been nourished; and they did not 
set their hearts upon c riches; there-
fore they were d liberal to all, both 
old and young, both bond and free, 
both  male  and  female,  whether 
out of the church or in the church, 
having no e respect to persons as to 
those who stood in need.
