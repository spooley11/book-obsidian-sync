11 And again I say unto you as I 
have  said  before,  that  as  ye  have 
come to the knowledge of the glory 
of God, or if ye have known of his 
goodness  and  have  a tasted  of  his 
love,  and  have  received  a  b remis-
sion  of  your  sins,  which  causeth 
such exceedingly great joy in your 
souls, even so I would that ye should 
remember, and always retain in re-
membrance, the greatness of God, 
and  your  own  c nothingness,  and 
his  d goodness  and  long-suffering 
towards you, unworthy creatures, 
and humble yourselves even in the 
depths of e humility, f calling on the 
name of the Lord daily, and stand-
ing g steadfastly in the faith of that 
which is to come, which was spoken 
by the mouth of the angel.

12 And behold, I say unto you that 
if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, 
and be filled with the a love of God, 
and always  b retain a remission of 
your sins; and ye shall grow in the 
c knowledge of the glory of him that 
created you, or in the knowledge of 
that which is just and true.

13 And ye will not have a a mind 
to  injure  one  another,  but  to  live 
b peaceably, and to render to every
