16 And it came to pass that Alma 
and Amulek, Amulek having a for-
saken all his gold, and silver, and 
his precious things, which were in 
the  land  of  Ammonihah,  for  the 
word of God, he being b rejected by 
those who were once his friends and 
also by his father and his kindred;
17 Therefore,  after  Alma  having 
established  the  church  at  Sidom, 
seeing  a  great  a check,  yea,  seeing 
that the people were checked as to 
the pride of their hearts, and began 
to b humble themselves before God, 
and began to assemble themselves 
together at their c sanctuaries to d wor-
ship God before the e altar, f watching 
and praying continually, that they 
might be delivered from Satan, and 
from g death, and from destruction—

18 Now  as  I  said,  Alma  having 
seen all these things, therefore he 
took Amulek and came over to the 
land  of  Zarahemla,  and  took  him 
to his a own house, and did admin-
ister unto him in his tribulations, 
and b strengthened him in the Lord.
19 And thus ended the tenth year 
of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi.
