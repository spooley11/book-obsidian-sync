16 And now it came to pass that 
the judges did expound the matter 
unto  the  people,  and  did  cry  out 
against Nephi, saying: Behold, we 
know  that  this  Nephi  must  have 
agreed  with  some  one  to  slay  the 
judge, and then he might declare 
it unto us, that he might convert us 
unto his faith, that he might raise 
himself to be a great man, chosen 
of God, and a prophet.

17 And now behold, we will detect 
this man, and he shall confess his 
fault and make known unto us the 
true murderer of this judge.

18 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
five  were  liberated  on  the  day  of 
the burial. Nevertheless, they did 
rebuke  the  judges  in  the  words 
which  they  had  spoken  against 
Nephi, and did contend with them 
one by one, insomuch that they did 
confound them.

19 Nevertheless, they caused that 
Nephi should be taken and bound 
and brought before the multitude, 
and they began to question him in 
divers ways that they might cross 
him,  that  they  might  accuse  him 
to death—

20 Saying unto him: Thou art con-
federate; who is this man that hath 
done this murder? Now tell us, and 
acknowledge thy fault; saying, Be-
hold  here  is  a money;  and  also  we 
will grant unto thee thy life if thou 
wilt  tell  us,  and  acknowledge  the 
agreement which thou hast made 
with him.

21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye

a fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye 
blind, and ye b stiffnecked people, 
do ye know how long the Lord your 
God will suffer you that ye shall go 
on in this your way of sin?

22 O  ye  ought  to  begin  to  howl 
and  a mourn, because of the great 
destruction which at this time doth 
await you, except ye shall repent.

23 Behold ye say that I have agreed 
with a man that he should murder 
Seezoram, our chief judge. But be-
hold,  I  say  unto  you,  that  this  is 
because  I  have  testified  unto  you 
that ye might know concerning this 
thing; yea, even for a witness unto 
you, that I did know of the wicked-
ness and abominations which are 
among you.
