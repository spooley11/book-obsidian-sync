Many  false  churches  will  be  built  up 
in the last days—They will teach false, 
vain, and foolish doctrines—Apostasy 
will  abound  because  of  false  teach-
ers—The devil will rage in the hearts 
of men—He will teach all manner of 
false doctrines. About 559–545 b.c.

2 NEPHI 28  : 2–13

as the Spirit hath constrained me; 
wherefore, I know that they must 
surely come to pass.

2 And the things which shall be 
written out of the a book shall be of 
great  b worth unto the children of 
men, and especially unto our seed, 
which  is  a  c remnant  of  the  house 
of Israel.

3 For it shall come to pass in that 
day that the a churches which are built 
up, and not unto the Lord, when the 
one shall say unto the other: Behold, 
I, I am the Lord’s; and the others shall 
say: I, I am the Lord’s; and thus shall 
every  one  say  that  hath  built  up 
b churches, and not unto the Lord—
4 And they shall contend one with 
another; and their priests shall con-
tend  one  with  another,  and  they 
shall  teach  with  their  a learning, 
and  deny  the  b Holy  Ghost,  which 
giveth utterance.
