18 And  who  shall  say  that  Jesus 
Christ  did  not  do  many  mighty 
a miracles?  And  there  were  many 
b mighty  miracles  wrought  by  the 
hands of the apostles.

19 And  if  there  were  a miracles 
wrought then, why has God ceased 
to be a God of miracles and yet be 
an  unchangeable  Being?  And  be-
hold, I say unto you he b changeth 
not; if so he would cease to be God; 
and he ceaseth not to be God, and 
is a God of miracles.

20 And the reason why he ceaseth 
to do a miracles among the children 
of men is because that they dwindle 
in  unbelief,  and  depart  from  the 
right way, and know not the God 
in whom they should b trust.

21 Behold,  I  say  unto  you  that 
whoso believeth in Christ, doubting 
nothing,  a whatsoever he shall ask 
the  Father  in  the  name  of  Christ 
it  shall  be  granted  him;  and  this 
b promise is unto all, even unto the 
ends of the earth.

22 For  behold,  thus  said  Jesus 
Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  unto  his 
disciples  who  should  tarry,  yea, 
and also to a all his disciples, in the 
hearing  of  the  multitude:  Go  ye 
into all the world, and preach the 
gospel to every creature;

23 And he that  a believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved, but he that 
believeth not shall be b damned;

24 And  a these  signs  shall  follow 
them  that  believe—in  my  name 
shall they cast out b devils; they shall 
speak with new tongues; they shall

take up serpents; and if they drink 
any deadly thing it shall not hurt 
them; they shall lay c hands on the 
sick and they shall recover;
