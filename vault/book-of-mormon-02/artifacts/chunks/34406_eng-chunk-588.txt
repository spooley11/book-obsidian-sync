die, and the a fall had brought upon 
all  mankind  a  spiritual  b death  as

were  cut  off  from  the  presence 
of the Lord, it was expedient that 
mankind should be reclaimed from

as they were dead their souls were

presence of the Lord.

12 And now, there was no means 
to  reclaim  men  from  this  fallen 
state,  which  a man  had  brought 
upon  himself  because  of  his  own 
b disobedience;
