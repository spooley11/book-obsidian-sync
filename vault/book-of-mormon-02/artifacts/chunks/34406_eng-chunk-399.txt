murder, for he that b murdered was 
punished unto c death.

19 But it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church 
of  God  began  to  persecute  those 
that  did  belong  to  the  church  of 
God, and had taken upon them the 
name of Christ.

20 Yea, they did persecute them, 
and afflict them with all manner 
of words, and this because of their 
humility;  because  they  were  not 
proud  in  their  own  eyes,  and  be-
cause  they  did  impart  the  word 
of God, one with another, without 
a money and without price.

21 Now  there  was  a  strict  law 
among the people of the church, that  
there should a not any man, belong-
ing to the church, arise and perse-
cute those that did not belong to the 
church,  and  that  there  should  be 
no persecution among themselves.
22 Nevertheless, there were many 
among them who began to be proud, 
and began to contend warmly with 
their adversaries, even unto blows; 
yea, they would smite one another 
with their a fists.

23 Now this was in the second year 
of the reign of Alma, and it was a  
cause  of  much  affliction  to  the 
church; yea, it was the cause of much  
trial with the church.

24 For  the  hearts  of  many  were 
hardened,  and  their  names  were 
a blotted out, that they were remem-
bered no more among the people 
of God. And also many b withdrew 
themselves from among them.

25 Now  this  was  a  great  trial  to 
those that did stand fast in the faith; 
nevertheless, they were  a steadfast
