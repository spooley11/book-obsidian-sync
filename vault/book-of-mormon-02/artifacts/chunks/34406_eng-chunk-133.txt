2 But behold, their a anger did in-
crease  against  me,  insomuch  that 
they did seek to take away my life.
3 Yea, they did murmur against me, 
saying: Our younger brother thinks 
to  a rule over us; and we have had 
much trial because of him; where-
fore, now let us slay him, that we 
may not be afflicted more because  
of  his  words.  For  behold,  we  will 
not have him to be our ruler; for it 
belongs unto us, who are the elder 
brethren, to b rule over this people.
4 Now I do not write upon these 
plates  all  the  words  which  they 
murmured against me. But it suf-
ficeth me to say, that they did seek 
to take away my life.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord did a warn me, that I, b Nephi, 
should depart from them and flee 
into the wilderness, and all those 
who would go with me.

6 Wherefore, it came to pass that 
I, Nephi, did take my family, and 
also a Zoram and his family, and Sam, 
mine elder brother and his family,

and Jacob and Joseph, my younger 
brethren, and also my sisters, and 
all  those  who  would  go  with  me. 
And all those who would go with 
me were those who believed in the 
b warnings  and  the  revelations  of 
God; wherefore, they did hearken 
unto my words.

7 And we did take our tents and 
whatsoever things were possible for 
us, and did journey in the wilderness  
for the space of many days. And af-
ter we had journeyed for the space 
of many days we did pitch our tents.
8 And my people would that we 
should call the name of the place 
a Nephi;  wherefore,  we  did  call  it 
Nephi.

9 And all those who were with me 
did take upon them to call them-
selves the a people of Nephi.

10 And we did observe to keep the 
judgments, and the  a statutes, and 
the commandments of the Lord in 
all  things,  according  to  the  b law 
of Moses.

11 And the Lord was with us; and  
we did a prosper exceedingly; for we  
did sow seed, and we did reap again 
in abundance. And we began to raise 
flocks, and herds, and ani mals of 
every kind.
