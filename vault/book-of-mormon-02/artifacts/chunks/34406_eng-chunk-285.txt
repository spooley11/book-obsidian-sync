13 Yea,  and  moreover  I  say  unto 
you,  that  if  this  highly  favored 
people of the Lord should fall into

has hitherto preserved our fathers.
14 For I say unto you, that if he 
had  not  extended  his  arm  in  the 
preservation  of  our  fathers  they 
must have fallen into the hands of 
the Lamanites, and become victims 
to their hatred.

the Lord that thereby they might

sore c afflictions, to stir them up in 
d remembrance of their duty.
