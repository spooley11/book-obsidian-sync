CHAPTER 10
There is silence in the land for many 
hours—The voice of Christ promises to 
gather His people as a hen gathers her 
chickens—The more righteous part of 
the people have been preserved. About 
a.d. 34–35.
And  now  behold,  it  came  to  pass 
that all the people of the land did 
a hear these sayings, and did witness 
of it. And after these sayings there 
was silence in the land for the space 
of many hours;

2 For so great was the astonishment  
of the people that they did cease la-
menting and howling for the loss of  
their kindred which had been slain; 
therefore there was silence in all the 
land for the space of many hours.
3 And it came to pass that there 
came a voice again unto the people, 
and all the people did hear, and did 
witness of it, saying:

4 O ye people of these a great cit-
ies which have fallen, who are de-
scendants of Jacob, yea, who are of 
the house of Israel, how oft have I 
b gathered  you  as  a  hen  gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, and 
have c nourished you.

5 And again, a how oft would I have 
gathered  you  as  a  hen  gathereth 
her chickens under her wings, yea, 
O ye people of the house of Israel, 
who have fallen; yea, O ye people

of the house of Israel, ye that dwell 
at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; 
yea, how oft would I have gathered 
you as a hen gathereth her chick-
ens, and ye would not.

6 O ye house of Israel whom I have 
a spared, how oft will I gather you 
as  a  hen  gathereth  her  chickens 
under her wings, if ye will repent 
and b return unto me with full pur-
pose of c heart.

7 But  if  not,  O  house  of  Israel, 
the places of your dwellings shall 
become a desolate until the time of 
the  fulfilling  of  the  b covenant  to 
your fathers.

8 And  now  it  came  to  pass  that 
after  the  people  had  heard  these 
words, behold, they began to weep 
and howl a again because of the loss 
of their kindred and friends.
