sin and transgression, they become

had never known these things.

CHAPTER 25
Lamanite  aggressions  spread—The 
seed  of  the  priests  of  Noah  perish  as 
Abinadi  prophesied—Many  Laman-
ites are converted and join the people 
of  Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They  believe  in 
Christ and keep the law of Moses. About  
90–77 b.c.
And  behold,  now  it  came  to  pass 
that  those  Lamanites  were  more 
angry because they had slain their 
brethren;  therefore  they  swore 
vengeance upon the Nephites; and 
they did a no more attempt to slay 
the people of  b Anti-Nephi-Lehi at  
that time.

2 But they took their armies and 
went over into the borders of the 
land of Zarahemla, and fell upon 
the people who were in the land of 
Ammonihah and a destroyed them.
3 And after that, they had a many 
battles  with  the  Nephites,  in  the 
which they were driven and slain.
4 And among the Lamanites who 
were slain were almost all the a seed 
of Amulon and his brethren, who 
were the priests of Noah, and they 
were  slain  by  the  hands  of  the 
Nephites;

5 And the remainder, having fled 
into the east wilderness, and hav-
ing  usurped  the  power  and  a au-
thority over the Lamanites, caused 
that many of the Lamanites should 
b perish  by  fire  because  of  their  
belief—

6 For many of  a them, after having 
suffered  much  loss  and  so  many 
afflictions,  began  to  be  stirred 
up in remembrance of the b words 
which Aaron and his brethren had

preached  to  them  in  their  land; 
therefore they began to disbelieve 
the c traditions of their fathers, and 
to believe in the Lord, and that he 
gave great power unto the Nephites; 
and thus there were many of them 
converted in the wilderness.
