brethren, the Nephites, unto us to

ALMA 24  : 8–18

preach unto us, and to convince us of  
the a traditions of our wicked fathers.
8 And  behold,  I  thank  my  great 
God that he has given us a portion 
of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that 
we have a opened a correspondence 
with these brethren, the Nephites.
9 And behold, I also thank my God, 
that  by  opening  this  correspon-
dence we have been convinced of 
our a sins, and of the many murders 
which we have committed.

10 And I also thank my God, yea, 
my great God, that he hath granted 
unto  us  that  we  might  repent  of 
these things, and also that he hath 
a forgiven us of those our many sins 
and murders which we have com-
mitted, and taken away the b guilt 
from our hearts, through the mer-
its of his Son.

11 And now behold, my brethren, 
since it has been all that we could 
do (as we were the most lost of all 
mankind) to repent of all our sins 
and the many murders which we 
have committed, and to get God to 
a take them away from our hearts, 
for it was all we could do to repent 
sufficiently  before  God  that  he 
would take away our stain—

12 Now,  my  best  beloved  breth-
ren,  since  God  hath  taken  away 
our stains, and our swords have be-
come bright, then let us stain our 
swords no more with the blood of 
our brethren.
