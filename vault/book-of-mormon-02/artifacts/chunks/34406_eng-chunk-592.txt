ALMA 43  : 1–12

reveals to Alma the strategy of the La-
manites—The  Nephites  defend  their 
homes,  liberties,  families,  and  reli-
gion—The armies of Moroni and Lehi 
surround the Lamanites. About 74 b.c.

And now it came to pass that the 
sons  of  Alma  did  go  forth  among 
the  people,  to  declare  the  word 
unto them. And Alma, also, himself, 
could  not  a rest,  and  he  also  went  
forth.

2 Now a we shall say no more con-
cerning  their  preaching,  except 
that they preached the word, and 
the  truth,  according  to  the  spirit 
of  prophecy  and  revelation;  and 
they preached after the b holy order 
of God by which they were called.
3 And now a I return to an b account 
of the wars between the Nephites 
and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth 
year of the reign of the judges.

4 For behold, it came to pass that 
the a Zoramites became Lamanites; 
therefore,  in  the  commencement  
of the eighteenth year the people of  
the Nephites saw that the Lamanites 
were coming upon them; therefore 
they  made  preparations  for  war; 
yea,  they  gathered  together  their 
armies in the land of Jershon.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lamanites  came  with  their  thou-
sands; and they came into the land 
of a Antionum, which is the land of 
the  Zoramites;  and  a  man  by  the 
name  of  b Zerahemnah  was  their  
leader.

6 And  now,  as  the  a Amalekites 
were  of  a  more  wicked  and  mur-
derous  disposition  than  the  La-
manites were, in and of themselves, 
therefore, Zerahemnah appointed 
chief b captains over the Lamanites,

and they were all Amalekites and  
c Zoramites.

7 Now this he did that he might 
preserve their a hatred towards the 
Nephites, that he might bring them 
into subjection to the accomplish-
ment of his designs.

8 For  behold,  his  a designs  were 
to b stir up the Lamanites to anger 
against  the  Nephites;  this  he  did 
that  he  might  usurp  great  power 
over them, and also that he might 
gain  power  over  the  Nephites  by 
bringing them into c bondage.
