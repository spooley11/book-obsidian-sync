14 And behold, according to the 
words of the prophet, the Messiah 
will set himself again the a second 
time to recover them; wherefore, he 
will  b manifest  himself  unto  them 
in power and great glory, unto the 
c destruction of their enemies, when 
that  day  cometh  when  they  shall 
believe  in  him;  and  none  will  he 
destroy that believe in him.

15 And  they  that  believe  not  in 
him  shall  be  a destroyed,  both  by 
b fire, and by tempest, and by earth-
quakes, and by c bloodsheds, and by 
d pestilence,  and  by  e famine.  And 
they  shall  know  that  the  Lord  is 
God, the Holy One of Israel.

16 a For  shall  the  prey  be  taken 
from  the  mighty,  or  the  b lawful 
captive delivered?

17 But thus saith the Lord: Even 
the captives of the mighty shall be 
taken  away,  and  the  prey  of  the 
terrible shall be delivered; a for the 
b Mighty God shall c deliver his cov-
enant  people.  For  thus  saith  the 
Lord: I will contend with them that 
contendeth with thee—

18 And  I  will  feed  them  that  
oppress thee, with their own flesh; 
and  they  shall  be  drunken  with 
their  own  blood  as  with  sweet 
wine; and all flesh shall know that 
I the Lord am thy Savior and thy 
a Redeemer,  the  b Mighty  One  of  
Jacob.
