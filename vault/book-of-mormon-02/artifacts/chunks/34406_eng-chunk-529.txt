8 For behold, the Lord doth a grant 
unto b all nations, of their own na-
tion and c tongue, to teach his word, 
yea, in wisdom, all that he  d seeth 
fit that they should have; therefore 
we see that the Lord doth counsel 
in wisdom, according to that which 
is just and true.

9 I know that which the Lord hath 
commanded me, and I glory in it. 
I  do  a not  b glory  of  myself,  but  I 
glory in that which the Lord hath 
commanded  me;  yea,  and  this  is 
my glory, that perhaps I may be an 
instrument in the hands of God to 
bring some soul to repentance; and 
this is my joy.

10 And behold, when I see many 
of my brethren truly penitent, and 
coming to the Lord their God, then 
is my soul filled with joy; then do I 
remember a what the Lord has done

for me, yea, even that he hath heard 
my prayer; yea, then do I remem-
ber his merciful arm which he ex-
tended towards me.

11 Yea, and I also remember the 
captivity of my fathers; for I surely 
do know that the a Lord did deliver 
them out of bondage, and by this 
did  establish  his  church;  yea,  the 
Lord  God,  the  God  of  Abraham, 
the  God  of  Isaac,  and  the  God  of 
Jacob,  did  deliver  them  out  of  
bondage.

12 Yea, I have always remembered 
the captivity of my fathers; and that 
same God who a delivered them out 
of the hands of the Egyptians did 
deliver them out of b bondage.
