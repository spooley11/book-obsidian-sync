JACOB 4  : 4–11

124

4 For, for this intent have we writ-
ten  these  things,  that  they  may 
know that we a knew of Christ, and 
we had a hope of his b glory many 
hundred years before his coming; 
and  not  only  we  ourselves  had  a 
hope of his glory, but also all the 
holy c prophets which were before us.
5 Behold, they believed in Christ 
and  a worshiped  the  Father  in  his 
name,  and  also  we  worship  the 
Father in his  b name. And for this 
intent we c keep the d law of Moses, 
it  e pointing our souls to him; and 
for this cause it is sanctified unto 
us for righteousness, even as it was 
accounted  unto  Abraham  in  the 
wilderness to be obedient unto the 
commands of God in offering up his 
son Isaac, which is a f similitude of 
God and his g Only Begotten Son.

6 Wherefore, we search the proph-
ets, and we have many revelations 
and  the  spirit  of  a prophecy;  and 
having all these b witnesses we ob-
tain a hope, and our faith becometh 
unshaken, insomuch that we truly 
can  c command  in  the  d name  of 
Jesus  and  the  very  trees  obey  us, 
or the mountains, or the waves of  
the sea.

7 Nevertheless,  the  Lord  God 
showeth us our a weakness that we

may know that it is by his b grace, 
and his great condescensions unto 
the children of men, that we have 
power to do these things.

8 Behold, great and marvelous are 
the  a works  of  the  Lord.  How  b un-
searchable  are  the  depths  of  the 
c mysteries of him; and it is impos-
sible that man should find out all  
his  ways.  And  no  man  d knoweth  
of his e ways save it be revealed unto 
him; wherefore, brethren, despise 
not the f revelations of God.
