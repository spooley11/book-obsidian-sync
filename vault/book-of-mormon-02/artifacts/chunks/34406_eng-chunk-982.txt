16 And  again,  my  son,  there  are 
many a widows and their daughters 
who remain in Sherrizah; and that 
part  of  the  provisions  which  the 
Lamanites did not carry away, be-
hold, the army of Zenephi has car-
ried away, and left them to wander 
whithersoever  they  can  for  food; 
and many old women do faint by 
the way and die.

17 And  the  army  which  is  with 
me is weak; and the armies of the 
Lamanites  are  betwixt  Sherrizah 
and me; and as many as have fled 
to the army of  a Aaron have fallen 
victims to their awful brutality.

18 O  the  depravity  of  my  peo-
ple!  They  are  without  a order  and 
without mercy. Behold, I am but a 
man, and I have but the b strength 
of a man, and I cannot any longer 
enforce my commands.

19 And they have become strong 
in  their  perversion;  and  they  are 
alike brutal, sparing none, neither 
old nor young; and they delight in 
everything save that which is good; 
and the suffering of our women and 
our  children  upon  all  the  face  of 
this land doth exceed everything; 
yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can 
it be written.

20 And  now,  my  son,  I  dwell  no 
longer  upon  this  horrible  scene. 
Behold, thou knowest the wicked-
ness of this people; thou knowest 
that  they  are  without  principle, 
and  past  feeling;  and  their  wick-
edness  doth  a exceed  that  of  the  
Lamanites.

21 Behold, my son, I cannot rec-
ommend  them  unto  God  lest  he 
should smite me.

22 But  behold,  my  son,  I  recom-
mend thee unto God, and I trust in 
Christ that thou wilt be saved; and 
I a pray unto God that he will b spare 
thy life, to witness the return of his
