20 And the Lord will surely a pre-
pare a way for his people, unto the 
fulfilling  of  the  words  of  Moses, 
which he spake, saying: A b prophet 
shall  the  Lord  your  God  raise  up 
unto you, like unto me; him shall 
ye  hear  in  all  things  whatsoever 
he shall say unto you. And it shall 
come to pass that all those who will 
not hear that prophet shall be c cut 
off from among the people.

21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto 
you,  that  this  a prophet  of  whom 
Moses spake was the Holy One of 
Israel; wherefore, he shall execute 
b judgment in righteousness.

22 And the righteous need not fear,

for they are those who shall not be 
confounded. But it is the kingdom 
of the devil, which shall be built up 
among the children of men, which 
kingdom is established among them 
which are in the flesh—

23 For the time speedily shall come 
that all a churches which are built 
up to get gain, and all those who 
are built up to get power over the 
flesh, and those who are built up 
to become b popular in the eyes of 
the world, and those who seek the 
lusts of the flesh and the things of 
the world, and to do all manner of 
iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who 
belong to the kingdom of the c devil 
are they who need fear, and tremble, 
and d quake; they are those who must 
be  brought  low  in  the  dust;  they 
are those who must be e consumed 
as stubble; and this is according to 
the words of the prophet.

24 And  the  time  cometh  speed-
ily that the righteous must be led 
up as  a calves of the stall, and the 
Holy  One  of  Israel  must  reign  in 
dominion, and might, and power, 
and great b glory.

25 And he a gathereth his children 
from the four quarters of the earth; 
and he numbereth his b sheep, and 
they know him; and there shall be 
one fold and one shepherd; and he 
shall  feed  his  sheep,  and  in  him 
they shall find c pasture.

26 And because of the a righteous-
ness  of  his  people,  b Satan  has  no 
power;  wherefore,  he  cannot  be 
loosed for the space of c many years; 
for he hath no power over the hearts
