8 And it came to pass that Shule 
was  angry  with  his  brother;  and 
Shule  waxed  strong,  and  became 
mighty as to the strength of a man; 
and he was also mighty in judgment.
9 Wherefore, he came to the hill 
Ephraim, and he did molten out of 
the  hill,  and  made  swords  out  of 
a steel for those whom he had drawn  
away  with  him;  and  after  he  had 
armed them with swords he returned 
to the city Nehor, and gave battle  
unto his brother Corihor, by which 
means  he  obtained  the  kingdom 
and restored it unto his father Kib.
10 And now because of the thing 
which Shule had done, his father 
bestowed upon him the kingdom; 
therefore he began to reign in the 
stead of his father.

11 And it came to pass that he did 
execute judgment in righteousness; 
and he did spread his kingdom upon  
all the face of the land, for the people  
had become exceedingly numerous.
12 And it came to pass that Shule 
also begat many sons and daughters.
13 And  Corihor  repented  of  the 
many  evils  which  he  had  done; 
wherefore  Shule  gave  him  power 
in his kingdom.

14 And it came to pass that Corihor 
had many sons and daughters. And 
among the sons of Corihor there was 
one whose name was Noah.

15 And it came to pass that Noah

rebelled against Shule, the king, and  
also  his  father  Corihor,  and  drew 
away Cohor his brother, and also all 
his brethren and many of the people.
16 And he gave battle unto Shule, 
the king, in which he did obtain the 
land of their a first inheritance; and 
he became a king over that part of 
the land.

17 And it came to pass that he gave 
battle again unto Shule, the king;  
and he took Shule, the king, and car-
ried him away captive into Moron.
18 And it came to pass as he was 
about to put him to death, the sons 
of  Shule  crept  into  the  house  of 
Noah by night and slew him, and 
broke down the door of the prison 
and brought out their father, and 
placed him upon his throne in his 
own kingdom.
