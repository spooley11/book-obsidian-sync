Mormon  cries  repentance  unto  the 
Nephites—They gain a great victory and 
glory in their own strength—Mormon 
refuses to lead them, and his prayers 
for them are without faith—The Book 
of  Mormon  invites  the  twelve  tribes 
of  Israel  to  believe  the  gospel.  About  
a.d. 360–62.
And it came to pass that the Laman-
ites did not come to battle again un-
til ten years more had passed away. 
And  behold,  I  had  employed  my 
people, the Nephites, in preparing 
their lands and their arms against 
the time of battle.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  did  say  unto  me:  Cry  unto

MORMON 3  : 3–15

this people—Repent ye, and come 
unto me, and be ye baptized, and 
build up again my church, and ye 
shall be a spared.

3 And I did cry unto this people, 
but  it  was  a in  vain;  and  they  did 
b not  realize  that  it  was  the  Lord 
that had spared them, and granted 
unto them a chance for repentance. 
And behold they did harden their 
hearts against the Lord their God.
4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  after 
this  tenth  year  had  passed  away, 
making, in the whole, three hundred 
and sixty years from the coming of 
Christ,  the  king  of  the  Lamanites 
sent an epistle unto me, which gave 
unto  me  to  know  that  they  were 
preparing to come again to battle  
against us.

5 And  it  came  to  pass  that  I  did 
cause my people that they should 
gather themselves together at the 
land a Desolation, to a city which was 
in the borders, by the narrow pass 
which led into the land b southward.
6 And  there  we  did  place  our 
armies,  that  we  might  stop  the 
armies of the Lamanites, that they 
might not get possession of any of 
our lands; therefore we did fortify 
against them with all our force.
