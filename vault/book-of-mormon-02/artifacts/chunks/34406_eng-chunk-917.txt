10 And  he  answered:  Nay;  Lord,

a show thyself unto me.

11 And  the  Lord  said  unto  him: 
a Believest thou the words which I 
shall speak?

12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I 
know that thou speakest the truth, 
for  thou  art  a  God  of  truth,  and 
a canst not lie.

in the flesh.

17 And  now,  as  I,  Moroni,  said  I 
could  a not make a full account of 
these  things  which  are  written, 
therefore  it  sufficeth  me  to  say

Lord had showed unto him.
