ALMA 30  : 48–59

soul should be b lost than that thou 
shouldst be the means of bringing 
many  souls  down  to  destruction, 
by thy lying and by thy flattering 
words; therefore if thou shalt deny 
again, behold God shall smite thee, 
that thou shalt become dumb, that 
thou  shalt  never  open  thy  mouth 
any more, that thou shalt not de-
ceive this people any more.

48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do 
not deny the existence of a God, but 
I do not believe that there is a God; 
and I say also, that ye do not know 
that there is a God; and except ye  
show me a sign, I will not believe.
49 Now Alma said unto him: This 
will I give unto thee for a sign, that 
thou shalt be a struck dumb, accord-
ing to my words; and I say, that in 
the name of God, ye shall be struck 
dumb, that ye shall no more have 
utterance.

50 Now when Alma had said these 
words,  Korihor  was  struck  dumb, 
that he could not have utterance, 
according to the words of Alma.

51 And now when the chief judge 
saw this, he put forth his hand and 
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou 
convinced  of  the  power  of  God? 
In whom did ye desire that Alma 
should show forth his sign? Would 
ye that he should afflict others, to 
show unto thee a sign? Behold, he 
has  showed  unto  you  a  sign;  and 
now will ye dispute more?

52 And Korihor put forth his hand 
and  wrote,  saying:  I  know  that  I 
am dumb, for I cannot speak; and 
I  know  that  nothing  save  it  were 
the a power of God could bring this 
upon me; yea, and I always b knew 
that there was a God.
