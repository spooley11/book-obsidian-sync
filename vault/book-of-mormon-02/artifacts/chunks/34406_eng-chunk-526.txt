a death in the most aggravating and 
distressing manner which could be 
inflicted by their brethren, before 
they would take the sword or cime-
ter to smite them.

and  beloved  people,  a  highly  fa-
vored people of the Lord.

CHAPTER 28
The Lamanites are defeated in a tre-
mendous  battle—Tens  of  thousands 
are  slain—The  wicked  are  consigned 
to a state of endless woe; the righteous 
attain a never-ending happiness. About 
77–76 b.c.
And now it came to pass that after 
the people of Ammon were estab-
lished in the land of a Jershon, and 
a  church  also  established  in  the 
land of Jershon, and the armies of 
the Nephites were set round about 
the land of Jershon, yea, in all the 
borders  round  about  the  land  of 
Zarahemla;  behold  the  armies  of 
the Lamanites had followed their 
brethren into the wilderness.

2 And  thus  there  was  a  tremen-
dous battle; yea, even such an one 
as  never  had  been  known  among 
all the people in the land from the 
time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and 
tens of thousands of the Lamanites 
were slain and scattered abroad.

3 Yea, and also there was a tremen-
dous slaughter among the people of 
Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites 
were a driven and scattered, and the 
people of Nephi returned again to 
their land.

4 And  now  this  was  a  time  that 
there  was  a  great  a mourning  and 
lamentation heard throughout all 
the land, among all the people of 
Nephi—

5 Yea, the cry of a widows mourn-
ing for their husbands, and also of 
fathers  mourning  for  their  sons,

and the daughter for the brother, 
yea,  the  brother  for  the  father; 
and thus the cry of mourning was 
heard among all of them, mourn-
ing  for  their  kindred  who  had  
been slain.

6 And now surely this was a sor-
rowful  day;  yea,  a  time  of  solem-
nity, and a time of much  a fasting 
and prayer.
