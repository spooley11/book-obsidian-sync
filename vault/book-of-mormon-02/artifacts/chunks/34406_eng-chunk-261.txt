10 And according to the power of 
a justice, for justice cannot be denied, 
ye must go away into that b lake of 
fire and brimstone, whose flames 
are unquenchable, and whose smoke 
ascendeth  up  forever  and  ever, 
which lake of fire and brimstone 
is c endless d torment.

11 O then, my beloved brethren, 
repent ye, and enter in at the a strait 
gate,  and  b continue  in  the  way 
which is narrow, until ye shall ob-
tain eternal life.

12 O be a wise; what can I say more?
13 Finally, I bid you farewell, until

I shall meet you before the a pleas-
ing bar of God, which bar striketh 
the wicked with b awful dread and 
fear. Amen.

CHAPTER 7
Sherem  denies  Christ,  contends  with 
Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten 
of God—All of the prophets have spo-
ken of Christ and His Atonement—The 
Nephites lived out their days as wan-
derers, born in tribulation, and hated 
by the Lamanites. About 544–421 b.c.
And now it came to pass after some 
years had passed away, there came 
a man among the people of Nephi, 
whose name was a Sherem.

2 And  it  came  to  pass  that  he 
began  to  preach  among  the  peo-
ple, and to declare unto them that 
there should be a no Christ. And he 
preached many things which were 
flattering unto the people; and this 
he did that he might b overthrow the 
doctrine of Christ.

3 And he labored diligently that he 
might lead away the hearts of the  
people, insomuch that he did lead 
away many hearts; and he knowing  
that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who  
should come, he sought much oppor-
tunity that he might come unto me.
4 And  he  was  a learned,  that  he 
had a perfect knowledge of the lan-
guage of the people; wherefore, he 
could use much b flattery, and much 
power of speech, according to the 
c power of the devil.

5 And  he  had  hope  to  shake  me 
from the faith, notwithstanding the 
many  a revelations  and  the  many 
things which I had seen concerning
