2 And it came to pass in the nine-
teenth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi, that Alma 
came  unto  his  son  Helaman  and 
said unto him: Believest thou the 
words which I spake unto thee con-
cerning those a records which have  
been kept?

3 And  Helaman  said  unto  him:

Yea, I a believe.

4 And Alma said again: Believest 
thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?
5 And  he  said:  Yea,  I  believe  all 
the words which thou hast spoken.
6 And Alma said unto him again: 
Will ye a keep my commandments?
7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy 
commandments with all my heart.
8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed 
art thou; and the Lord shall a pros-
per thee in this land.

9 But  behold,  I  have  somewhat 
to  a prophesy  unto  thee;  but  what 
I prophesy unto thee ye shall not 
make known; yea, what I prophesy 
unto thee shall not be made known, 
even until the prophecy is fulfilled; 
therefore write the words which I 
shall say.

10 And  these  are  the  words:  Be-
hold, I perceive that this very peo-
ple, the Nephites, according to the 
spirit of revelation which is in me, 
in  a four  hundred  years  from  the 
time that Jesus Christ shall manifest 
himself unto them, shall dwindle in  
b unbelief.

11 Yea,  and  then  shall  they  see 
wars  and  pestilences,  yea,  fam-
ines and bloodshed, even until the

people  of  Nephi  shall  become  
a extinct—

12 Yea,  and  this  because  they 
shall dwindle in unbelief and fall 
into  the  works  of  darkness,  and 
a lasciviousness, and all manner of 
iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that 
because  they  shall  sin  against  so 
great light and knowledge, yea, I say 
unto you, that from that day, even 
the b fourth generation shall not all 
pass away before this great iniquity  
shall come.
