2 Wherefore, in my days, I would 
that ye should know that I fought 
much  with  the  sword  to  preserve 
my people, the Nephites, from fall-
ing into the hands of their enemies, 
the Lamanites. But behold, I of my-
self a am a wicked man, and I have 
not kept the statutes and the com-
mandments of the Lord as I ought 
to have done.

3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  two 
hundred and seventy and six years 
had passed away, and we had many  
seasons  of  peace;  and  we  had  
many  a seasons of serious war and 
bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hun-
dred and eighty and two years had 
passed away, and I had kept these 
plates according to the b command-
ments  of  my  c fathers;  and  I  d con-
ferred them upon my son Amaron.  
And I make an end.

4 And  now  I,  Amaron,  write  the 
things  whatsoever  I  write,  which 
are few, in the book of my father.

5 Behold,  it  came  to  pass  that 
three  hundred  and  twenty  years 
had  passed  away,  and  the  more 
wicked part of the Nephites were  
a destroyed.

6 For the Lord would not suffer, 
after  he  had  led  them  out  of  the 
land  of  Jerusalem  and  kept  and 
preserved them from falling into 
the  hands  of  their  enemies,  yea, 
he would not suffer that the words 
should  not  be  verified,  which  he

spake unto our fathers, saying that: 
a Inasmuch as ye will not keep my 
commandments ye shall not b pros-
per in the land.

7 Wherefore,  the  Lord  did  visit 
them  in  great  judgment;  never-
theless, he did spare the righteous 
that  they  should  not  perish,  but 
did deliver them out of the hands 
of their enemies.
