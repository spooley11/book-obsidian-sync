city, and they called the name of 
the city a Moroni; and it was by the 
east sea; and it was on the south by 
the  line  of  the  possessions  of  the 
Lamanites.

14 And  they  also  began  a  foun-
dation for a city between the city 
of  Moroni  and  the  city  of  Aaron, 
joining the borders of Aaron and 
Moroni; and they called the name 
of the city, or the land, a Nephihah.
15 And  they  also  began  in  that 
same year to build many cities on 
the north, one in a particular man-
ner which they called a Lehi, which 
was in the north by the borders of 
the seashore.

16 And thus ended the twentieth

year.

17 And in these prosperous circum-
stances were the people of Nephi in 
the commencement of the twenty 
and  first  year  of  the  reign  of  the 
judges over the people of Nephi.

18 And they did prosper a exceed-
ingly, and they became exceedingly 
rich; yea, and they did multiply and 
wax strong in the land.

19 And  thus  we  see  how  merci-
ful and just are all the dealings of 
the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his 
words unto the children of men; yea, 
we can behold that his words are 
veri fied,  even  at  this  time,  which 
he spake unto Lehi, saying:

20 Blessed art thou and thy chil-
dren;  and  they  shall  be  blessed, 
inasmuch  as  they  shall  keep  my 
a commandments  they  shall  pros-
per in the land. But remember, in-
asmuch as they will not keep my 
commandments they shall be b cut 
off from the presence of the Lord.
21 And  we  see  that  these  prom-
ises have been verified to the peo-
ple of Nephi; for it has been their 
quarrelings and their contentions, 
yea,  their  murderings,  and  their

plunderings,  their  idolatry,  their 
whoredoms,  and  their  abomina-
tions,  which  were  among  them-
selves, which a brought upon them 
their wars and their destructions.

22 And  those  who  were  faithful 
in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord were delivered at all times, 
whilst  thousands  of  their  wicked 
brethren  have  been  consigned  to 
bondage, or to perish by the sword, 
or to dwindle in unbelief, and min-
gle with the Lamanites.
