of the Lord poured out according to 
his a prayers upon the Lamanites, his 
brethren, who had been the cause 
of  so  much  mourning  among  the 
Nephites, or among all the people 
of God because of their iniquities 
and their b traditions, he fell upon 
his knees, and began to pour out his 
soul in prayer and thanksgiving to 
God for what he had done for his 
brethren; and he was also overpow-
ered  with  c joy;  and  thus  they  all 
three had d sunk to the earth.

15 Now, when the servants of the 
king had seen that they had fallen, 
they  also  began  to  cry  unto  God, 
for the fear of the Lord had come 
upon  them  also,  for  it  was  a they 
who had stood before the king and 
testified unto him concerning the 
great power of Ammon.

16 And it came to pass that they 
did call on the name of the Lord, in 
their might, even until they had all 
fallen to the earth, save it were one 
of the Lamanitish a women, whose 
name was Abish, she having been 
converted unto the Lord for many 
years, on account of a remarkable 
vision of her father—

17 Thus, having been converted to 
the Lord, and never having made 
it a known, therefore, when she saw 
that all the servants of Lamoni had 
b fallen  to  the  earth,  and  also  her 
mistress, the queen, and the king, 
and  Ammon  lay  c prostrate  upon 
the earth, she knew that it was the 
power of God; and supposing that 
this opportunity, by making known 
unto the people what had happened 
among them, that by beholding this 
scene it would  d cause them to be-
lieve in the power of God, therefore 
she ran forth from house to house, 
making it known unto the people.
18 And  they  began  to  assemble 
themselves together unto the house
