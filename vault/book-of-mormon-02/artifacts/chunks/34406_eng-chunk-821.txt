Behold, now it came to pass that 
when Jesus had spoken these words 
he looked round about again on the 
multitude, and he said unto them: 
Behold, my a time is at hand.

2 I  a perceive  that  ye  are  weak, 
that ye cannot b understand all my 
words which I am commanded of 
the  Father  to  speak  unto  you  at 
this time.

3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, 
and a ponder upon the things which 
I have said, and ask of the Father, in 
my name, that ye may understand,

and  b prepare  your  minds  for  the 
c morrow, and I come unto you again.
4 But now I  a go unto the Father, 
and also to b show myself unto the 
lost tribes of Israel, for they are not 
c lost unto the Father, for he knoweth 
whither he hath taken them.

5 And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his 
eyes  round  about  again  on  the 
multitude,  and  beheld  they  were 
a in tears, and did look steadfastly 
upon  him  as  if  they  would  ask 
him  to  tarry  a  little  longer  with  
them.

6 And he said unto them: Behold, 
my bowels are filled with a compas-
sion towards you.

7 Have ye any that are a sick among 
you?  Bring  them  hither.  Have  ye 
any that are lame, or blind, or halt, 
or maimed, or b leprous, or that are 
withered, or that are deaf, or that 
are afflicted in any manner? Bring 
them hither and I will c heal them, 
for  I  have  compassion  upon  you; 
my bowels are filled with mercy.

8 For I perceive that ye desire that  
I should show unto you what I have 
done  unto  your  brethren  at  Jeru-
salem, for I see that your  a faith is 
b sufficient that I should heal you.

9 And it came to pass that when he 
had thus spoken, all the multitude, 
with one accord, did go forth with 
their sick and their afflicted, and 
their lame, and with their  a blind, 
and with their dumb, and with all 
them  that  were  afflicted  in  any 
manner; and he did heal them ev-
ery one as they were brought forth  
unto him.
