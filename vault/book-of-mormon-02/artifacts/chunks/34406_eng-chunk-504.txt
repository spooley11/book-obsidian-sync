28 Now, the more a idle part of the 
Lamanites lived in the wilderness, 
and dwelt in tents; and they were 
spread through the wilderness on 
the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, 
and also on the west of the land of 
Zarahemla,  in  the  borders  by  the 
seashore,  and  on  the  west  in  the 
land of Nephi, in the place of their 
fathers’ first inheritance, and thus 
bordering along by the seashore.

29 And also there were many La-
manites on the east by the seashore, 
whither  the  Nephites  had  driven 
them. And thus the Nephites were 
nearly surrounded by the Laman-
ites; nevertheless the Nephites had 
taken possession of all the north-
ern parts of the land bordering on 
the wilderness, at the head of the 
river  Sidon,  from  the  east  to  the 
west,  round  about  on  the  wilder-
ness side; on the north, even until 
they came to the land which they 
called a Bountiful.

30 And  it  bordered  upon  the 
land  which  they  called  a Desola-
tion, it being so far northward that 
it  came  into  the  land  which  had 
been peopled and been destroyed, 
of  whose  b bones  we  have  spoken, 
which was discovered by the c peo-
ple of Zarahemla, it being the place 
of their d first landing.

31 And they came from there a up 
into the south wilderness. Thus the 
b land on the northward was called 
c Desolation,  and  the  land  on  the 
southward  was  called  Bountiful, 
it  being  the  wilderness  which  is 
filled with all manner of wild ani-
mals of every kind, a part of which 
had come from the land northward  
for food.

32 And now, it was only the a dis-
tance of a day and a half’s journey 
for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful 
and the land Desolation, from the 
east to the west sea; and thus the

land of Nephi and the land of Zara-
hemla were nearly surrounded by 
water, there being a small b neck of 
land between the land northward 
and the land southward.
