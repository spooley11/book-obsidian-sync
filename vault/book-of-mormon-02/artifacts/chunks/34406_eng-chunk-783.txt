25 Therefore a complaint came up 
unto the land of Zarahemla, to the 
governor of the land, against these 
judges  who  had  condemned  the 
prophets of the Lord unto  a death, 
not according to the law.

26 Now it came to pass that they 
were taken and brought up before 
the judge, to be judged of the crime 
which they had done, according to 
the a law which had been given by 
the people.

27 Now it came to pass that those 
judges had many friends and kin-
dreds; and the remainder, yea, even 
almost all the lawyers and the high 
priests,  did  gather  themselves  to-
gether, and unite with the kindreds 
of those judges who were to be tried 
according to the law.

28 And they did enter into a a cov-
enant  one  with  another,  yea,  even 
into that covenant which was given 
by them of old, which covenant was 
given and administered by the b devil, 
to combine against all righteousness.

29 Therefore  they  did  combine 
against the people of the Lord, and 
enter  into  a  covenant  to  destroy 
them, and to deliver those who were 
guilty of murder from the grasp of 
justice, which was about to be ad-
ministered according to the law.

30 And they did set at defiance the 
law and the rights of their country; 
and they did covenant one with an-
other to destroy the governor, and 
to establish a a king over the land, 
that  the  land  should  no  more  be 
at  b liberty  but  should  be  subject 
unto kings.
