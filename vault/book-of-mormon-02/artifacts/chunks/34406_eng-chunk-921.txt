8 And he that will a contend against 
the  word  of  the  Lord,  let  him  be 
accursed; and he that shall  b deny 
these things, let him be accursed; 
for unto them will I show c no greater 
things, saith Jesus Christ; for I am 
he who speaketh.

9 And at my command the heav-
ens are opened and are a shut; and 
at my word the b earth shall shake; 
and at my command the inhabitants 
thereof shall pass away, even so as  
by fire.

10 And he that believeth not my 
words believeth not my disciples; 
and if it so be that I do not speak, 
judge ye; for ye shall know that it 
is I that speaketh, at the a last day.
11 But  he  that  a believeth  these

things  which  I  have  spoken,  him 
will I visit with the manifestations 
of  my  Spirit,  and  he  shall  b know 
and  bear  record.  For  because  of 
my Spirit he shall c know that these 
things are  d true; for it persuadeth 
men to do good.

12 And whatsoever thing persuad-
eth  men  to  do  good  is  of  me;  for 
a good cometh of none save it be of 
me. I am the same that leadeth men 
to all good; he that will b not believe 
my words will not believe me—that 
I am; and he that will not believe me 
will not believe the Father who sent 
me. For behold, I am the Father, I 
am the c light, and the d life, and the  
e truth of the world.

13 a Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, 
and I will show unto you the greater 
things, the knowledge which is hid 
up because of unbelief.

14 Come unto me, O ye house of 
Israel, and it shall be made a mani-
fest unto you how great things the 
Father hath laid up for you, from 
the foundation of the world; and it 
hath not come unto you, because of  
unbelief.
