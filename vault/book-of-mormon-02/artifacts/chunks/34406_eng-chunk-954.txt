6 And that a a New Jerusalem should 
be built up upon this land, unto the 
remnant of the seed of b Joseph, for  
which things there has been a c type.
7 For as Joseph brought his father 
down into the land of a Egypt, even 
so  he  died  there;  wherefore,  the 
Lord brought a remnant of the seed 
of Joseph out of the land of Jeru-
salem,  that  he  might  be  merciful 
unto the seed of Joseph that they 
should b perish not, even as he was 
merciful unto the father of Joseph 
that he should perish not.

8 Wherefore, the remnant of the 
house of Joseph shall be built upon 
this a land; and it shall be a land of 
their  inheritance;  and  they  shall 
build up a holy b city unto the Lord, 
like unto the Jerusalem of old; and 
they shall c no more be confounded, 
until the end come when the earth 
shall pass away.

9 And there shall be a a new heaven 
and a new earth; and they shall be 
like unto the old save the old have 
passed  away,  and  all  things  have 
become new.

10 And then cometh the New Je-
rusalem; and blessed are they who 
dwell therein, for it is they whose 
garments  are  a white  through  the 
blood  of  the  Lamb;  and  they  are 
they who are numbered among the 
remnant of the seed of Joseph, who 
were of the house of Israel.

11 And  then  also  cometh  the  
a Jerusalem of old; and the inhabi-
tants thereof, blessed are they, for
