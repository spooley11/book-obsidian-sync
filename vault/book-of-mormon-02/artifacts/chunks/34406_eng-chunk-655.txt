13 And now these are the cities of 
which the Lamanites have obtained 
possession by the shedding of the 
blood of so many of our valiant men:
14 The land of a Manti, or the city 
of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, 
and  the  city  of  b Cumeni,  and  the 
city of Antiparah.

15 And these are the cities which 
they  possessed  when  I  arrived  at 
the city of Judea; and I found Anti-
pus and his men toiling with their 
might to fortify the city.

16 Yea, and they were depressed 
in body as well as in spirit, for they 
had  fought  valiantly  by  day  and 
toiled  by  night  to  maintain  their 
cities; and thus they had suffered 
great afflictions of every kind.

17 And now they were determined 
to conquer in this place or die; there-
fore you may well suppose that this 
little  force  which  I  brought  with 
me, yea, those a sons of mine, gave 
them great hopes and much joy.

18 And now it came to pass that 
when the Lamanites saw that Anti-
pus had received a greater strength 
to his army, they were compelled 
by the orders of Ammoron to not 
come against the city of Judea, or 
against us, to battle.

19 And  thus  were  we  favored  of 
the Lord; for had they come upon 
us in this our weakness they might 
have  perhaps  destroyed  our  little 
army; but thus were we preserved.
20 They  were  commanded  by 
Ammoron to maintain those cities 
which  they  had  taken.  And  thus 
ended  the  twenty  and  sixth  year. 
And in the commencement of the 
twenty  and  seventh  year  we  had 
prepared our city and ourselves for  
defence.

21 Now  we  were  desirous  that 
the  Lamanites  should  come  upon 
us;  for  we  were  not  desirous  to 
make an attack upon them in their  
strongholds.

22 And it came to pass that we kept

spies out round about, to watch the 
movements of the Lamanites, that 
they  might  not  pass  us  by  night 
nor by day to make an attack upon 
our other cities which were on the 
northward.
