35 And it came to pass that a Zoram 
did take courage at the words which 
I spake. Now Zoram was the name of  
the servant; and he promised that he  
would go down into the wilderness 
unto  our  father.  Yea,  and  he  also 
made an oath unto us that he would 
tarry with us from that time forth.
36 Now we were desirous that he 
should tarry with us for this cause, 
that the Jews might not know con-
cerning our flight into the wilder-
ness, lest they should pursue us and 
destroy us.

Zoram had made an a oath unto us, 
our b fears did cease concerning him.
38 And  it  came  to  pass  that  we 
took the plates of brass and the ser-
vant  of  Laban,  and  departed  into 
the wilderness, and journeyed unto 
the a tent of our father.

CHAPTER 5

Sariah complains against Lehi—Both 
rejoice over the return of their sons—
They  offer  sacrifices—The  plates  of 
brass contain writings of Moses and the 
prophets—The plates identify Lehi as a 
descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophesies 
concerning his seed and the preserva-
tion of the plates. About 600–592 b.c.
And it came to pass that after we 
had come down into the wilderness 
unto our father, behold, he was filled 
with joy, and also my mother, Sa-
riah, was exceedingly glad, for she 
truly had mourned because of us.
2 For  she  had  supposed  that  we 
had perished in the wilderness; and 
she  also  had  a complained  against 
my father, telling him that he was 
a  b visionary  man;  saying:  Behold 
thou hast led us forth from the land 
of  our  inheritance,  and  my  sons 
are no more, and we perish in the 
wilderness.

3 And  after  this  manner  of  lan-
guage had my mother complained 
against my father.
