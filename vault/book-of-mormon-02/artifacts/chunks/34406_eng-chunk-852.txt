12 Therefore  I,  a Mormon,  do 
write the things which have been  
commanded me of the Lord. And 
now  I,  b Mormon,  make  an  end  of 
my sayings, and proceed to write 
the things which have been com-
manded me.

13 Therefore,  I  would  that  ye 
should behold that the Lord truly 
did teach the people, for the space 
of three days; and after that he did 
a show himself unto them oft, and 
did break  b bread oft, and bless it, 
and give it unto them.

14 And it came to pass that he did 
teach and minister unto the a chil-
dren  of  the  multitude  of  whom 
hath been spoken, and he did b loose 
their c tongues, and they did speak 
unto their fathers great and mar-
velous things, even greater than he 
had revealed unto the people; and 
he  loosed  their  tongues  that  they  
could utter.

15 And it came to pass that after 
he had ascended into heaven—the 
second time that he showed him-
self unto them, and had gone unto 
the  Father,  after  having  a healed 
all their sick, and their lame, and  
opened  the  eyes  of  their  blind  
and unstopped the ears of the deaf, 
and even had done all manner of 
cures  among  them,  and  raised  a 
man from the b dead, and had shown 
forth his power unto them, and had 
ascended unto the Father—

16 Behold, it came to pass on the 
morrow that the multitude gathered 
themselves together, and they both 
saw and heard these children; yea, 
even a babes did open their mouths
