13 And it came to pass that these 
were  the  words  which  Helaman 
a taught  to  his  sons;  yea,  he  did 
teach them many things which are 
not written, and also many things 
which are written.

14 And  they  did  remember  his 
words;  and  therefore  they  went 
forth, keeping the commandments 
of  God,  to  teach  the  word  of  God 
among all the people of Nephi, be-
ginning at the city Bountiful;

15 And  from  thenceforth  to  the

city  of  Gid;  and  from  the  city  of 
Gid to the city of Mulek;

16 And even from one city to an-
other,  until  they  had  gone  forth 
a among  all  the  people  of  Nephi 
who  were  in  the  land  southward; 
and from thence into the land of 
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.
17 And it came to pass that they 
did a preach with great b power, inso-
much that they did confound many 
of those c dissenters who had gone 
over from the Nephites, insomuch 
that they came forth and did con-
fess  their  sins  and  were  baptized 
unto repentance, and immediately 
returned to the Nephites to endeavor 
to  repair  unto  them  the  wrongs 
which they had done.

18 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did preach unto the Laman-
ites with such great power and author-
ity, for they had power and authority 
given  unto  them  that  they  might  
a speak, and they also had what they 
should speak given unto them—

19 Therefore they did speak unto 
the great astonishment of the La-
manites,  to  the  convincing  them, 
insomuch that there were eight thou-
sand of the Lamanites who were in  
the land of Zarahemla and round 
about  a baptized  unto  repentance, 
and were convinced of the  b wick-
edness  of  the  c traditions  of  their 
fathers.

20 And it came to pass that Nephi 
and Lehi did proceed from thence 
to go to the a land of Nephi.

21 And it came to pass that they 
were taken by an army of the La-
manites and cast into a prison; yea, 
even in that same prison in which 
Ammon and his brethren were cast 
by the servants of Limhi.
