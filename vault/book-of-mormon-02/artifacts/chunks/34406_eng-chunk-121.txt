children; yea, even the  a family of 
all the earth.

21 And  the  days  of  the  children 
of  a men  were  prolonged,  accord-
ing  to  the  b will  of  God,  that  they 
might  c repent  while  in  the  flesh; 
wherefore,  their  state  became  a 
state of d probation, and their time 
was  lengthened,  according  to  the 
commandments which the Lord God 
gave unto the children of men. For 
he gave commandment that all men 
must repent; for he showed unto all 
men that they were e lost, because of 
the transgression of their parents.
22 And  now,  behold,  if  Adam 
had not transgressed he would not  
have  fallen,  but  he  would  have 
remained  in  the  garden  of   Eden. 
And all things which were created 
must  have  remained  in  the  same 
state in which they were after they 
were created; and they must have 
remained forever, and had no end.
23 And  they  would  have  had  no 
a children;  wherefore  they  would 
have remained in a state of inno-
cence, having no b joy, for they knew 
no misery; doing no good, for they 
knew no c sin.

24 But  behold,  all  things  have 
been  done  in  the  wisdom  of  him 
who a knoweth all things.

25 a Adam  b fell  that  men  might 
be; and men c are, that they might 
have d joy.

26 And  the  a Messiah  cometh  in 
the  fulness  of  time,  that  he  may

b redeem the children of men from 
the fall. And because that they are 
c redeemed from the fall they have 
become d free forever, knowing good 
from  evil;  to  act  for  themselves 
and  not  to  be  acted  upon,  save  it 
be by the punishment of the e law 
at the great and last day, according 
to the commandments which God 
hath given.
