presence of God, a save it be through 
the merits, and mercy, and grace of 
the Holy Messiah, who b layeth down 
his life according to the flesh, and 
taketh it again by the power of the 
Spirit,  that  he  may  bring  to  pass  
the c resurrection of the dead, being 
the first that should rise.

9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits 
unto  God,  inasmuch  as  he  shall 
make a intercession for all the chil-
dren of men; and they that believe 
in him shall be saved.

10 And  because  of  the  interces-
sion  for  a all,  all  men  come  unto 
God; wherefore, they stand in the 
presence of him, to be  b judged of 
him according to the truth and c ho-
liness which is in him. Wherefore, 
the ends of the law which the Holy 
One hath given, unto the inflicting 
of the d punishment which is affixed, 
which punishment that is affixed 
is in opposition to that of the hap-
piness which is affixed, to answer 
the ends of the e atonement—

11 For it must needs be, that there 
is an a opposition in all things. If not 
so, my firstborn in the wilderness, 
righteousness could not be brought 
to  pass,  neither  wickedness,  nei-
ther  holiness  nor  misery,  neither 
good nor bad. Wherefore, all things 
must needs be a compound in one;
