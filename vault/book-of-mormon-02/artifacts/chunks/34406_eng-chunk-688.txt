10 And it came to pass in the thirty  
and ninth year of the reign of the 
judges,  a Shiblon  died  also,  and  
Corianton  had  gone  forth  to  the 
land northward in a ship, to carry 
forth  provisions  unto  the  people 
who had gone forth into that land.
11 Therefore it became expedient 
for a Shiblon to confer those sacred 
things, before his death, upon the 
son  of  b Helaman,  who  was  called 
c Helaman,  being  called  after  the 
name of his father.

12 Now behold, all those a engrav-
ings which were in the possession 
of Helaman were written and sent 
forth  among  the  children  of  men 
throughout  all  the  land,  save  it 
were  those  parts  which  had  been 
commanded by Alma should  b not 
go forth.

13 Nevertheless, these things were 
to  be  kept  sacred,  and  a handed 
down  from  one  generation  to  an-
other; therefore, in this year, they 
had been conferred upon Helaman, 
before the death of Shiblon.

14 And it came to pass also in this 
year that there were some dissenters

who  had  gone  forth  unto  the  La-
manites; and they were a stirred up 
again to anger against the Nephites.
15 And  also  in  this  same  year 
they came down with a numerous 
army  to  war  against  the  people  
of a Moronihah, or against the army of  
Moronihah, in the which they were

beaten  and  driven  back  again  to 
their own lands, suffering great loss.
16 And thus ended the thirty and 
ninth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi.

17 And thus ended the account of 
a Alma,  and  Helaman  his  son,  and 
also Shiblon, who was his son.
