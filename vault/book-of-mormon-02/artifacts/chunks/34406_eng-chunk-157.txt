CHAPTER 10

Jacob explains that the Jews will crucify 
their God—They will be scattered until 
they begin to believe in Him—America 
will be a land of liberty where no king 
will rule—Reconcile yourselves to God 
and gain salvation through His grace. 
About 559–545 b.c.
And now I, Jacob, speak unto you 
again,  my  beloved  brethren,  con-
cerning  this  righteous  a branch  of 
which I have spoken.

2 For behold, the a promises which 
we have obtained are promises unto 
us according to the flesh; wherefore, 
as it has been shown unto me that 
many of our children shall perish 
in  the  flesh  because  of  b unbelief, 
nevertheless, God will be merciful 
unto many; and our children shall 
be  c restored,  that  they  may  come 
to  that  which  will  give  them  the 
true knowledge of their Redeemer.
3 Wherefore,  as  I  said  unto  you, 
it  must  needs  be  expedient  that 
Christ—for in the last night the a an-
gel spake unto me that this should 
be his name—should b come among 
the c Jews, among those who are the 
more wicked part of the world; and 
they  shall  d crucify  him—for  thus 
it  behooveth  our  God,  and  there 
is none other nation on earth that 
would e crucify their f God.

4 For should the mighty a miracles 
be  wrought  among  other  nations 
they would repent, and know that 
he be their God.

5 But because of a priestcrafts and 
iniquities,  they  at  Jerusalem  will 
b stiffen  their  necks  against  him, 
that he be c crucified.

6 Wherefore, because of their in-
iquities, destructions, famines, a pes-
tilences, and bloodshed shall come 
upon them; and they who shall not 
be  destroyed  shall  be  b scattered 
among all nations.
