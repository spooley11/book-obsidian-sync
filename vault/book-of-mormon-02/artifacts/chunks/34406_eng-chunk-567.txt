The plates of brass and other scriptures 
are  preserved  to  bring  souls  to  salva-
tion—The  Jaredites  were  destroyed 
because  of  their  wickedness—Their 
secret  oaths  and  covenants  must  be 
kept  from  the  people—Counsel  with 
the  Lord  in  all  your  doings—As  the 
Liahona  guided  the  Nephites,  so  the 
word of Christ leads men to eternal life.

And now, my son Helaman, I com-
mand you that ye take the a records 
which have been b entrusted with me;
2 And I also command you that ye 
keep a a record of this people, accord-
ing as I have done, upon the plates 
of Nephi, and keep all these things

sacred which I have kept, even as I 
have kept them; for it is for a b wise 
purpose that they are kept.

3 And these a plates of brass, which 
contain  these  engravings,  which 
have the records of the holy scrip-
tures  upon  them,  which  have  the 
b genealogy of our forefathers, even 
from the beginning—

4 Behold, it has been prophesied 
by our fathers, that they should be 
kept and a handed down from one 
generation to another, and be kept 
and preserved by the hand of the 
Lord until they should go forth unto 
every nation, kindred, tongue, and 
people, that they shall know of the 
b mysteries contained thereon.

5 And  now  behold,  if  they  are 
kept they must retain their bright-
ness; yea, and they will retain their 
brightness;  yea,  and  also  shall  all 
the  plates  which  do  contain  that 
which is holy writ.

6 Now ye may suppose that this is 
a foolishness in me; but behold I say 
unto you, that by  b small and sim-
ple things are great things brought 
to pass; and small means in many 
instances doth confound the wise.
7 And  the  Lord  God  doth  work 
by a means to bring about his great 
and eternal purposes; and by very 
b small means the Lord doth  c con-
found the wise and bringeth about 
the salvation of many souls.

8 And  now,  it  has  hitherto  been 
wisdom  in  God  that  these  things 
should  be  preserved;  for  behold, 
a they have  b enlarged the memory 
of this people, yea, and convinced 
many of the error of their ways, and 
brought them to the c knowledge of
