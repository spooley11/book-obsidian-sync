46 And it came to pass that there 
came  a  voice  unto  them,  yea,  a 
pleasant voice, as if it were a whis-
per, saying:

47 a Peace, peace be unto you, be-
cause of your faith in my Well Be-
loved, who was from the foundation 
of the world.

48 And now, when they heard this 
they cast up their eyes as if to be-
hold from whence the voice came; 
and behold, they saw the a heavens 
open;  and  angels  came  down  out 
of  heaven  and  ministered  unto  
them.

49 And  there  were  about  three 
hundred souls who saw and heard 
these things; and they were bidden 
to go forth and marvel not, neither 
should they doubt.

50 And it came to pass that they 
did go forth, and did minister unto 
the  people,  declaring  throughout 
all the regions round about all the 
things which they had heard and 
seen, insomuch that the more part 
of the Lamanites were a convinced 
of  them,  because  of  the  great-
ness  of  the  evidences  which  they  
had received.

51 And as many as were a convinced 
did  lay  down  their  weapons  of  
war, and also their hatred and the 
tradition of their fathers.

52 And it came to pass that they 
did a yield up unto the Nephites the 
lands of their possession.
