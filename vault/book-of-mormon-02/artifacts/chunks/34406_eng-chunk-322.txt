King Laman dies—His people are wild 
and ferocious and believe in false tra-
ditions—Zeniff and his people prevail 
against them. About 187–160 b.c.
And it came to pass that we again 
began to establish the kingdom and 
we again began to possess the land 
in peace. And I caused that there 
should  be  a weapons  of  war  made 
of every kind, that thereby I might 
have weapons for my people against 
the time the Lamanites should come 
up again to war against my people.
2 And  I  set  guards  round  about 
the land, that the Lamanites might 
not come upon us again unawares 
and destroy us; and thus I did guard 
my people and my flocks, and keep 
them  from  falling  into  the  hands 
of our enemies.

3 And it came to pass that we did 
inherit the land of our fathers for 
many  years,  yea,  for  the  space  of 
twenty and two years.

4 And  I  did  cause  that  the  men 
should till the ground, and raise all 
manner of  a grain and all manner 
of fruit of every kind.

5 And I did cause that the women 
should spin, and toil, and work, and 
work all manner of fine linen, yea, 
and  a cloth  of  every  kind,  that  we 
might  clothe  our  nakedness;  and 
thus we did prosper in the land—
thus we did have continual peace 
in the land for the space of twenty 
and two years.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  king 
a Laman died, and his son began to 
reign  in  his  stead.  And  he  began 
to  stir  his  people  up  in  rebellion 
against my people; therefore they 
began  to  prepare  for  war,  and  to 
come up to battle against my people.
7 But I had sent my spies out round 
about the land of a Shemlon, that I

might discover their preparations, 
that  I  might  guard  against  them, 
that they might not come upon my 
people and destroy them.

8 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
came  up  upon  the  north  of  the 
land of Shilom, with their numer-
ous hosts, men a armed with b bows,  
and with arrows, and with swords,  
and  with  cimeters,  and  with  
stones, and with slings; and they had  
their heads shaved that they were 
naked; and they were girded with a  
leathern girdle about their loins.
