CHAPTER 25
At the Second Coming, the proud and 
wicked will be burned as stubble—Eli-
jah  will  return  before  that  great  and 
dreadful  day—Compare  Malachi  4. 
About a.d. 34.
a For behold, the day cometh that 
shall b burn as an oven; and all the 
c proud, yea, and all that do wick-
edly, shall be stubble; and the day 
that  cometh  shall  burn  them  up, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall 
leave them neither root nor branch.
2 But unto you that fear my name, 
shall  the  a Son  of  Righteousness 
arise with healing in his wings; and 
ye shall go forth and  b grow up as 
c calves in the stall.
