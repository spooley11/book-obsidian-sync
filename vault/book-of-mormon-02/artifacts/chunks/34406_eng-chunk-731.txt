36 And  then  shall  he  say  unto 
you,  that  I,  Nephi,  know  nothing 
concerning the matter save it were 
given unto me by the power of God. 
And then shall ye know that I am 
an honest man, and that I am sent 
unto you from God.

37 And it came to pass that they 
went  and  did,  even  according  as 
Nephi had said unto them. And be-

were true; for according to the words 
he did deny; and also according to 
the words he did confess.

38 And he was brought to prove
