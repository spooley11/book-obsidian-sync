30 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord God said unto me: a Make other 
plates;  and  thou  shalt  engraven 
many things upon them which are 
good in my sight, for the profit of 
thy people.

31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obe-
dient to the commandments of the 
Lord, went and made a these plates 
upon which I have engraven these 
things.

32 And  I  engraved  that  which 
is  pleasing  unto  God.  And  if  my 
people are pleased with the things 
of  God  they  will  be  pleased  with 
mine  engravings  which  are  upon 
these plates.

33 And  if  my  people  desire  to 
know the more particular part of 
the history of my people they must 
search mine a other b plates.

34 And it sufficeth me to say that 
forty  years  had  passed  away,  and 
we had already had wars and con-
tentions with our brethren.

CHAPTER 6

Jacob  recounts  Jewish  history:  The 
Babylonian  captivity  and  return;  the 
ministry  and  crucifixion  of  the  Holy 
One  of  Israel;  the  help  received  from 
the Gentiles; and the Jews’ latter-day 
restoration  when  they  believe  in  the 
Messiah. About 559–545 b.c.
The  a words  of  Jacob,  the  brother 
of Nephi, which he spake unto the 
people of Nephi:

2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, 
Jacob, having been called of God, 
and ordained after the manner of 
his  holy  a order,  and  having  been 
consecrated by my brother Nephi, 
unto whom ye look as a b king or a 
protector, and on whom ye depend 
for  safety,  behold  ye  know  that  I 
have spoken unto you exceedingly 
many things.

3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you 
again; for I am desirous for the a wel-
fare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety 
is great for you; and ye yourselves 
know  that  it  ever  has  been.  For  I 
have exhorted you with all diligence; 
and I have taught you the words of 
my father; and I have spoken unto 
you  concerning  all  things  which 
are  b written, from the creation of  
the world.
