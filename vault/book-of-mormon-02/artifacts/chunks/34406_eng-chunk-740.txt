5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up 
in a pride; yea, how quick to b boast, 
and do all manner of that which is 
iniquity; and how slow are they to 
remember the Lord their God, and 
to give ear unto his counsels, yea, 
how slow to c walk in wisdom’s paths!
6 Behold, they do not desire that 
the Lord their God, who hath a cre-
ated them, should b rule and reign 
over  them;  notwithstanding  his 
great  goodness  and  his  mercy  to-
wards them, they do set at c naught 
his counsels, and they will not that 
he should be their guide.

7 O how great is the a nothingness of 
the children of men; yea, even they  
are b less than the dust of the earth.
8 For behold, the dust of the earth 
moveth hither and thither, to the 
dividing asunder, at the command 
of our great and everlasting God.

9 Yea, behold at his a voice do the

hills  and  the  mountains  tremble 
and b quake.

10 And by the a power of his voice 
they  are  broken  up,  and  become 
smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.
11 Yea, by the power of his voice

doth the a whole earth shake;

12 Yea, by the power of his voice, 
do  the  foundations  rock,  even  to 
the very center.

13 Yea,  and  if  he  say  unto  the

earth—Move—it is moved.

14 Yea, if he say unto the a earth—
Thou shalt b go back, that it c lengthen 
out the day for many hours—it is 
done;

15 And  thus,  according  to  his 
word the a earth goeth back, and it 
appeareth unto man that the b sun 
standeth still; yea, and behold, this 
is so; for surely it is the earth that 
moveth and not the sun.

16 And behold, also, if he say unto 
the a waters of the great deep—b Be 
thou dried up—it is done.

17 Behold,  if  he  say  unto  this 
mountain—Be thou raised up, and 
a come over and fall upon that city, 
that it be buried up—behold it is 
done.

18 And behold, if a man a hide up a 
treasure in the earth, and the Lord 
shall say—Let it be  b accursed, be-
cause  of the  iniquity  of him  who 
hath hid it up—behold, it shall be 
accursed.
