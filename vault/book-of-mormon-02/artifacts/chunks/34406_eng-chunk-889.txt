might  have  received  in  the  land, 
for the a Gentiles who shall possess 
the land.

20 But  behold,  it  shall  come  to 
pass that they shall be driven and 
scattered by the Gentiles; and after 
they have been driven and scattered 
by the Gentiles, behold, then will 
the Lord a remember the b covenant 
which he made unto Abraham and 
unto all the house of Israel.

21 And also the Lord will remem-
ber  the  a prayers  of  the  righteous, 
which have been put up unto him 
for them.

22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how 
can  ye  stand  before  the  power  of 
God,  except  ye  shall  repent  and 
turn from your evil ways?

23 Know ye not that ye are in the 
a hands of God? Know ye not that 
he hath all power, and at his great 
command the b earth shall be c rolled 
together as a scroll?

24 Therefore, repent ye, and hum-
ble yourselves before him, lest he 
shall  come  out  in  justice  against 
you—lest a a remnant of the seed of 
Jacob shall go forth among you as 
a b lion, and tear you in pieces, and 
there is none to deliver.

CHAPTER 6
The Nephites gather to the land of Cu-
morah for the final battles—Mormon 
hides the sacred records in the hill Cu-
morah—The Lamanites are victorious, 
and the Nephite nation is destroyed—
Hundreds of thousands are slain with 
the sword. About a.d. 385.
And now I finish my record concern-
ing the a destruction of my people, 
the Nephites. And it came to pass

that we did march forth before the 
Lamanites.

2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epis-
tle unto the king of the Lamanites, 
and desired of him that he would 
grant unto us that we might gather 
together our people unto the a land 
of  b Cumorah, by a hill which was 
called Cumorah, and there we could 
give them battle.
