into that quarter where there never 
had man been. And it came to pass 
that the Lord did go before them, 
and did talk with them as he stood 
in  a  b cloud,  and  gave  c directions 
whither they should travel.

6 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they  
did travel in the wilderness, and did 
a build  b barges,  in  which  they  did 
cross many waters, being directed 
continually by the hand of the Lord.
7 And the Lord would not suffer 
that they should stop beyond the 
sea in the wilderness, but he would 
that they should come forth even 
unto  the  a land  of  promise,  which 
was  choice  above  all  other  lands, 
which the Lord God had b preserved 
for a righteous people.

8 And he had sworn in his wrath 
unto  the  brother  of  Jared,  that 
whoso should possess this land of 
promise, from that time henceforth 
and forever, should a serve him, the 
true and only God, or they should 
be  b swept off when the fulness of 
his wrath should come upon them.
9 And now, we can behold the de-
crees of God concerning this land, 
that  it  is  a  land  of  promise;  and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it 
shall  serve  God,  or  they  shall  be 
a swept off when the fulness of his 
b wrath shall come upon them. And 
the  fulness  of  his  wrath  cometh 
upon them when they are c ripened  
in iniquity.

10 For behold, this is a land which 
is  choice  above  all  other  lands; 
wherefore  he  that  doth  possess  it 
shall serve God or shall be a swept 
off; for it is the everlasting decree of 
God. And it is not until the b fulness 
of iniquity among the children of 
the land, that they are c swept off.
