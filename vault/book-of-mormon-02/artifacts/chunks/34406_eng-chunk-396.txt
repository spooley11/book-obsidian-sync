NOW it came to pass that in

the  first  year  of  the  reign  
of the judges over the people 
of Nephi, from this time forward, 
king Mosiah having a gone the way 
of  all  the  earth,  having  warred  a 
good  warfare,  walking  uprightly 
before God, leaving none to reign 
in  his  stead;  nevertheless  he  had 
established  b laws,  and  they  were 
acknowledged by the people; there-
fore they were obliged to abide by 
the c laws which he had made.

2 And it came to pass that in the 
first year of the reign of Alma in 
the judgment-seat, there was a a man 
brought before him to be judged, a 
man who was large, and was noted 
for his much strength.

3 And he had gone about among 
the people, preaching to them that 
which he  a termed to be the word 
of God, bearing down b against the 
church; declaring unto the people 
that every priest and teacher ought 
to become c popular; and they ought 
d not to labor with their hands, but 
that they ought to be supported by 
the people.
