CHAPTER 39
Sexual  sin  is  an  abomination—Cori-
anton’s  sins  kept  the  Zoramites  from 
receiving the word—Christ’s redemption 
is retroactive in saving the faithful who 
preceded it. About 74 b.c.
And now, my a son, I have somewhat 
more to say unto thee than what I 
said unto thy brother; for behold, 
have ye not observed the steadiness 
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and 
his diligence in keeping the com-
mandments of God? Behold, has he 
not set a good b example for thee?

2 For thou didst not give so much 
heed  unto  my  words  as  did  thy 
brother,  among  the  people  of  the 
a Zoramites. Now this is what I have 
against thee; thou didst go on unto

boasting  in  thy  strength  and  thy 
wisdom.

3 And this is not all, my son. Thou 
didst  do  that  which  was  grievous 
unto me; for thou didst forsake the 
ministry, and did go over into the 
land  of  Siron  among  the  borders 
of the Lamanites, after the a harlot 
Isabel.

4 Yea,  she  did  a steal  away  the 
hearts of many; but this was no ex-
cuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst 
have tended to the ministry where-
with thou wast entrusted.

5 Know ye not, my son, that these 
things  are  an  abomination  in  the 
sight of the Lord; yea, most a abomi-
nable above all sins save it be the 
shedding of innocent b blood or de-
nying the Holy Ghost?
