them (for it was unto the king and to  
his servants) all the journeyings of 
their fathers in the wilderness, and 
all their sufferings with hunger and 
thirst, and their travail, and so forth.
38 And he also rehearsed unto them 
concerning the a rebellions of Laman 
and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, 
yea, all their rebellions did he relate 
unto them; and he expounded unto 
them all the b records and scriptures 
from the time that Lehi left Jerusa-
lem down to the present time.

39 But this is not all; for he  a ex-
pounded  unto  them  the  b plan  of 
redemption,  which  was  prepared 
from the foundation of the world; 
and he also made known unto them 
concerning  the  coming  of  Christ, 
and all the works of the Lord did 
he make known unto them.

40 And it came to pass that after 
he  had  said  all  these  things,  and 
expounded them to the king, that 
the king a believed all his words.

41 And he began to cry unto the 
Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; 
according to thy abundant a mercy 
which thou hast had upon the peo-
ple  of  Nephi,  have  upon  me,  and 
my people.

42 And  now,  when  he  had  said 
this, he  a fell unto the earth,  b as if 
he were dead.

43 And  it  came  to  pass  that  his 
a servants took him and carried him 
in unto his wife, and laid him upon 
a bed; and he lay as if he were dead 
for the space of two days and two 
nights; and his wife, and his sons, 
and  his  daughters  mourned  over 
him,  after  the  manner  of  the  La-
manites, greatly lamenting his loss.
