the governor, was a just man, and 
could  not  be  frightened  by  the 
demands  and  the  threatenings  of 
a  a robber;  therefore  he  did  not 
heark en to the epistle of Giddianhi, 
the governor of the robbers, but he 
did cause that his people should cry 
unto the Lord for b strength against 
the  time  that  the  robbers  should 
come down against them.

13 Yea,  he  sent  a  proclamation 
among  all  the  people,  that  they 
should a gather together their women, 
and their children, their flocks and  
their herds, and all their substance, 
save it were their land, unto one place.
14 And he caused that a fortifica-
tions should be built round about 
them,  and  the  strength  thereof 
should be exceedingly great. And 
he caused that armies, both of the 
Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of 
all them who were numbered among 
the Nephites, should be placed as 
guards round about to watch them, 
and to guard them from the robbers 
day and night.

15 Yea, he said unto them: As the 
Lord liveth, except ye repent of all 
your  iniquities,  and  cry  unto  the 
Lord, ye will in nowise be a delivered  
out of the hands of those Gadianton  
robbers.

16 And  so  great  and  marvelous 
were the words and prophecies of 
Lachoneus that they did cause fear 
to come upon all the people; and 
they did exert themselves in their 
might to do according to the words 
of Lachoneus.

17 And  it  came  to  pass  that  La-
choneus did appoint chief captains  
over all the armies of the Nephites, 
to command them at the time that 
the robbers should come down out 
of the wilderness against them.

18 Now the chiefest among all the

chief captains and the great com-
mander  of  all  the  armies  of  the 
Nephites  was  appointed,  and  his 
name was a Gidgiddoni.
