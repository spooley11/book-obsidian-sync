23 And it came to pass that Nephi 
went forth among the people, and 
also  many  others,  baptizing  unto 
repentance, in the which there was 
a great a remission of sins. And thus 
the  people  began  again  to  have 
peace in the land.

24 And there were no contentions, 
save  it  were  a  few  that  began  to 
preach,  endeavoring  to  prove  by 
the a scriptures that it was no more 
expedient  to  observe  the  law  of 
Moses. Now in this thing they did 
err,  having  not  understood  the  
scriptures.

25 But  it  came  to  pass  that  they 
soon became converted, and were 
convinced of the error which they 
were  in,  for  it  was  made  known 
unto them that the law was not yet 
a fulfilled, and that it must be ful-
filled in every whit; yea, the word 
came  unto  them  that  it  must  be 
fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle 
should not pass away till it should 
all  be  fulfilled;  therefore  in  this 
same year were they brought to a 
knowledge  of  their  error  and  did 
b confess their faults.

year did pass away, bringing a glad 
tidings unto the people because of 
the signs which did come to pass, 
according to the words of the proph-
ecy of all the holy prophets.

27 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
ninety and third year did also pass 
away in peace, save it were for the 
Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon 
the a mountains, who did infest the 
land; for so strong were their holds 
and  their  secret  places  that  the 
people could not overpower them; 
therefore  they  did  commit  many 
murders, and did do much slaugh-
ter among the people.
