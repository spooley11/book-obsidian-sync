that  he  sendeth  down  his  b wrath 
upon you as in the  c first provoca-

the last provocation as well as the 
first, to the everlasting d destruction 
of your souls; therefore, according 
to his word, unto the last death, as 
well as the first.

CHAPTER 13

Men are called as high priests because  
of their exceeding faith and good works—
They are to teach the commandments—
Through righteousness they are sanctified 
and enter into the rest of the Lord—Mel-
chizedek was one of these—Angels are 
declaring  glad  tidings  throughout  the 
land—They will declare the actual com-
ing of Christ. About 82 b.c.
