CHAPTER 42
Mortality is a probationary time to en-
able man to repent and serve God—The 
Fall  brought  temporal  and  spiritual 
death upon all mankind—Redemption  
comes through repentance—God Himself 
atones for the sins of the world—Mercy  
is for those who repent—All others are 
subject to God’s justice—Mercy comes 
because  of  the  Atonement—Only  the 
truly penitent are saved. About 74 b.c.
And now, my son, I perceive there 
is  somewhat  more  which  doth 
worry your mind, which ye cannot 
understand—which is concerning 
the a justice of God in the b punish-
ment  of  the  sinner;  for  ye  do  try 
to suppose that it is c injustice that 
the sinner should be consigned to 
a state of misery.

2 Now behold, my son, I will explain 
this  thing  unto  thee.  For  behold,  
after  the  Lord  God  sent  our  first

parents  forth  from  the  garden  of 
a Eden,  to  till  the  b ground,  from 
whence they were taken—yea, he 
drew out the man, and he placed at 
the east end of the garden of Eden, 
c cherubim,  and  a  flaming  sword 
which turned every way, to keep the  
tree of life—

3 Now, we see that the man had 
become as God, knowing good and 
evil;  and  lest  he  should  put  forth 
his hand, and take also of the tree 
of life, and eat and live forever, the 
Lord God placed a cherubim and the 
flaming sword, that he should not 
partake of the fruit—

4 And thus we see, that there was 
a a time granted unto man to repent, 
yea, a b probationary time, a time to 
repent and serve God.

5 For behold, if Adam had put forth 
his  hand  immediately,  and  a par-
taken of the b tree of life, he would 
have lived forever, according to the 
word of God, having no space for 
repentance; yea, and also the word 
of God would have been void, and 
the great plan of salvation would 
have been frustrated.

6 But  behold,  it  was  appointed 
unto  man  to  a die—therefore,  as 
they were cut off from the tree of 
life  they  should  be  cut  off  from 
the face of the earth—and man be-
came b lost forever, yea, they became  
c fallen man.
