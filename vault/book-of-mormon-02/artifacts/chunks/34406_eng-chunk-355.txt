17 And  now  Limhi  was  desirous 
that  his  father  should  not  be  de-
stroyed;  nevertheless,  Limhi  was

father, he himself being a just man.
18 And it came to pass that Gideon 
sent  men  into  the  wilderness  se-
cretly,  to  search  for  the  king  and 
those  that  were  with  him.  And  it 
came to pass that they met the peo-
ple in the wilderness, all save the 
king and his priests.

19 Now  they  had  sworn  in  their
