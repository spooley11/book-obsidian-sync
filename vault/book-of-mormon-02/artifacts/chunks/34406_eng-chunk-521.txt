32 For  behold,  they  had  rather 
a sacrifice  their  lives  than  even  to 
take  the  life  of  their  enemy;  and 
they have b buried their weapons of 
war deep in the earth, because of 
their love towards their brethren.

33 And now behold I say unto you, 
has there been so great love in all 
the  land?  Behold,  I  say  unto  you, 
Nay, there has not, even among the 
Nephites.

34 For  behold,  they  would  take 
up  arms  against  their  brethren; 
they  would  not  suffer  themselves 
to be slain. But behold how a many 
of these have laid down their lives; 
and we know that they have gone 
to their God, because of their love 
and of their hatred to sin.

35 Now  have  we  not  reason  to 
rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there 
never were men that had so great 
reason  to  rejoice  as  we,  since  the 
world  began;  yea,  and  my  joy  is 
carried  away,  even  unto  boasting 
in my God; for he has all  a power, 
b all wisdom, and all understanding; 
he comprehendeth all things, and

he is a c merciful Being, even unto 
salvation, to those who will repent 
and believe on his name.

36 Now if this is a boasting, even so 
will I boast; for this is my life and 
my light, my joy and my salvation, 
and my redemption from everlast-
ing  wo.  Yea,  blessed  is  the  name  
of my God, who has been mindful of  
this people, who are a b branch of the  
tree  of  Israel,  and  has  been  c lost 
from its body in a strange land; yea,  
I  say,  blessed  be  the  name  of  my 
God, who has been mindful of us, 
d wanderers in a strange land.

37 Now my brethren, we see that 
God is  a mindful of every  b people, 
whatsoever  land  they  may  be  in; 
yea, he numbereth his people, and 
his bowels of mercy are over all the 
earth. Now this is my joy, and my 
great thanksgiving; yea, and I will 
give thanks unto my God forever. 
Amen.
