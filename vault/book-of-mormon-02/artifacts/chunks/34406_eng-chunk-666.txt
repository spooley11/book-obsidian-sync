11 Yea,  and  it  came  to  pass  that  
the Lord our God did visit us with 
assurances  that  he  would  deliver 
us; yea, insomuch that he did speak 
peace  to  our  souls,  and  did  grant  
unto us great faith, and did cause 
us  that  we  should  hope  for  our  
a deliverance in him.

12 And we did take courage with 
our small force which we had re-
ceived, and were fixed with a deter-
mination to conquer our enemies, 
and to a maintain our lands, and our  
possessions,  and  our  wives,  and 
our children, and the cause of our 
b liberty.

13 And thus we did go forth with 
all  our  might  against  the  Laman-
ites, who were in the city of Manti; 
and we did pitch our tents by the 
wilderness  side,  which  was  near 
to the city.

14 And it came to pass that on the 
morrow, that when the Lamanites 
saw that we were in the borders by 
the wilderness which was near the 
city, that they sent out their spies 
round about us that they might dis-
cover the number and the strength 
of our army.

15 And it came to pass that when 
they saw that we were not strong,

according  to  our  numbers,  and 
fearing  that  we  should  cut  them 
off from their support except they 
should come out to battle against 
us and kill us, and also supposing 
that  they  could  easily  destroy  us 
with their numerous hosts, therefore 
they began to make preparations to 
come out against us to battle.

16 And  when  we  saw  that  they 
were making preparations to come 
out  against  us,  behold,  I  caused 
that Gid, with a small number of 
men, should a secrete himself in the 
wilderness, and also that Teomner 
and a small number of men should 
secrete  themselves  also  in  the  
wilderness.

17 Now Gid and his men were on 
the right and the others on the left; 
and when they had thus secreted 
themselves,  behold,  I  remained, 
with the remainder of my army, in 
that same place where we had first 
pitched our tents against the time 
that  the  Lamanites  should  come 
out to battle.
