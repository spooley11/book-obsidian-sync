13 And now, my brethren, I would 
that ye should humble yourselves 
before God, and bring forth a fruit 
meet for repentance, that ye may 
also enter into that rest.

14 Yea, humble yourselves even as 
the people in the days of a Melchi-
zedek, who was also a high priest 
after this same order which I have

spoken,  who  also  took  upon  him 
the high priesthood forever.

15 And it was this same Melchizedek 
to whom Abraham paid a tithes; yea, 
even our father Abraham paid tithes 
of one-tenth part of all he possessed.
16 Now  these  a ordinances  were 
given after this b manner, that there-
by the people might look forward 
on the Son of God, it being a c type 
of his order, or it being his order, 
and this that they might look for-
ward to him for a remission of their 
sins, that they might enter into the  
rest of the Lord.

17 Now  this  Melchizedek  was  a 
king  over  the  land  of  Salem;  and 
his people had waxed strong in in-
iquity and abomination; yea, they 
had all gone astray; they were full 
of all manner of wickedness;

18 But Melchizedek having exer-
cised mighty faith, and received the 
office of the high priesthood accord-
ing to the a holy order of God, did 
preach repentance unto his people. 
And behold, they did repent; and 
Melchizedek did establish peace in 
the land in his days; therefore he 
was called the prince of peace, for 
he was the king of Salem; and he 
did reign under his father.

19 Now, there were a many before 
him, and also there were many af-
terwards, but  b none were greater; 
therefore, of him they have more 
particularly made mention.

20 Now  I  need  not  rehearse  the 
matter; what I have said may suf-
fice.  Behold,  the  a scriptures  are
