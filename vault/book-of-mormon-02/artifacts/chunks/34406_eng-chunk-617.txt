32 And now it came to pass that the  
queen,  when  she  had  heard  that 
the king was slain—for Amalickiah 
had sent an embassy to the queen 
informing  her  that  the  king  had 
been slain by his servants, that he 
had pursued them with his army, 
but  it  was  in  vain,  and  they  had 
made their escape—

33 Therefore, when the queen had 
received this message she sent unto 
Amalickiah,  desiring  him  that  he 
would spare the people of the city; 
and  she  also  desired  him  that  he 
should come in unto her; and she 
also  desired  him  that  he  should 
bring a witnesses with him to testify 
concerning the death of the king.
34 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah took the same servant that 
slew  the  king,  and  all  them  who

were with him, and went in unto 
the  queen,  unto  the  place  where 
she sat; and they all a testified unto 
her that the king was slain by his 
own  servants;  and  they  said  also: 
They have fled; does not this tes-
tify  against  them?  And  thus  they 
satisfied the queen concerning the 
death of the king.

35 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah  sought  the  a favor  of  the 
queen,  and  took  her  unto  him  to 
wife; and thus by his b fraud, and by  
the assistance of his cunning ser-
vants, he c obtained the kingdom; yea, 
he was acknowledged king through-
out  all  the  land,  among  all  the  
people of the Lamanites, who were 
d composed  of  the  Lamanites  and 
the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, 
and all the dissenters of the Neph-
ites, from the reign of Nephi down  
to the present time.
