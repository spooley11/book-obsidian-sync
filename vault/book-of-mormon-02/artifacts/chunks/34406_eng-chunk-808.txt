41 And  whosoever  shall  compel 
thee to a go a mile, go with him twain.
42 a Give to him that asketh thee, 
and from him that would b borrow 
of thee turn thou not away.

43 And behold it is written also, 
that thou shalt love thy neighbor and  
hate thine enemy;

44 But behold I say unto you, love 
your a enemies, bless them that curse 
you, do b good to them that hate you, 
and c pray for them who despitefully 
use you and persecute you;

45 That ye may be the children of 
your Father who is in heaven; for 
he maketh his sun to rise  a on the 
evil and on the good.

46 Therefore those things which 
were of old time, which were un-
der the law, in me are all a fulfilled.
47 a Old things are done away, and

all things have become b new.

48 Therefore I would that ye should  
be a perfect even as I, or your Father 
who is in heaven is perfect.

CHAPTER 13
Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s 
Prayer—They are to lay up treasures in 
heaven—The twelve disciples in their 
ministry  are  commanded  to  take  no 
thought for temporal things—Compare 
Matthew 6. About a.d. 34.
a Verily, verily, I say that I would 
that  ye  should  do  alms  unto  the 
poor; but take heed that ye do not 
your alms before men to be seen of 
them; otherwise ye have no reward 
of your Father who is in heaven.

2 Therefore, when ye shall do your 
alms do not sound a trumpet before 
you,  as  will  hypocrites  do  in  the 
synagogues and in the streets, that 
they may have a glory of men. Ver-
ily I say unto you, they have their  
reward.

3 But  when  thou  doest  alms  let 
not  thy  left  hand  know  what  thy 
right hand doeth;

4 That  thine  alms  may  be  in  se-
cret; and thy Father who seeth in 
secret,  himself  shall  reward  thee  
openly.

5 And  when  thou  a prayest  thou 
shalt not do as the b hypocrites, for
