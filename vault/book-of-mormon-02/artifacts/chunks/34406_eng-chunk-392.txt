19 And were it not for the inter-
position  of  their  all-wise  Creator, 
and  this  because  of  their  sincere 
repentance, they must unavoidably 
remain in bondage until now.

20 But behold, he did deliver them

because  they  did  a humble  them-
selves before him; and because they 
b cried  mightily  unto  him  he  did 
deliver them out of bondage; and 
thus doth the Lord work with his 
power in all cases among the chil-
dren of men, extending the arm of 
c mercy towards them that put their 
d trust in him.

21 And  behold,  now  I  say  unto 
you, ye cannot dethrone an iniqui-
tous a king save it be through much 
contention,  and  the  shedding  of 
much blood.

22 For behold, he has his a friends 
in  iniquity,  and  he  keepeth  his 
guards about him; and he teareth up 
the laws of those who have reigned 
in righteousness before him; and he 
trampleth under his feet the com-
mandments of God;

23 And he enacteth laws, and send-
eth them forth among his people, 
yea, laws after the manner of his 
own  wickedness;  and  whosoever 
doth not obey his laws he a causeth 
to be destroyed; and whosoever doth 
rebel against him he will send his 
armies against them to war, and if 
he  can  he  will  destroy  them;  and 
thus an unrighteous b king doth per-
vert the ways of all righteousness.
24 And now behold I say unto you, 
it is not expedient that such abomi-
nations should come upon you.

25 Therefore,  choose  you  by  the 
a voice of this people, judges, that 
ye may be b judged according to the 
c laws  which  have  been  given  you 
by our fathers, which are correct, 
and which were given them by the 
hand of the Lord.

26 Now  it  is  not  common  that 
the  a voice  of  the  people  desireth
