36 And  it  came  to  pass  after  my 
father had spoken all the words of 
his  dream  or  vision,  which  were 
many,  he  said  unto  us,  because 
of these things which he saw in a 
vision,  he  exceedingly  feared  for 
Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared 
lest  they  should  be  cast  off  from 
the presence of the Lord.

37 And he did a exhort them then 
with all the feeling of a tender par-
ent, that they would hearken to his 
words, that perhaps the Lord would 
be merciful to them, and not cast 
them off; yea, my father did preach 
unto them.

38 And  after  he  had  preached  
unto them, and also prophesied unto 
them of many things, he bade them

to keep the commandments of the 
Lord;  and  he  did  cease  speaking 
unto them.

CHAPTER 9

Nephi makes two sets of records—Each 
is called the plates of Nephi—The larger 
plates  contain  a  secular  history;  the 
smaller ones deal primarily with sacred 
things. About 600–592 b.c.
And all these things did my father 
see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt 
in a tent, in the a valley of Lemuel, 
and also a great many more things, 
which cannot be written upon these 
plates.

2 And now, as I have spoken con-
cerning  these  plates,  behold  they 
are  not  the  plates  upon  which  I 
make a full account of the history 
of my people; for the a plates upon 
which I make a full account of my 
people  I  have  given  the  name  of 
Nephi; wherefore, they are called 
the plates of Nephi, after mine own 
name;  and  these  plates  also  are 
called the plates of Nephi.

3 Nevertheless, I have received a 
commandment  of  the  Lord  that  I 
should  make  these  plates,  for  the 
special a purpose that there should 
be an account engraven of the b min-
istry of my people.

4 Upon the other plates should be 
engraven an account of the reign 
of the kings, and the wars and con-
tentions  of  my  people;  wherefore 
these plates are for the more part of 
the ministry; and the a other plates 
are for the more part of the reign 
of the kings and the wars and con-
tentions of my people.
