chosen  the  good  part,  according 
to the words of the prophet. And I 
have none other object save it be the

Amen.

CHAPTER 3
Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in vi-
sion—He prophesied of Joseph Smith, 
the latter-day seer; of Moses, who would 
deliver Israel; and of the coming forth of 
the Book of Mormon. About 588–570 b.c.
And now I speak unto you, Joseph, 
my  a last-born. Thou wast born in 
the wilderness of mine afflictions; 
yea, in the days of my greatest sor-
row did thy mother bear thee.

2 And  may  the  Lord  consecrate 
also unto thee this a land, which is 
a most precious land, for thine in-
heritance  and  the  inheritance  of 
thy seed with thy brethren, for thy 
security forever, if it so be that ye 
shall  keep  the  commandments  of 
the Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, Joseph, my last-born, 
whom  I  have  brought  out  of  the 
wilderness of mine afflictions, may 
the Lord bless thee forever, for thy 
a seed shall not utterly be b destroyed.
4 For behold, thou art the fruit of 
my loins; and I am a descendant of 
a Joseph  who  was  carried  b captive 
into Egypt. And great were the c cov-
enants of the Lord which he made 
unto Joseph.

5 Wherefore, Joseph truly a saw our 
day.  And  he  obtained  a  b promise 
of the Lord, that out of the fruit of 
his loins the Lord God would raise

up  a  c righteous  d branch  unto  the 
house of Israel; not the Messiah, but 
a branch which was to be broken 
off, nevertheless, to be remembered 
in the covenants of the Lord that 
the Messiah should be made e mani-
fest unto them in the latter days, in 
the spirit of power, unto the bring-
ing of them out of  f darkness unto 
light—yea, out of hidden darkness 
and out of captivity unto freedom.
6 For  Joseph  truly  testified,  say-
ing: A a seer shall the Lord my God 
raise up, who shall be a choice seer 
unto the fruit of my b loins.
