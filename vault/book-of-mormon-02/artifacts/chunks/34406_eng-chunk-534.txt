24 Ye  say  that  this  people  is  a 
free people. Behold, I say they are 
in bondage. Ye say that those an-
cient prophecies are true. Behold, 
I say that ye do not know that they 
are true.

25 Ye say that this people is a guilty 
and a fallen people, because of the 
transgression of a parent. Behold, 
I say that a child is not guilty be-
cause of its parents.

26 And  ye  also  say  that  Christ 
shall come. But behold, I say that 
ye do not know that there shall be a 
Christ. And ye say also that he shall 
be slain for the a sins of the world—
27 And  thus  ye  lead  away  this 
people after the foolish traditions 
of  your  fathers,  and  according  to 
your own desires; and ye keep them

down, even as it were in bondage, 
that  ye  may  glut  yourselves  with 
the labors of their hands, that they 
durst  not  look  up  with  boldness, 
and that they durst not enjoy their 
rights and privileges.

28 Yea,  they  durst  not  make  use 
of that which is their own lest they 
should offend their priests, who do  
yoke them according to their desires, 
and have brought them to believe, 
by their traditions and their dreams 
and their whims and their visions 
and  their  pretended  mysteries, 
that they should, if they did not do  
according  to  their  words,  offend 
some  unknown  being,  who  they 
say is God—a being who a never has 
been  seen  or  known,  who  b never 
was nor ever will be.

29 Now when the high priest and 
the a chief judge saw the hardness 
of  his  heart,  yea,  when  they  saw 
that he would b revile even against 
God, they would not make any reply  
to his words; but they caused that 
he should be bound; and they de-
livered  him  up  into  the  hands  of 
the  officers,  and  sent  him  to  the 
land of Zarahemla, that he might 
be  brought  before  Alma,  and  the 
chief judge who was governor over 
all the land.

30 And it came to pass that when 
he  was  brought  before  Alma  and 
the  chief  judge,  he  did  go  on  in 
the same manner as he did in the 
land of Gideon; yea, he went on to 
a blaspheme.
