36 Nevertheless,  I  know  that  the 
roots are good, and for mine own 
purpose I have preserved them; and 
because of their much strength they 
have hitherto brought forth, from 
the wild branches, good fruit.

37 But behold, the wild branches 
have grown and have a overrun the 
roots  thereof;  and  because  that  
the wild branches have overcome the  
roots thereof it hath brought forth 
much evil fruit; and because that 
it hath brought forth so much evil 
fruit thou beholdest that it begin-
neth to perish; and it will soon be-
come ripened, that it may be cast 
into the fire, except we should do 
something for it to preserve it.

38 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord of the vineyard said unto his 
servant:  Let  us  go  down  into  the 
nethermost parts of the vineyard, 
and behold if the natural branches 
have also brought forth evil fruit.

JACOB 5  : 40–50

went  down  into  the  nethermost 
parts of the vineyard. And it came 
to  pass  that  they  beheld  that  the 
fruit of the natural branches had 
become corrupt also; yea, the a first 
and  the  second  and  also  the  last; 
and they had all become corrupt.

40 And the a wild fruit of the last 
had overcome that part of the tree 
which  brought  forth  good  fruit, 
even that the branch had withered 
away and died.

41 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the 
Lord  of  the  vineyard  wept,  and 
said unto the servant: a What could 
I have done more for my vineyard?
42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of 
the vineyard, save it were these, had 
become a corrupted. And now these 
which have once brought forth good 
fruit  have  also  become  corrupted; 
and now all the trees of my vineyard 
are good for nothing save it be to be 
b hewn down and cast into the fire.
