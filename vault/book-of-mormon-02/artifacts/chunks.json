It is a record of God\u2019s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the\n\nAmericas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.\n\nThe  book  was  written  by  many  ancient  prophets  by  the  spirit  of \nprophecy  and  revelation.  Their  words,  written  on  gold  plates,  were \nquoted  and  abridged  by  a  prophet-historian  named  Mormon.  The \nrecord gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Je-\nrusalem  in  600 b.c.  and  afterward  separated  into  two  nations,  known \nas the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when \nthe Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is \nknown as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed ex-\ncept the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American \nIndians.",

    "text": "The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal \nministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His res-\nurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of \nsalvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and \neternal salvation in the life to come.\n\nAfter Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his \nson Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in \nthe Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glo-\nrified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and in-\nstructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation \ninto the English language.\n\nIn due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated \nthem by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many \nlanguages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of \nthe living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws \nand ordinances of His gospel may be saved.\n\nConcerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \u201cI told the breth-\nren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, \nand the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by \nabiding by its precepts, than by any other book.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see \nthe gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and \ndivinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included \nherewith as \u201cThe Testimony of Three Witnesses\u201d and \u201cThe Testimony of \nEight Witnesses.\u201d\n\nWe invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder \nin their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal \nFather, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this \ncourse and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by \nthe power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3\u20135.)",

It was a whiteness \nbeyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly \nthing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His \nhands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were \nhis feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and \nneck were also bare.

When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the \nfear soon left me.\n\n\u201cHe called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent \nfrom the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God \nhad a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and \nevil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both \ngood and evil spoken of among all people.\n\n\u201cHe said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an \naccount of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from \nwhence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel \nwas contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;\n\u201cAlso, that there were two stones in silver bows\u2014and these stones, fas-\ntened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thum-\nmim\u2014deposited  with  the  plates;  and  the  possession  and  use  of  these \nstones were what constituted \u2018seers\u2019 in ancient or former times; and that \nGod had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book. . . .\n\n\u201cAgain, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spo-\nken\u2014for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled\u2014I \nshould not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the \nUrim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to \nshow them; if I did I should be destroyed.

For no \nsooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions \nwere used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented \nwas resorted to for that purpose.

The former were more particularly devoted to spiritual \nmatters and the ministry and teachings of the prophets, while the lat-\nter were occupied mostly by a secular history of the peoples concerned \n(1 Nephi 9:2\u20134). From the time of Mosiah, however, the large plates also \nincluded items of major spiritual importance.\n\n2.  The Plates of Mormon, which consist of an abridgment by Mormon from \nthe large plates of Nephi, with many commentaries. These plates also \ncontained a continuation of the history by Mormon and additions by his \nson Moroni.\n\n3.  The Plates of Ether, which present a history of the Jaredites. This record \nwas abridged by Moroni, who inserted comments of his own and incorpo-\nrated the record with the general history under the title \u201cBook of Ether.\u201d\n  4.  The  Plates  of  Brass  brought by the people of Lehi from Jerusalem in  \n600 b.c. These contained \u201cthe five books of Moses, . . . and also a record of  \nthe Jews from the beginning, . . . down to the commencement of the reign  \nof Zedekiah, king of Judah; and also the prophecies of the holy prophets\u201d \n(1 Nephi 5:11\u201313). Many quotations from these plates, citing Isaiah and \nother biblical and nonbiblical prophets, appear in the Book of Mormon.\nThe Book of Mormon comprises fifteen main parts or divisions, known, \nwith one exception, as books, usually designated by the name of their princi-\npal author. The first portion (the first six books, ending with Omni) is a trans-\nlation from the small plates of Nephi. Between the books of Omni and Mosiah \nis an insert called the Words of Mormon. This insert connects the record \nengraved on the small plates with Mormon\u2019s abridgment of the large plates.\nThe longest portion, from Mosiah through Mormon chapter 7, is a trans-\nlation of Mormon\u2019s abridgment of the large plates of Nephi. The concluding \nportion, from Mormon chapter 8 to the end of the volume, was engraved \nby Mormon\u2019s son Moroni, who, after finishing the record of his father\u2019s life, \nmade an abridgment of the Jaredite record (as the book of Ether) and later \nadded the parts known as the book of Moroni.",

In a.d. 1823, this same Moroni, then a resurrected personage, visited \nthe Prophet Joseph Smith and subsequently delivered the engraved plates  \nto him.\n\nAbout this edition: The original title page, immediately preceding the contents  \npage, is taken from the plates and is part of the sacred text. Introductions in \na non-italic typeface, such as in 1 Nephi and immediately preceding Mosiah \nchapter 9, are also part of the sacred text. Introductions in italics, such as in \nchapter headings, are not original to the text but are study helps included for \nconvenience in reading.\n\nSome minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of \nthe Book of Mormon.

About 74 b.c.\nAnd now, my son, I perceive there \nis  somewhat  more  which  doth \nworry your mind, which ye cannot \nunderstand\u2014which is concerning \nthe a\u200ajustice of God in the b\u200apunish-\nment  of  the  sinner;  for  ye  do  try \nto suppose that it is c\u200ainjustice that \nthe sinner should be consigned to \na state of misery.\n\n2 Now behold, my son, I will explain \nthis  thing  unto  thee.  For  behold,  \nafter  the  Lord  God  sent  our  first\n\nparents  forth  from  the  garden  of \na\u200aEden,  to  till  the  b\u200aground,  from \nwhence they were taken\u2014yea, he \ndrew out the man, and he placed at \nthe east end of the garden of Eden, \nc\u200acherubim,  and  a  flaming  sword \nwhich turned every way, to keep the  \ntree of life\u2014\n\n3 Now, we see that the man had \nbecome as God, knowing good and \nevil;  and  lest  he  should  put  forth \nhis hand, and take also of the tree \nof life, and eat and live forever, the \nLord God placed a\u200acherubim and the \nflaming sword, that he should not \npartake of the fruit\u2014\n\n4 And thus we see, that there was \na a\u200atime granted unto man to repent, \nyea, a b\u200aprobationary time, a time to \nrepent and serve God.\n\n5 For behold, if Adam had put forth \nhis  hand  immediately,  and  a\u200apar-\ntaken of the b\u200atree of life, he would \nhave lived forever, according to the \nword of God, having no space for \nrepentance; yea, and also the word \nof God would have been void, and \nthe great plan of salvation would \nhave been frustrated.\n\n6 But  behold,  it  was  appointed \nunto  man  to  a\u200adie\u2014therefore,  as \nthey were cut off from the tree of \nlife  they  should  be  cut  off  from \nthe face of the earth\u2014and man be-\ncame b\u200alost forever, yea, they became  \nc\u200afallen man.",

About a.d. 375\u201384.\nAnd it came to pass that I did go \nforth among the Nephites, and did \nrepent  of  the  a\u200aoath  which  I  had  \nmade that I would no more assist \nthem; and they gave me command \nagain  of  their  armies,  for  they \nlooked upon me as though I could \ndeliver them from their afflictions.\n2 But behold, I was a\u200awithout hope, \nfor I knew the judgments of the Lord \nwhich should come upon them; for \nthey repented not of their iniqui-\nties, but did struggle for their lives \nwithout  calling  upon  that  Being \nwho created them.\n\n3 And  it  came  to  pass  that  the \nLamanites did come against us as \nwe had fled to the city of Jordan; \nbut behold, they were driven back \nthat  they  did  not  take  the  city  at \nthat time.\n\n4 And  it  came  to  pass  that  they \ncame  against  us  again,  and  we \ndid  maintain  the  city.  And  there \nwere also other cities which were \nmaintained by the Nephites, which \nstrongholds did cut them off that \nthey could not get into the country \nwhich lay before us, to destroy the \ninhabitants of our land.\n\n5 But it came to pass that whatso-\never lands we had passed by, and \nthe  inhabitants  thereof  were  not \ngathered in, were destroyed by the \nLamanites, and their towns, and vil-\nlages, and cities were burned with \nfire;  and  thus  three  hundred  and \nseventy and nine years passed away.\n6 And it came to pass that in the \nthree hundred and eightieth year \nthe  Lamanites  did  come  again \nagainst us to battle, and we did stand  \nagainst them boldly; but it was all in \nvain, for so a\u200agreat were their num-\nbers that they did tread the people \nof the Nephites under their feet.\n\n7 And it came to pass that we did  \nagain take to flight, and those whose \nflight was swifter than the Laman-\nites\u2019  did  escape,  and  those  whose \nflight did not exceed the Lamanites\u2019 \nwere swept down and destroyed.",
